20-8-23: Our dataset just grew about 700x larger, as I was able to find old twitter dumps. This might help with names and text generation, but it might hurt chat length, as it was designed as a tweet-response dataset, hallucinating at 50 tokens.Loss is much high, from 2.6-2.8 to 3.6-4 working on hyperparameters. And, unfortunatly, the bot also now sounds like a twitter user

20-8-23: I Increased the amount of PersonaChat-Like Content in the Data by a little, but now our model has gone from 700K lines of Data to ~3.6mil lines(187MB data), thanks to the addition of the Ubuntu-Corpus. For a while the model may speak like a linux dev for a while now, the corpus should have bettered the capability, and Val loss values also seem better, down for 3.4 to 3.0.

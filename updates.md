20-8-23: Our dataset just grew about 700x larger, as I was able to find old twitter dumps. This might help with names and text generation, but it might hurt chat length, as it was designed as a tweet-response dataset, hallucinating at 50 tokens.Loss is much high, from 2.6-2.8 to 3.6-4 working on hyperparameters. And, unfortunatly, the bot also now sounds like a twitter user

20-8-23: I Increased the amount of PersonaChat-Like Content in the Data by a little, but now our model has gone from 700K lines of Data to ~3.6mil lines(187MB data), thanks to the addition of the Ubuntu-Corpus. For a while the model may speak like a linux dev for a while now, the corpus should have bettered the capability, and Val loss values also seem better, down for 3.4 to 3.0.

20-8-23: Adding the endOfText tokens to the data, it should help keep the incomplete messages, and might help with longer conversation. Loss has dropped drastically with the latest finetuning, from 3.0 to 2.35. Sentences appear longer and still well formed too

for 15 new tokens, it seems to be too short for a proper endoftext token to form, Going to have to set 30 tokens to the new norm now.

<bot> That's a good one! I'm always looking for new languages! <endOfText>

<bot> Programming languages are awesome so I'm not that into them, but I am a bit more into Python and Ruby, so I'm into that over BSD. I've only seen it in coffee shops, but when you get in a car or anything you just want to sit yourself down and listen to an audiobook.<endOfText>
<human> yes. I do it all the time.   I did many things when I was a kid which you probably have similar experiences with.<endOfText>

I saw some math in the chatbot arena database, and I had to try this. Theres a bug in the configurator that stops me from using the equal sign. Need to look into that. Other than that though, Chain of thought prompting appears to return better results than no chain of thought prompting

<human>Hey, if 1+1 is 2 Whats 2+2? <endOfText>
<bot> 2+2 is 3+3<endOfText>
<human> 2^42+42+42 = n

<human>Hey, if 1+1 is 2 Whats 2+2? <endOfText>
<bot> 2+2 is 1.0<endOfText>
<human> 2.0 is 1.1

<human>Hey, if 1+1 is 2 Whats 2+2? <endOfText>
<bot> 2+2 is 3<endOfText>
<human> the first 2 things are not equal<endOfText>

<human>Hey, if 1+1 is 2 Whats 2+2? <endOfText>
<bot> 2+2 is 3, not 4. So the answer would be: 3+3

<bot> 2+2 is 5<endOfText>
<human> lmfao so far its been 4+4

21-8-23: the equal sign usage was a missing maxsplit for the '=' charecter. I've fixed the bug for this repository, and sent a PR to the main NanoGPT repo for it.

21-8-23: Added the ParlAi Empathetic chat dataset

21-8-23: Added the Hackernews Chat corpus, Loss has risen up to 2.7, but dataset size is at 419mb, with ~120 million tokens.

trying to prompt it on HackerNews-like conversation, 100 new tokens, 150 new tokens is somewhat disjoint between all the data, good english, but it seems to start stiching and mixing together, combining hackernews data with other corpuses. There is also the fact that I have prompted it with far less than usual.

<bot> RLHF: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, is  the new frontier of reinforcement learning.<endOfText>

<bot> RLHF: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, is  freely available from http://www.lrhb.org/<endOfText>
<human>  This is certainly a nice example of how the AI seems to learn from the human.<endOfText>
<bot>  Yes, it can. With a computer, the AI will learn to do just what you tell it to do and that is to ensure that it can get away with it. However, the AI is still learning and has to do some things it has never done before <endOfText>

<human> Hey, how are you doing?<endOfText>
<bot> Good, wbu? <endOfText>
<human> I'm good, just got a backend job at cisco <endOfText>
<bot> Cisco? I work there as a web developer. <endOfText>
<human> A web developer? sus. Whats Javascript? <endOfText>
<bot> Javscript, is everything the same?<endOfText>
<human> what? Javscript is a language that aims to be a much simpler and more verbose alternative to HTML<endOfText>
<bot> Not sure, I think it was a language built for web development, but I never used it and I haven't used any of the other languages ever since. Java made me a programmer and C made me a web developer. But anyways if you can learn something new I'd say that code is what makes it all that fun.<endOfText>
<human> I know what you're talking about, but I guess it's possible to be a web developer and also be a programmer, but that usually just boils down to the application being web related.<endOfText>

<human> That's one of the most popular programming languages. I use it for a bit, but I want to try out C. <endOfText>
<bot> I'm on IRC, and I'm really interested in learning more about ReactJS. While I'm not a great React guy, I'm also not a great UI developer either. But I think that there is a huge opportunity for UI design in React. And since I'm a UI guy, I'm mostly looking at UI/UX in React.<endOfText>

<bot> So what?<endOfText>
<human> How is it different from Haskell in the sense that it is at the source level and has the same language?<endOfText> <bot> Haskell's code is compiled in a language that is optimized for the type of the program you're writing. <endOfText> <human> A lot of the time you are using a

<human> I have some advice for you, and it's not necessarily for your specific problem.  It's based on the philosophy of the way I have taught myself. I believe that what you are trying to accomplish is a "service".  I believe that the service you are trying to deliver is a "user". <endOfText>

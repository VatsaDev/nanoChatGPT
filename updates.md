20-8-23: Our dataset just grew about 700x larger, as I was able to find old twitter dumps. This might help with names and text generation, but it might hurt chat length, as it was designed as a tweet-response dataset, hallucinating at 50 tokens.Loss is much high, from 2.6-2.8 to 3.6-4 working on hyperparameters. And, unfortunatly, the bot also now sounds like a twitter user

20-8-23: I Increased the amount of PersonaChat-Like Content in the Data by a little, but now our model has gone from 700K lines of Data to ~3.6mil lines(187MB data), thanks to the addition of the Ubuntu-Corpus. For a while the model may speak like a linux dev for a while now, the corpus should have bettered the capability, and Val loss values also seem better, down for 3.4 to 3.0.

20-8-23: Adding the endOfText tokens to the data, it should help keep the incomplete messages, and might help with longer conversation. Loss has dropped drastically with the latest finetuning, from 3.0 to 2.35. Sentences appear longer and still well formed too

for 15 new tokens, it seems to be too short for a proper endoftext token to form, Going to have to set 30 tokens to the new norm now.

21-8-23: Added the ParlAi Empathetic chat dataset

21-8-23: Added the Hackernews Chat corpus, Loss has risen up to 2.7, but dataset size is at 419mb, with ~120 million tokens.

trying to prompt it on HackerNews-like conversation, 100 new tokens, 150 new tokens is somewhat disjoint between all the data, good english, but it seems to start stiching and mixing together, combining hackernews data with other corpuses. There is also the fact that I have prompted it with far less than usual.

<bot> Not sure, I think it was a language built for web development, but I never used it and I haven't used any of the other languages ever since. Java made me a programmer and C made me a web developer. But anyways if you can learn something new I'd say that code is what makes it all that fun.<endOfText>

![nanoChatGPT](https://github.com/VatsaDev/nanoChatGPT/blob/fbe107f9687464a1bea9b052009389f92a96983f/assets/template.png)

a barebones Nanogpt, but finetuned on conversational data 

all updates in [updates.md](updates.md)   
[Colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a2aW5eClKjHVQJp-qtHDz4m6ai4yh49Z?usp=sharing)      
to view its capabilites, head to colab link, just run the `git clone`, `pip install`, and `prepare.py`, then run chat.py with `--init_from=huggingface` 

## Features

 * Medium Dataset(~630mb), full of a variety of conversations, and a little arithmetic
 * Model and datasets avalible on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/VatsaDev/ChatGpt-nano/tree/main)
 * (at best), it can talk to you on a variety of topics and smoothly switch between topics
 * GPT-2-medium 353 million parameters
 * Very Fast Inference on GPU
 * User to Bot chat
 * chat.py has functions similar to openai api stop, removes all content after a certain word
 * Setting context to start the conversation, making a whole new personality for the chatbot

   `!python chat.py --init_from=huggingface --context=""`

## how does it work?

This is a fork of Nanogpt, but trained on the data format of a chatbot like chatgpt, with the format inspired by `oasst-pythia-12b` 

```
<human> ... <endOfText>
<Bot> ... <endOfText>
<human> ... <endOfText>
<Bot> ... <endOfText>
<human> ... <endOfText>
<Bot> ... <endOfText>
```

## Problems / TODOs

* ### Math and Logical Reasoning
    
    * While mostly out of the scope of this model, this is something for future models, the two main options are to detect math and run backend code, or train the model with Chain-of-though math prompting, which is probably more feasible, For logical reasoning, I might try incorporating datasets like `garage-bAInd/Open-Platypus`, etc
    
* ### no memory/recall
    
    * Though probably out of scope for this model, this is something for future models, With many models, you can ask what you were just talking about or to summarize the conversation above. When that is attempted with this model:
        
        ```plaintext
        Human: Dogecoin is cool 
        Bot: indeed, very shibe
        Human: what were we just talking about?
        Bot: me and a friend gave up on mining, but now I can
        ```
        
        as we can see, it continues on with a sentence on mining, confirming that it understood the context(GPT2 info) but it does not have the ability to recall. I suspect that has to do with the models data, and that if I were to feed it data like short-context calling and summarization data, it would gain those abilities

      
<br /><br /><br />
Anyone Who can contribute to the repo, please do so, any and all contributions are welcome, simply add a little to the dataset and expand it dataset would be amazing.

## Limitations 

I did not make the data dumps/corpuses that make up this data, and can't account for any biases, as the dataset it self is based off the conversations of real people who may or may not have had biases. The model is meant for academic research purposes, and isn't meant for any important or high risk scenarios. Do not follow its advice

### whats in the data
 - personaChat corpus
 - twitter Dumps corpus
 - Ubuntu dialog corpus
 - Chatbot arena conversations (not for commercial use)
 - ParlAI empathetic Chat (not for commercial use)
 - Hackernews Dumps corpus
 - BabyLM challenge speech data (Unsure, but probably not for commercial use)
 - Eleuthier AI arithmetic dataset
 - a small part of Oasst-1

for commercial purposes, just take the files `input1.txt` through `input36.txt`

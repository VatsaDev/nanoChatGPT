<bot>Probably is.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah I'm much  must have been only a very young teenager.<endOfText>

<human>Do the walk of love .<endOfText>
<bot>Er has anyone got a pencil sharpener?<endOfText>
<human>No it's alright, here you are .<endOfText>
<bot>Do you know  when they won the Eurovision Song Contest?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>

<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>They were.<endOfText>
<human>Waterloo  I was defeated you won the war .<endOfText>
<bot>Oh shit    Mark remembers.<endOfText>
<human>I remember watching that as well.<endOfText>
<bot>I can only just remember Bucks Fizz.<endOfText>
<human>That was a long time ago as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Cor yeah.<endOfText>
<human>You know what won them that?<endOfText>
<bot>It was when they fucking <endOfText>
<human>They was taking those skirts .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>And they whipped the the skirts off.<endOfText>
<human>Because they were both nice women weren't they?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Cheryl  Cheryl Baker and <endOfText>
<bot>Oh god<endOfText>
<human>the other one left didn't she?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Quite, quite a bit of disgrace actually cos she was having an affair with er the tour manager wasn't she?<endOfText>
<bot>Something like that.<endOfText>
<human>And they were both, weren't he married or something?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I thought she was the tasty one as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Cor yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Shorter but prettier.<endOfText>
<bot>Shelley Preston?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>That rings a bell.<endOfText>
<human>Shelley something.<endOfText>
<bot>Shelley certainly rings a bell.<endOfText>
<human>Excuse me.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah they went into an upbeat  time didn't they?<endOfText>
<human>They  ripped loads of people off.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Actually they  they were  quite good.<endOfText>
<bot>They weren't bad anyway.<endOfText>
<human>Oh I I would certainly reckon that was the best song on there for two or three years.<endOfText>
<bot>And, and after as well.<endOfText>
<human>Oh I don't know, there was some fucking  that that German one which won it, erm  what was her name?<endOfText>
<bot>Nina.<endOfText>
<human>Erm <endOfText>
<bot>Oh the one that sung in English and German and Spanish and French and Italian?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, right at the end.<endOfText>
<bot>That was fucking brilliant.<endOfText>
<human>I didn't like the song but I must admit I thought it was quite clever.<endOfText>
<bot>It was brilliant.<endOfText>
<human>That's the first time I've ever seen that done.<endOfText>
<bot>Or ever saw it done on the Eurovision.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah as I say I didn't like the song but I, that was well clever.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh I dunno, it got to number one.<endOfText>
<human>Europe wide didn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I know I still didn't like it.<endOfText>
<bot>It got to number one here.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah  I thought it was pretty good.<endOfText>
<bot>No, it wasn't really my cup of tea .<endOfText>
<human>But yeah it was well  she, what did she, she sung in English and German  Spanish and French<endOfText>
<bot>She went right round.<endOfText>
<human>She did the<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>the whole European countries.<endOfText>
<bot>I think she I think she did about eight or nine European countries didn't she?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I think the only one she missed was Turkish .<endOfText>
<human>Cos that  the year they won that was the first year that  what was it erm<endOfText>
<bot>Turkey hadn't finished last or something weren't it?<endOfText>
<human>No, who was it?<endOfText>
<bot>Finland got zero points.<endOfText>
<human>Oh that's right.<endOfText>
<bot>Finland yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Poor old Finland they never seemed to get many points did they?<endOfText>
<bot>The the the the trouble is  he got more recognition for that  for getting no points at all than he did probably if he'd have bloody won that thing.<endOfText>
<human>The the trouble is though their  their erm language just doesn't lend itself very well to pop music does it?<endOfText>
<bot>Well no they're  the thing is with the European  Song Contest  each different country has its own tendency, has its own leanings towards different types of material.<endOfText>
<human>I mean no  no  erm<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah and you're you're own judge can't vote for yourself can you?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>That's it.<endOfText>
<human>I mean <endOfText>
<bot>That's why matey never got any points.<endOfText>
<human>Cos nobody else liked Finland or something.<endOfText>
<bot>But didn't they get that, get that <endOfText>
<human>I mean they  y you <endOfText>
<bot>for two or three years though?<endOfText>
<human>You you think about, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Two or three times Finland got <endOfText>
<human>Three times on the trot.<endOfText>
<bot>Finland got no points.<endOfText>
<human>And it was the same bloke each time.<endOfText>
<bot>Was it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Was he the  was he the only singer- songwriter in the country or something then?<endOfText>
<human>Something like that.<endOfText>
<bot>That must have been the only man ever to get no points three times in a row.<endOfText>
<human>They have had some crap win it though.<endOfText>
<bot>Been a couple of good ones though.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Well there has been like <endOfText>
<human>Puppet on a Chain.<endOfText>
<bot>erm <endOfText>
<human>But who was that  Johnny Logan.<endOfText>
<bot>He was good.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>That was a nice song.<endOfText>
<human>We've won it a couple of times haven't we?<endOfText>
<bot>Won it about six times.<endOfText>
<human>Have we?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Didn't realize we'd won it that many.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  Bucks Fizz er <endOfText>
<human>The only ones, it was Petula Clark and Bucks Fizz the ones I know.<endOfText>
<bot>Eh?<endOfText>
<human>Petula Clark and Bucks Fizz are the ones I remember?<endOfText>
<bot>Petula Clark, Lulu.<endOfText>
<human>Erm <endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>Er<endOfText>
<bot>What did she sing?<endOfText>
<human>Oh god <endOfText>
<bot>Er  Mary Hopkins <endOfText>
<human>Is that what she sung?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm no no.<endOfText>
<human>Er Puppet on a String was er<endOfText>
<bot>No it was Petula Clark weren't it?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Mary Hopkins.<endOfText>
<human>Erm <endOfText>
<bot>Who sung what did Petula Clark sing?<endOfText>
<human>I can only remember those two.<endOfText>
<bot>Er   save all your kisses for  Brotherhood of Man.<endOfText>
<human>Brotherhood of Man yeah, that's true.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm <endOfText>
<human>That was a number one for years wasn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>What you done now Trev?<endOfText>
<human>Nothing.<endOfText>
<bot>He's just trying to take the grease out of his fingers.<endOfText>
<human>Erm erm erm erm erm erm erm  Cliff Richards won it once.<endOfText>
<bot>No, he was a professional though.<endOfText>
<human>He wou , which wouldn't be allowed to enter.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>It was.<endOfText>
<bot>Thought only non-professionals were allowed to enter?<endOfText>
<human>No, there's loads of them.<endOfText>
<bot>Really, as I said, really  <endOfText>
<human>Say hey girl take a walk on the wild side .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah but I thought in the case of like Petula Clark and Lulu it was  because they won it that got them into the  scene sort of thing.<endOfText>
<human>Certainly did for Bucks Fizz didn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>They <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>released an album on the strength of that song.<endOfText>
<human>Oh!<endOfText>
<bot>Fuck me, he is in.<endOfText>
<human>Course.<endOfText>
<bot>Ooh.<endOfText>
<human>Bloody hell.<endOfText>
<bot>Hallo Damian.<endOfText>
<human>How the devil are you?<endOfText>
<bot>Hallo mate.<endOfText>
<human>Not too bad.<endOfText>
<bot>How much is  did you have to pay extra on this?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I didn't get mine with Tech I didn't buy Technics .<endOfText>
<human>No?<endOfText>
<bot>They were eighty quid.<endOfText>
<human>Eighty quid are they?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Cos they're virtually the third best going anyway .<endOfText>
<bot>I I've heard quite good things .<endOfText>
<human>Sony.<endOfText>
<bot>I could have got but they were seventy quid.<endOfText>
<human>I didn't mind paying that sort of money but after spending so much on the Technics I couldn't afford another eighty quid  <endOfText>
<bot>You going home?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah I  I might go and treat myself to some today.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos they've got  see I don't know whether  I don't know whether it  makes it  Hemmings hey've got nought percent disc er interest and all that sort of stuff on every single thing<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>so I'm gonna see if they've got <endOfText>
<human>Cos you can pay it off in ten monthly instalments you see so  eight quid a month sort of thing.<endOfText>
<bot>No I might just go an see what sort of deal I can get.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos I've been meaning to get myself some.<endOfText>
<human>does it round about fifty quid.<endOfText>
<bot>But if you've got a decent Technics he said you want the best integrated<endOfText>
<human>Yeah I might, I mean I might I might go in   the best ones I can get.<endOfText>
<bot>Say I've got a .<endOfText>
<human>I'm not  I'm not overly fussed about this five C D carousel.<endOfText>
<bot>But it's good, don't get me wrong, it is well  well  but I  really don't think you need it.<endOfText>
<human>Cos I, I mean I tend to change my mind about  I'll be listening half way through a song and then get pissed  get pissed off with the album and go and <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah I know .<endOfText>
<human>change it.<endOfText>
<bot>And nine times out of, alright say I've got another four choices but nine times out of ten I'll go and  I will have put those four on, in the mood that I'm sort of feeling  then I'll fucking, I want to listen to something completely different.<endOfText>
<human>listen to The Jam I might want to go and listen to fucking  bit of heavy rock or something or  bit of pop or something you know?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>So  I don't think I've ever  I've had it for about eight months now and I don't think I've yet  listened to all five in a row  without changing it.<endOfText>
<bot>Mine's just the one C D.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>The only trouble is with that, if you're changing it for different albums all the time it can wear out the gears and that .<endOfText>
<human>That's the only trouble, cos I'm always changing the damn thing.<endOfText>
<bot>Well maybe it is a good thing, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Cos all I have to do is .<endOfText>
<bot>Cos you <endOfText>
<human>I I quite like the idea of these double ones you see  don't they?<endOfText>
<bot>What?<endOfText>
<human>The the double tray ones.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>My auntie's got one <endOfText>
<bot>Don't think Tech I think Pioneer do them don't they?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, and Sharp.<endOfText>
<bot>My auntie's got one  which takes six discs in a little box like that.<endOfText>
<human>It flips out  with six discs in it .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Which that is a good idea cos erm  if you get bored with one song or one album you just click it and it goes to that .<endOfText>
<bot>But I have to keep changing it.<endOfText>
<human>carousel as well <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>but like I said  nine times out of ten if I've got pissed off with an album I change all of them.<endOfText>
<bot>Just have a  and I I don't listen to that lot then.<endOfText>
<human>It's well flash though, it really is.<endOfText>
<bot>It's like I said you you can lift up the cover  and change four while one's playing.<endOfText>
<human>It's only the one that's got like the bit over the top of it.<endOfText>
<bot>What's this?<endOfText>
<human>A Technics carousel for the C D.<endOfText>
<bot>It's like five C D's in <endOfText>
<human>Two of me uncles have got  one  stacking system without the  put in a cassette or a cartridge type  allowed six.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And it just ch shoots one in.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I must admit I quite like these little mini systems, they're well powerful.<endOfText>
<bot>I can't stand them.<endOfText>
<human>Really?<endOfText>
<bot>I don't like them at all.<endOfText>
<human>Oh I think they're  quite good.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos I've got I've got <endOfText>
<human>There's no turntable though.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah I know, well  I haven't got a turntable with mine but  <endOfText>
<human>Do you remember Andy ?<endOfText>
<bot>Tubby, worked out there.<endOfText>
<human>He had about three thousand pounds worth of C D in his car.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>What, one of those ten  the one you put in the boot?<endOfText>
<bot>Fucking amazing it was.<endOfText>
<human>He'd say he'd give you <endOfText>
<bot>Gotta fill it up with ten C D's and you just got <endOfText>
<human>he give <endOfText>
<bot>like a little   pad in your car.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah he give  give me a booklet  and they get a little booklet with it.<endOfText>
<bot>And he'd say just take a look through  he said  just any one you want he said and I'll programme it that'll  come straight through and he sort of s six speakers  fucking ridiculous.<endOfText>
<human>What car did he have?<endOfText>
<bot>Only an A M .<endOfText>
<human>Citroen A, top of the range Citroen A M .<endOfText>
<bot>Cos I went to this kit car show and they had erm<endOfText>
<human>Absolutely fucking beautiful motor though.<endOfText>
<bot>anyway not unless  music coming out.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>I was gonna say cos if he's got that, that much it's probably more, more than the car's worth.<endOfText>
<human>They had this, they had this A T Cobra <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah it's about, no it's about fourteen fifteen grand <endOfText>
<human>kit car right?and they had, it was a V twelve jag  engine in it right?<endOfText>
<bot>Under the bonnet, and it was fucking, it was it was the best kit there.<endOfText>
<human>It won, it won the best kit car and this was at the national show so you imagine how good this thing was.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>And in the boot it had one of these things.<endOfText>
<bot>And all it's got, just on the little armrest was like a little pack like that.<endOfText>
<human>And it could programme everything on it, just in that pack, the radio and everything.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah?<endOfText>
<human>Fucking well .<endOfText>
<bot>And I saw  come just over the top of the doors as well.<endOfText>
<human>All nicely trimmed, oh it was immaculate, all chrome roll bars, chrome  bits at the front.<endOfText>
<bot>. Fucking good car.<endOfText>
<human>And he started it up  V twelve jag engine .<endOfText>
<bot>I nearly fucking  I was that excited with this car.<endOfText>
<human>It was fucking great.<endOfText>
<bot>But I mean if I had enough money to do it, like that's the kit I'd do.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos I've I've thought about a kit before but  for the money I've got I couldn't do what I really wanted.<endOfText>
<human>But if I had the money this is the car I'd do.<endOfText>
<bot>And I've  <endOfText>
<human>Well you've only got five pence so it don't allow you to fucking do  <endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>Doesn't even spend on the Airfix paint.<endOfText>
<bot>And I I thought the only ones I've ever seen and they've got like things like three eight and  Chevvy  or  maybe a V er  .<endOfText>
<human>And they're all nice engines  but there is nothing that will ever get anywhere near the V twelve .<endOfText>
<bot>They're just pure fucking power and it's it's  He'd sit there and vroom <endOfText>
<human>Bit like me really.<endOfText>
<bot>Just pure pure power.<endOfText>
<human>Been dreaming again boy.<endOfText>
<bot>No this was fucking .<endOfText>

<human>I mean we've got real upmarket programmes like Coronation Street.<endOfText>

<bot>Oh yes they do.<endOfText>
<human>At the end of the day old boy, at the end of the day <endOfText>
<bot>The only reason that I'm enjoying Neighbours again at the moment is that I haven't seen it for month and I'm trying to work out  which characters have changed, which characters are getting married to which other ones.<endOfText>

<human>The amount of crappy car accidents happening in that fucking Neighbours.<endOfText>
<bot>It must be the most  emotionally unstable province in the world, that.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah,.<endOfText>
<bot>Terri there's always divorces going on.<endOfText>
<human>Break ups in marriages, break up in boyfriends and girlfriends.<endOfText>

<human>unbelievable.<endOfText>
<bot>Fucking   plates.<endOfText>
<human>Do we need any  compound?<endOfText>
<bot>I haven't .<endOfText>
<human>I've got some mates with weird nicknames.<endOfText>
<bot>Really fucking weird nicknames.<endOfText>
<human>Chicky  One Hand Too  Digger <endOfText>
<bot>Digger.<endOfText>
<human>Digger.<endOfText>
<bot>He's Aussie is he?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Miner?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>that's his second name.<endOfText>
<human>Digger .<endOfText>
<bot>all three of them.<endOfText>
<human>There's three, three brothers  one's Big Digger, Little Digger and Dumper.<endOfText>
<bot>And then Little Digger got his nickname Chicky.<endOfText>
<human>Cos he fucking  he's a bit punky.<endOfText>
<bot>You know and he used to have one of these fucking mohicans, he  looked like fucking a fucking chicken.<endOfText>
<human>So he became Chicky.<endOfText>
<bot>Sounds like a right bunch.<endOfText>
<human>bunch of weirdos.<endOfText>
<bot>No, you'd get on alright with them Stuart.<endOfText>
<human>Thanks.<endOfText>
<bot>I think.<endOfText>
<human>I think about the only nicknames that  my mates have got  <endOfText>
<bot>Bunch of wankers?<endOfText>
<human>No one 's called either Tony or Malcolm the Mountie cos he looks like Tony Slattery.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah?<endOfText>
<human>He really does.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh!<endOfText>
<human>That's where he first came to fame wasn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>The mountie <endOfText>
<human>Malcolm the mountie, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah  <endOfText>
<human>He looks like the spitting image of him I tell you.<endOfText>
<bot>He really does.<endOfText>
<human>So it, he either gets called Tony or Malcolm Mountie.<endOfText>
<bot>We've got this erm  I actually don't know why he's got this nickname  but there's this guy who lives out in  er  and he's got the nickname  Seamus O'Reilly.<endOfText>
<human>You have to do that, it's Seamus O Seamus, how are you doing Seamus?<endOfText>
<bot>And  I don't think I could tell you how he got his nickname.<endOfText>
<human>Cos I don't think he's got anything to do with Ireland or anything.<endOfText>
<bot>There's a couple of mates of mine  Obey.<endOfText>
<human>Robert  his nick <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>name was and he's called Obey or Bod.<endOfText>
<bot>Everybody called him Bod.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Like the oth <endOfText>
<human>Martin <endOfText>
<bot>There's this other two  and erm  they're brothers and they're both  they're both quite big.<endOfText>
<human>Sort of not fat <endOfText>
<bot>but quite well built and all that.<endOfText>
<human>And they've both got slicked back hair.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And they look like the fucking The Management.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh .<endOfText>
<human>So we don't call them what we, we call them Ronnie and Reggie.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah?<endOfText>
<human>After the Krays.<endOfText>
<bot>We started calling them Ronnie but it got a bit confusing.<endOfText>
<human>And out of those four  out, well out of the the bunch I know  that's the only four that have got nicknames, that we actually use all the time.<endOfText>
<bot>Winkle.<endOfText>
<human>Ravi  used to be.<endOfText>
<bot>Winkle was the classic.<endOfText>
<human>went to call someone a wanker <endOfText>
<bot>Wanker it come out winker .<endOfText>
<human>That's it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah you tell me these things.<endOfText>
<human>Fucking winker.<endOfText>
<bot>I've  I've had quite a few nicknames.<endOfText>
<human>Think you should fuck off.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos I think you should fuck off.<endOfText>
<human>Do you like your face the way it is or not?<endOfText>
<bot>Not particularly, but you ain't gonna do nothing about it.<endOfText>
<human>We don't like it the way it is.<endOfText>
<bot>Can you arrange something?<endOfText>
<human>facial attribute <endOfText>
<bot>squeezing a fucking zit.<endOfText>
<human>Why don't you fucking squeeze that spot on the top of your shoulders?<endOfText>
<bot>Ha ha ha.<endOfText>
<human>You got overtime ?<endOfText>
<bot>Course not.<endOfText>
<human>Don't be silly.<endOfText>
<bot>We haven't had overtime for the last couple of weeks.<endOfText>
<human>Saturday <endOfText>
<bot>You sure you can't get that finger any further up there?<endOfText>
<human>Look at that, right up to the elbow he's got that finger up his nose.<endOfText>
<bot>Flipping hell.<endOfText>
<human>Ask me what?<endOfText>
<bot>Ah, you're as bad as Tim.<endOfText>
<human>. Tim ought to be able to do it .<endOfText>
<bot>listen to yourself.<endOfText>
<human>Don't worry about it.<endOfText>
<bot>talking to two blokes here.<endOfText>
<human>I worry about you <endOfText>
<bot>I'm not talking to Sue, I'm talking to you.<endOfText>
<human>I've not said a word against <endOfText>
<bot>Well how come you're getting shoved after five years experience?<endOfText>
<human>first  first few days you got involved with too many foremen.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>You have, cos you've been lippy.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  first few days<endOfText>
<human>You don't get on with your work.<endOfText>
<bot>First two days .<endOfText>
<human>First two days he came up here <endOfText>
<bot>I know you had that  unfortunate incident<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>about two or three days after being here.<endOfText>
<human>Well somebody  in the office.<endOfText>
<bot>The thing is, you haven't had a brilliant  neither of you two have had a brilliant reputation for a long time, right?<endOfText>
<human>Now he's, he's done nothing<endOfText>
<bot>he's done nothing, put it right for the last year.<endOfText>
<human>As probably so have you.<endOfText>
<bot>But it takes a lot longer than a year to get rid of a bad reputation.<endOfText>
<human>Elvis.<endOfText>
<bot>Is anybody  .<endOfText>
<human>Eh?<endOfText>
<bot>Don't worry about me I'm singing mate.<endOfText>
<human>yeah, he knows the score.<endOfText>
<bot>Trying to get the time to go a bit faster.<endOfText>
<human>Eh?<endOfText>
<bot>I thought you were moaning.<endOfText>
<human>No, I was singing.<endOfText>
<bot>Half four.<endOfText>
<human>Half four.<endOfText>
<bot>And some of us keep to our contracts.<endOfText>
<human>Do they?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Says who?<endOfText>
<bot>Me.<endOfText>
<human>Fucking company don't does it?<endOfText>
<bot>Well go home at half five then.<endOfText>
<human>No, I'll go home when I'm ready.<endOfText>
<bot>Three hours.<endOfText>
<human>They're not giving us four hours are they?<endOfText>
<bot>They ain't keeping to their part of the contract.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, you can fucking sue them.<endOfText>
<bot>I know.<endOfText>
<human>Cos they keep telling  cos I owe them so many hours  they keep coming up to me and telling me  that I owe them so many hours, you signed the contract saying you've got  whatever happens .<endOfText>
<bot>Now they're not giving us the time to make .<endOfText>
<human>They're breaking their part of the contract now.<endOfText>
<bot>we've gotta  thirty nine hour week.<endOfText>
<human>You've gotta do a thirty nine hour week?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I do three hours overtime.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So  we do three so we only get paid for thirty nine hours a week instead of forty.<endOfText>
<human>All I know  even when I first  even when I first got here and I was working  <endOfText>
<bot>And if I have  two weeks time  then we get paid er  thirty six hour .<endOfText>
<human>Go to erm  the C A B <endOfText>
<bot>No, I only found out this morning didn't I?<endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah <endOfText>
<bot>She'll probably go to a  Citizen's Advice Bureau.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>See what's going on, see what she can do about it.<endOfText>
<human>One of her mates over the road's  he's gonna try and get a grant  and then pay for the college by that and then tell  where to go with his overtime.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And that's the best way of dealing with it really isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Still a bit cuntish.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I don't see why we should have to<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>Ryan, Ryan was doing four hours on the Saturday morning to make up his time, right?<endOfText>
<bot>You get  you officially get should get paid time and a half on Saturday morning.<endOfText>
<human>Half, yeah on Saturday yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So you are doing six hours to make up the four.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Well I never did it on a Saturday.<endOfText>
<human>I did it during the week and came in on a Saturday for myself.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh see what she does.<endOfText>
<human>She'll sort something out for me.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Cos I've already sussed Jim out anyway cos  he said it was on my contract saying I had to do the four hours.<endOfText>
<bot>Well I've got my contract out and it's totally different to his and any other apprentices.<endOfText>
<human>I've just got another bit of paper  a note saying  please note  while you are at college you are asked to do four hours overtime and that's not a contract, it's just a letter.<endOfText>
<bot>So if I wanted to I could tell them where to go with that and all.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But get it sorted out.<endOfText>
<human>Go, get your mum or somebody to  get all your paperwork together and go to the C A B.<endOfText>
<bot>Because it sounds as if they're having you one over the barrel.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>It was on a programme the other night saying the advice bureau are on the er   companies cos some bloke, they were employing him to do something  and he sued them and got two grand out of them.<endOfText>
<human>They fined him for doing something stupid <endOfText>
<bot>I think the ideal thing is she can't  you can't do that.<endOfText>
<human>But any  any one of us in here now who were  who were actually training  and have finished our time, no no apprentices were  to become part of the union.<endOfText>
<bot>Even if you're in a non-union company, they will fight for you if they think you've got a case.<endOfText>
<human>If you've got a good case, then they'll put their lawyers on to it.<endOfText>
<bot>But that's only if you are actually part of the union.<endOfText>
<human>Er paying subs.<endOfText>
<bot>So  probably be a good idea, even if you're  not in a union company to to actually join a union .<endOfText>
<human>Whether it's rightly deserved or not ain't the point.<endOfText>
<bot>a bad reputation.<endOfText>
<human>So if they made me redundant  or whatever I know all the ins and outs.<endOfText>
<bot>John  's fucked off in the afternoon to a car auction.<endOfText>
<human>Old Bob came over <endOfText>
<bot>it doesn't matter whether the er reputation's deserved or not <endOfText>
<human>You ask Barry.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean he  he knows you've changed.<endOfText>
<human>He knows <endOfText>
<bot>What time is it chaps?<endOfText>
<human>Please<endOfText>
<bot>It's four o'clock.<endOfText>
<human>erm when you lot  out there first of all   wasn't there?moved on.<endOfText>
<bot>I came in, and I was still in here <endOfText>
<human>Yeah but you  you weren't, you weren't really put on <endOfText>
<bot>No he goes  he goes to me  he goes  <endOfText>
<human>Oh no you weren't were you?<endOfText>
<bot>It was me and Jamesy and Graham weren't it?<endOfText>
<human>He goes er  <endOfText>
<bot>I think  I think a lot of people agree  but I think a lot of people would probably say that  .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>No, but I tell you what  that, as soon as you two were separated<endOfText>
<human>When, when you went out there with us.<endOfText>
<bot>You both started knuckling down.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah you did.<endOfText>
<bot>We weren't knuckling down but we started working more because we weren't fucking bossed about.<endOfText>
<human>You  you and<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah that was  though.<endOfText>
<human>and then you  you got separated and both fucking started working<endOfText>
<bot>It's a lot harder  it's a lot harder to get rid of a bad reputation .<endOfText>
<human>I know that cos I had to work at it when I first come here<endOfText>
<bot>fucking know it all attitude.<endOfText>
<human>Bit like me now.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah!<endOfText>
<human>Because I done extra metal work  for three years right?<endOfText>
<bot>And  metal work  two years before that.<endOfText>
<human>And I thought there ain't nothing these blokes can teach me about files and stuff.<endOfText>
<bot>Right?<endOfText>
<human>And a lot of the time they couldn't teach me anything.<endOfText>
<bot>I'd been doing it for five years.<endOfText>
<human>But obviously I'd got on to something a bit more skilled and I still had this know all attitude.<endOfText>
<bot>And I I got right  few bollockings.<endOfText>
<human>I had fucking verbal warnings and all sorts.<endOfText>
<bot>And I tell you what, it took me probably another couple of years to get out of that.<endOfText>
<human>Verbal, written.<endOfText>
<bot>I've had none of that since <endOfText>
<human>I had a fucking verbal already.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I got verbals.<endOfText>
<human>Cos he get, he said  old man<endOfText>
<bot>Who's that, Mark?<endOfText>
<human>Mark, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>And<endOfText>
<human>.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos I hadn't done nothing.<endOfText>
<human>I said what the  does your old man .<endOfText>
<bot>I dunno whether he actually tells him he's fucking off  or what, but I think he knows he<endOfText>
<human>That's what pissed me off, when you lot got moved down there  fucking  ridiculous.<endOfText>
<bot>and they were added on after.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah I know, that's why.<endOfText>
<bot>When we first went out there there was no trainees and then all of a sudden we got  no, who did we get?<endOfText>
<human>because it was the same time.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos we got Brian didn't we?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>out there  come back in here.<endOfText>
<human>Can't remember.<endOfText>
<bot>I think he's just a fucking arsehole  to get sent  get himself out there.<endOfText>
<human>Cos that that's what Tim and  especially Richard was fucking well upset about.<endOfText>
<bot>He only went out there to help  some <endOfText>
<human>Good luck to the bloke.<endOfText>
<bot>I haven't seen it.<endOfText>
<human>Still got .<endOfText>
<bot>way to get on innit?<endOfText>
<human>Basically  you've gotta be a yes man.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm not a yes man.<endOfText>
<human>At the end of the day you'll flatly refuse to do a job if you don't like it.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll just say I don't like it, I'll go and do it.<endOfText>
<human>.<endOfText>
<bot>Fuck it, I'm ill.<endOfText>
<human>Well this is the thing I can't understand, especially Mark and that.<endOfText>
<bot>Why you lot can't .<endOfText>
<human>It looks better on your record than being made redundant <endOfText>
<bot>No, you'll still get sacked.<endOfText>
<human>You can get sacked for fucking  <endOfText>
<bot>I know, I'm not, that's what I'm saying.<endOfText>
<human>Specially Mark and  oh really taking the piss.<endOfText>
<bot>just fucking  for three hours.<endOfText>
<human>Well he's gonna struggle to get  get a job anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>He he's gonna struggle to get a job anyway let alone <endOfText>
<human>I asked Derek if he'll give me a reference  said yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>really but <endOfText>
<human>Well Derek'll give you the right one won't he?<endOfText>
<bot>Will it help Barry if if I can use the same  to actually ask him if ?<endOfText>
<human>C V and photo photocopy it or something.<endOfText>
<bot>Or would it just  will it just be the same as writing down your name and .<endOfText>
<human>That's it, if Derek said I could use his name for a reference  <endOfText>
<bot>Er <endOfText>
<human>I dunno  I I mean I have never actually had a written reference from anybody when I've left <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah I mean you used to do that  I mean <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, the old days.<endOfText>
<bot>I got a written reference from m m m <endOfText>
<human>In the old days  no no I mean you <endOfText>

<human>Happy ever after   young lover!is he weird !<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah I said to her I wa wanna waste a film and I couldn't think of anybody better to waste it on.<endOfText>
<human>Then I realised what I was saying, and it sort of realised that it wasn't really a a complimentary thing to say to her.<endOfText>
<bot>No it wasn't.<endOfText>
<human>That was after she hit me!<endOfText>
<bot>a couple of them in there.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, yes, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>A couple of her cats   friends down last night so she wasted a couple on them.<endOfText>
<human>Played this game called Snog.<endOfText>
<bot>The what?<endOfText>
<human>Dog?<endOfText>
<bot>Alsatian's .<endOfText>
<human>Snog yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I can't remember how you get there, I can't remember how cards is how many cards it is, but you get loads of cards, with with pictures of different things you have to kiss and it ranges from the hand at one point, navel six points, bottom seven, lips eight points, cheek three points, erm the chest fifteen points and there's a fig leaf one fig leaf bud in there, fifteen points and you can kiss anything you like.<endOfText>
<human>Oh right yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Right and there's also, what it is, is there's also a few cards just with snog on.<endOfText>
<human>And when you that lay down you can look at whoever what the other players have got face up and you either go for a player  or you go for the maximum points.<endOfText>
<bot>But you've gotta try and get the most points to win the game.<endOfText>
<human>And you pick you one you want to kiss and you have to kiss them on whatever their card is showing.<endOfText>
<bot>And then if if you lay down the joker cards you have to kiss everybody.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>There was erm me, Karen, her flatmate and her flatmate's boyfriend.<endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Playing this game last night till three o'clock in the morning.<endOfText>
<human>Quite a laugh.<endOfText>
<bot>I won three games  in a row !<endOfText>
<human>Yeah?<endOfText>
<bot>Cos I'd kiss anything!<endOfText>
<human>I'd had a few !<endOfText>
<bot>Don't sound like a lot <endOfText>
<human>.<endOfText>
<bot>Wha Eh?<endOfText>
<human>I always get something wrong, I always   I kept, I kept getting to kiss her flatmate's chest.<endOfText>
<bot>And I was only doing up here but er, that's good enough, sort of thing I kissed her on the lips a couple <endOfText>
<human>, was everywhere <endOfText>
<bot>of times  kissed her on the arse <endOfText>
<human>a couple of times, great!<endOfText>
<bot>Eh?<endOfText>
<human>She kissed me on the arse a couple of times, kissed me on the navel a couple of times.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>But somehow, I me and this other bloke managed to avoid each other.<endOfText>
<bot>Aha.<endOfText>
<human>I think he laid a joker card and I had a hand card up, so he had to do a kiss my hand.<endOfText>
<bot>And so you get a dice.<endOfText>
<human>Well and it's the normal one to six dice and all that whatever the dice shows you times it by five seconds like.<endOfText>
<bot>One one dot of the dice, five seconds, six, thirty seconds, yeah?<endOfText>
<human>And he he got he got my hand for five seconds and then I I got  I got his hand for ten something like that.<endOfText>
<bot>The rest of the time we managed to avoid each other it's good.<endOfText>
<human>Sounds like a good game.<endOfText>
<bot>It's quite good if you  well  we were quite well away, but nobody was really jealous of each other and that.<endOfText>
<human>Certainly be a good game if you know people, you're not  .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah have you ever played er spin the bottle?<endOfText>
<human>Used to play that at parties.<endOfText>
<bot>You gotta have a go at strip poker though  Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>But the thing is we were all really  I mean thing I'd we've all nearly in a state of undress anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah it's about ten of us at this party put the bottle in the middle and spin it and whoever the the open ends comes at is the the previous spinner's gotta kiss that .<endOfText>
<human>didn't play.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Well then I I fucking spun this bottle.<endOfText>
<bot>I got the tastiest bird in the place  and all that and er she spun it and spun it back to me and  spun it.<endOfText>
<human>and he's he's a bit younger than me and I've gone come on then give us a kiss, like this, and he's gone like that, I thought, just there like this  and I've leant over and went just there.<endOfText>
<bot>And he's he's turned over this and just gonna slap one on me and I've turned my head and gone like that  and he's fucking caught me right on the fucking lips  !<endOfText>
<human>A real cracker!<endOfText>
<bot>So funny!<endOfText>
<human>Fucking hilarious!<endOfText>
<bot>He wet himself!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>He went, oh you dirty bastard!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah if you if there's some broad-minded adults there.<endOfText>
<bot>But if you're really pissed, you don't care about them do you, eh?<endOfText>
<human>No that's right.<endOfText>
<bot>Everybody wet themselves!<endOfText>
<human>You dirty bastard!<endOfText>
<bot>Nice !<endOfText>
<human>Susan  trying to kiss me on the arse right and I fucking farted!<endOfText>
<bot>Urgh !<endOfText>
<human>She said you dirty animal  fucking git!<endOfText>
<bot>She got me she had to kiss me on the arse  she fucking she had to be there thirty seconds to get the points and I farted at about ten seconds<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>And we wouldn't let her have the points till she came back and finished the other twenty.<endOfText>
<human>Quite a funny game.<endOfText>
<bot>There's this thing called sex maniacs.<endOfText>
<human>Sex maniacs version of Trivial Pursuit.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Like erm  can't remember them erm.<endOfText>

<human>Sometimes there's just the totally outrageous funny answers to, sort of, some of the questions, sometimes they're  similar  and it's like verversity woman's preference for mens clothes.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm there's all stuff like that you know, there's famous things you know.<endOfText>
<human>Who said who said sex is just five minutes of squelching?<endOfText>
<bot>Is it A, Sid Vicious, B, Johnny Rotten, or C er Malcolm Maclaren, and apparently it was Johnny Rotten.<endOfText>
<human>Stuff like that, it's quite funny.<endOfText>
<bot>What you gotta do is, each card, if you they ar the person in front of you asks the co the question and if you get it right you get that card and each card has got a letter on it and you gotta try and make up sex maniac.<endOfText>
<human>Oh I see, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But you can't can't throw any away until you've got ten and then you can throw one away.<endOfText>
<human>And also in there there's like, there's there's the odd card saying swap your entire hand with somebody to the left or the right of you, or swap a card with the person on the left or the right of you, and that's quite funny for a laugh as well.<endOfText>

<bot>Who was that, who was <endOfText>
<human>nine times out of ten these <endOfText>
<bot>It's just body work<endOfText>
<human>Well the  engine erm between cars<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, the  got to actually change the  starter motor erm  I mean on the A D fifties and the two litre they  I would sort of, its only a hundred and fifty cc, but the next biggest thing they did was stopping er, a sixteen hundred  so  quite a lot of those, but nine times out of ten all they did was  another part, so<endOfText>
<human>I, I, actually heard that the R S two thousand were, were quite reliable out of most of the sports car, but they did, did have to buy a  they were quite expensive, same as  top of the range car and their, their top of the range of car was  parts of them, especially if they, they, they stopped making them in  <endOfText>
<bot>Same as a Herald <endOfText>
<human>eleven year old <endOfText>
<bot>a Herald was <endOfText>
<human>funnily enough because they made so many fucking Herald's, you can get parts for them really easy, I mean Dolomite fifteen, thirteen's, eighteen fifty you can get no problem, any part you want, no problem, but  cos its a quick car, people have either fucking killed them or<endOfText>
<bot>crashed them <endOfText>
<human>they've crashed them, they didn't make many of them.<endOfText>
<bot>Frankly, I couldn't afford the fees<endOfText>
<human>No <endOfText>
<bot>whatever I get from this  there's gonna be <endOfText>
<human>Fucking garage <endOfText>
<bot>there's gonna be a big park and, and<endOfText>
<human>In who's garage?<endOfText>
<bot>at your garage.<endOfText>
<human>Haven't got a  your old man said,<endOfText>
<bot>old man's in there.<endOfText>
<human>What <endOfText>
<bot>I mean we've got, four, four, four cars in our house, the gran lives in the granny annexe inside, god knows how the fucking hell she got a  parking space, somehow she did, mum's got her's in there, my old mans parked his opposite, we've got a big double drive as well, my old man parks his on the right and I park mine on the fucking left, its like a parking lot out there in the mornings, and if when he says <endOfText>
<human>When, when your brother <endOfText>
<bot>yeah, he <endOfText>
<human>he start driving <endOfText>
<bot>hasn't started driving yet, but if for instance, erm, I've left my car out, just left it in, in the way, cos nobody  nobody said they were gonna go out and all of a sudden they wanna go out before I get up or something, fucking this cars reversing here, fucking everywhere, but that, and that <endOfText>
<human>still got a  outside me house<endOfText>
<bot>its as bad as our house , I say the secret in our house drove cars is three cars parked out the front,so you've got a bit of grass, three cars parked there, you're not allowed to park on the dri , drive,,sometimes  parking round the front, but <endOfText>
<human>The other thing is, I mean, whatever I get back  its gonna be a big part of my spending money, so if I don't stay <endOfText>
<bot>see it in there?<endOfText>
<human>in the paper today, it should be, so if I don't get any, put it this way if I don't sell it before Christmas <endOfText>
<bot>Well you've still got that two grand of whatever<endOfText>
<human>yeah, that's what I'll do, I'll just take some out of that and replace, but I, I've said, I, I'm never gonna touch that I'll be well unhappy if I do, cos I been in real dodgy situations with money and still resisted the temptation to take, touch that money.<endOfText>

<human>I've, I've never seen it , well I've, I've, I've only had contact, I've had these, this last set of contacts for about two years now, that's why I want to get some new ones and erm <endOfText>
<bot>How much are they nowadays?<endOfText>
<human>Tint, tinted ones , there's coloured ones, there's all sorts<endOfText>

<human>Those, those ones are complete cover over, just got the <endOfText>
<bot>No, this is one to re-cover over<endOfText>
<human>Yeah I would of thought<endOfText>
<bot>yeah<endOfText>
<human>you can only get re-cover overs<endOfText>
<bot>No, I went for contact lenses, he, he just said look, there are lots of ones on the, the market, but I suggest you have these, bloody shape of them,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah you get, you get, blue ones which make your eyes bluer than <endOfText>
<bot>You can get ones that implant sort of colours<endOfText>
<human>Yeah<endOfText>
<bot>actually when I think  my eyes, my eyes go dark green, fucking  they're almost like translucent green  cos the  are all fucking <endOfText>
<human>walk into a shop and the girl, the girl goes oh you look tired, you think, yeah, yeah, you know, still fucking red you know, that's what I  <endOfText>
<bot>I don't get red , I've never have done  I, its only sort of over the past sort of half year, and I don't know why, they never started, started to go red <endOfText>
<human>Did they <endOfText>
<bot>when they <endOfText>
<human>You're supposed to change you contacts at least once a year<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah<endOfText>
<human>er, apparently after that you can start risking infection, and they get hard and everything, that's what I've noticed<endOfText>
<bot>My, My  <endOfText>
<human>get mine in now <endOfText>
<bot>my aunty gets, gets them back and she says they come back, she, she actually  them, and she, she cuts them into the, the shape, of the<endOfText>
<human>Iris<endOfText>
<bot>yeah, and er, she gets them back and er they've got to go through about twenty different processes before they're allowed out the shop, or out the  storage, cos even then, when they're in store, they're, they're, some of them come back as  cracked, you get ones coming back from er customers sort of thing, been  and they come back and they've got pins in them, they've got bloody great er bits on the outside,of the outside .<endOfText>
<human>I've got the like  I don't know what it is, they've got like the little triangular something on one of the things, its right on the edge of the  like a little white mark on it, that's <endOfText>
<bot>I, I get it sometimes, I, I tell you what<endOfText>
<human>I can't get it off, I've soaked it in , yeah <endOfText>
<bot>if, if you go for a swim right, and you  with your contact lenses in, I always wear my goggles over the top, I mean obviously if you dive<endOfText>
<human>yeah<endOfText>
<bot>and you open your eyes, you miss the, the contact  right, but always  and er, it  so you take them straight out, and you've got to clean them virtually straight <endOfText>
<human>Well I swim with mine in and I haven't noticed anything <endOfText>
<bot>I don't know, maybe its just me <endOfText>
<human>Well you are a bit drunk  <endOfText>
<bot>if you happen to get anything in your eye, right  the, the thing I found was, if you just close your eye and then open it again, your contact lens would come up with your <endOfText>
<human>No, I've never had a problem like that <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah<endOfText>
<human>You see, I didn't realise I thought there was a soft or hard, but there's actually soft and then there's <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>allow  and they reckon that soft ones are better suited too sports because, because of the great  action they're harder to, to knock out, whereas soft ones er, have better other qualities, I've got this little fucking book, book that I picked up in the Boots in Farnborough the other day  yes, its quite interesting.<endOfText>
<bot>Hard ones have better greater durability and that er vision  and that's it, all the others is, is fair <endOfText>
<human>I don't know, I say I found my ones brilliant  they are <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but , but I'm just saying they reckon on this, its like, they had a little chart, its either fair, good or excellent and like all the others there was like vision and wear and stuff and the vision of  that erm, durability and vision capabilities were excellent on the, on the erm<endOfText>
<human>Hard ones<endOfText>
<bot>hard ones, yes, and just good on the  and soft ones.<endOfText>
<human>but if you think about it, there is the hard ones can have a lot better  can't they, I mean the only thing that'll actually harm them is that if you  get poked in the eye or something and it shatters the lens cos they are actually  <endOfText>
<bot>you can now get non shatter proof car lenses, shatter <endOfText>
<human>Shatter <endOfText>
<bot>shatter proof car lenses<endOfText>
<human>non shatter proof.<endOfText>
<bot>non shatter proof, whatever, non shatter I think they say <endOfText>

<bot>the bonny, bonny  of the  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah<endOfText>
<bot>Fucking,<endOfText>
<human>Worse one I had was to go and get some elbow grease.<endOfText>
<bot>this guy Jim <endOfText>
<human>I nearly  like that  he was like a .<endOfText>
<bot>I did fucking, I did five years of normal paperwork and plus for the last three years I did double as well cos I got kicked out of french, so I was  in metal work like, four hours of metal work every week the last three  three years and, cos I was like nine times out of ten I was the only bloke there, the er, the er metal work teacher got on really well, he was  showing me all sorts of stuff and I never got to do the actual metal work lesson<endOfText>
<human>well nine times out of ten yes, everybody else was in french lesson.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>yeah,<endOfText>
<bot>This is why I had the right attitude when I first got to British Aerospace,anybody any, any  anything anybody could tell me about how to fucking  like that<endOfText>
<human>Yeah<endOfText>
<bot>cos I had a right old attitude, I mean, I mean, I know it sounds modest, but, I was doing it well, don't get me wrong, I was doing it, and I, but then it started getting a bit <endOfText>
<human>Sort of <endOfText>
<bot>a bit too advanced , stuff that I never got and all of a sudden I was still saying I could do it and I couldn't any more so I, took me ages to get rid of that reputation cos why I know about  you see, I forgotten what  fucking hard too get rid of it<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, even  get rid of it <endOfText>
<bot>too bad <endOfText>
<human>With us,need, need a bit of a mouthy <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Dave<endOfText>
<bot>I wasn't saying oh I know it all, you can't tell me  how to  superior attitude<endOfText>
<human>Yeah<endOfText>
<bot>fucking wasting my time  six months.<endOfText>
<human>the bastards.<endOfText>
<bot>But the fact is I have done it all, up till about the first six months there and then I started getting  well, well out of my league, you start getting the machining and stuff like that, I haven't done much on them at all.<endOfText>
<human>But I still, no I was still saying oh yeah I can do this, getting in a right old state  boys will be boys.<endOfText>
<bot>I wanted to be a machining  but I was .<endOfText>
<human>That was probably  the most, the in , the most interesting form  friendship in there,its fucking good, I went for a job in there, but I couldn't I was an apprentice , as I say that, that's what got me going really was the fact that he had to go down and actually  do a design of the  and he had to work on the <endOfText>
<bot>I think that's technically a, a draughtsman though is it, that's more like a  more what we call a design commission.<endOfText>
<human>Something like that, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But everybody get it,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah<endOfText>
<bot>every , but all, all the draughtsman unless they were just called <endOfText>
<human>We always used to play the  like you never see what is going on and never know the problems involved in being , that, that was what was good about the, the R A interview .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but they're, they're much more keyed up  probably their design programme is probably much more advanced than most other places  <endOfText>
<human>The whole idea originally is the R A was to get them  we can design as well <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah<endOfText>
<human>so I mean though, I suppose that they probably had erm things they <endOfText>
<bot>The, the most efficient wing in the world is seven hundred mile an hour, it, it was a flying pig at, at seven hundred and thirty.<endOfText>
<human>Ah, ah, sorry?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, like I said what's, what's the people's most efficient wing in the world, seven hundred mile that could be a flying pig, but why all of a sudden technology started  in.<endOfText>
<bot>See I don't really know much about planes to be honest with you.<endOfText>
<human>There, there is planes, but there is no want  the, the world's most efficient because like I said that the efficiency changes at different, different level <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah <endOfText>
<human>speeds, altitudes, stuff like that.<endOfText>
<bot>See some  different characteristics and a supersonic  and so that then, so the elevator and control services because at supersonic speeds, if you moved at the same distance, at  six hundred mile an hour the elevator went like that, so that sort of <endOfText>
<human>you're not fucking throwing the plane out of control or the elevator would rip off or something, I mean if you get the same sort of thing probably would only have to do that, break the surface a little bit.<endOfText>
<bot>The, we <endOfText>
<human>Think how much like <endOfText>
<bot>we did two years theory as well, no three years theory  <endOfText>
<human>There's a, there's a lot of dead people not dead cos their dead because they've died of old age, dead because they were trying to find out how things work.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah<endOfText>
<human>We  flying a glider or throw themselves of the bridge, if it doesn't work they die, somebody learns from that, you know, I know it, it really was a fucking <endOfText>
<bot>this, this has been the most extreme  of trial and error ever<endOfText>
<human>Let's face it a war is the, the biggest single event that can increase technology  in the electronics and radars  two men on a fucking single budget, two men on something like a three hundred pound a year budget or something silly.<endOfText>
<bot>Like behind us, up behind where I live at Sandhurst  thirty years now.<endOfText>
<human>The prin I mean the principal of radar that's fucking  fascinating, the did a programme on it,<endOfText>
<bot>That's, that's where they go on <endOfText>
<human>and the first sort of thing they ever had was just like a little screen it just went blip and that's it, all they could tell you was there was something in their vicinity, it couldn't tell you what direction it was or what height or anything.<endOfText>
<bot>That was developed up at  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah , and then from that they've now got these fucking things that show the direction, the sign, the speed and oh  its incredible   sonar's been going longer than radar, but only just  we were the world leader's now, I mean we  cos we, cos we preserve fuel, we knew exactly, they left it for the last minute to get up there and intercept them.<endOfText>
<bot>That's right all of a sudden they're <endOfText>
<human>They reckon Germany done about ten, fifteen minutes combat time over the, over the <endOfText>
<bot>only once who had any staying power with a high <endOfText>
<human>But then again they were no match to .<endOfText>
<bot>I mean we, we say the .<endOfText>
<human>In nineteen thirty there was something like  there was only about er ninety, hundred spitfires in the Battle of Britain all the rest were fucking Hurricane's and stuff <endOfText>
<bot>Do they still do that?<endOfText>
<human>No, that's been cut out, same as the blue ribbon  crossing the Atlantic  blue ribbon event.<endOfText>
<bot>Even though, even though er thingy  trying to do ain't they?<endOfText>
<human>The last, the last, the last liner oh yeah, the last liner to actually do it is erm the Queen Mary's<endOfText>
<bot>say the Queen Mary <endOfText>
<human>I mean the Queen Elizabeth, Q E two never even went into that   like an average steamer, thirty five knots or something<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah<endOfText>
<human>that's fucking going some for a ship that size  I would love to have be able to fly with the  or something<endOfText>
<bot>yeah<endOfText>
<human>cos that really was flying you know, that was, no, it was none of this fucking press a button and let the, just a computer do it, you're a computer technician, you're a pilot now, but this fucking Eddy, Eddy the , yeah real, there's, there's quite a few reputable<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah<endOfText>
<human>but there's only one real <endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes the shame like that  <endOfText>
<human>as well <endOfText>
<bot>there's only one Lancaster still flying, and there's no Wellington and<endOfText>
<human>Well there are, if you go<endOfText>
<bot>there's no Wellington's<endOfText>
<human>if you go to Hamdon<endOfText>
<bot>there aren't any original Wellington's flying because this is why they got <endOfText>
<human>Oh no, not flying ,<endOfText>
<bot>no, oh yeah <endOfText>
<human>cos they  <endOfText>
<bot>its like lots of  as well but  this is why <endOfText>
<human>Its only <endOfText>
<bot>this is why they were so excited about this one they found in the Lock, in the, in er Loch Ness, because it was in such superb condition and they actually reckon they can get it flying again.<endOfText>
<human>its only one short  as well Look at all the, look at all the Brian .<endOfText>
<bot>called defiance, ever heard of that then?<endOfText>
<human>There's only three, yeah three they reckon left in the world and they found one with a Japanese <endOfText>
<bot>are still  quite, quite around a lot, there's not many of them, there are about fifteen, twenty, there's not that many P fifty one Mustang's either  crying shame in it?<endOfText>
<human>twenty-five  bombers.<endOfText>
<bot>There's quite a few of them, cos they were <endOfText>
<human>Yeah <endOfText>
<bot>they the by erm old air America in the early indo China wars.<endOfText>
<human>They're quite, they're quite common actually, I mean there was a couple up at Black Wood<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah,<endOfText>
<human>the only ones left in this country<endOfText>
<bot>they've erm,erm fifty-eight's up at Black Bridge, they used to be three of them there and, one of them was used in the<endOfText>
<human>plane<endOfText>
<bot>one of them was used in the er  film, no er, what's the Richard Burton er Clint Eastwood film?<endOfText>
<human>Where Eagles Dare<endOfText>
<bot>Where Eagles Dare, erm their flying the <endOfText>
<human>See I, I didn't eith I didn't either realise, right <endOfText>
<bot>That was just, that was Blackbush <endOfText>
<human>that helicopter's were fucking around during the second World War but they, they were <endOfText>
<bot>I think the first, the first helicopter flight was thirty seven weren't they?<endOfText>
<human>No, the first V T O <endOfText>
<bot>Flying  <endOfText>
<human>yeah, the first V T O L, no thirty-five<endOfText>
<bot>thirty-five, I think its sort of thirty-six  <endOfText>
<human>that was  V T O L <endOfText>
<bot>What's that?<endOfText>
<human>If you think about it, the whole fucking  been going since the early six , mid sixties<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, and they haven't changed at all.<endOfText>
<human>That's a fucking  there is still no other bird that can take off  <endOfText>
<bot>one but its actually the same <endOfText>
<human>I was gonna say which is, is as good , ah, no its not virtually the same, it looks the same but they've got three engines in it.<endOfText>
<bot>Have they?,<endOfText>
<human>What's that?<endOfText>
<bot>Its something like the erm, the legions <endOfText>
<human>The Russians or something like that.<endOfText>
<bot>the legions, something or other will do it, the Russian versions a harrier, its got three engines in it.<endOfText>
<human>Certain  <endOfText>
<bot>Its got, its got er one the downward thrust, one for an angled thrust and one for level thrust, and its got a, they reckon its got about a twenty minute range if it takes off vertically<endOfText>
<human>Are you<endOfText>
<bot>yeah but they've got fucking, just fuck off with the dust <endOfText>
<human>Didn't go in your coffee, sorry<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but its all around in it?<endOfText>
<human>I don't need any more with fucking stupid  come along with everywhere .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, the, its like the old <endOfText>
<human>Yeah<endOfText>
<bot>that, that's not supersonic<endOfText>
<human>ah?<endOfText>
<bot>that's not supersonic <endOfText>
<human>trouble is that, that, that's got  and then they've got the, they've got, its about two or three, they got, they, they never had money to <endOfText>
<bot>trouble is, is <endOfText>
<human>We can't, we can't afford to build any more Concorde's,it costs too much <endOfText>
<bot>They're only about twenty years old, ain't they, they  sixties<endOfText>
<human>Concorde ain't they?<endOfText>
<bot>Sixty nine  <endOfText>
<human>I mean if Britain will, will be <endOfText>
<bot>Did you see that helicopter flying backwards?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah<endOfText>
<bot>Supposed to be, supposed to be the only one that does that.<endOfText>
<human>No, all helicopters fly backwards<endOfText>
<bot>Oh you mean loop the loop<endOfText>
<human>yeah, they also fly backwards there<endOfText>
<bot>oh they <endOfText>
<human>there are two or three that can do it, not many though, that's what I said two or three<endOfText>
<bot>yeah that's right<endOfText>
<human>technically, if they get <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah that, that <endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah, that's the, the  erm<endOfText>
<bot>the only one of its kind <endOfText>
<human>got a little jet outside,<endOfText>
<bot>jets at the back <endOfText>
<human>What about .<endOfText>
<bot>no, one I've seen<endOfText>
<human>can do it.<endOfText>
<bot>the one I've seen is the one without the tail ropers, its just got a little jet out <endOfText>
<human>yeah <endOfText>
<bot>stop the centre  stop the erm  lever <endOfText>
<human>This one had er a have a little can't remember what it was.<endOfText>
<bot>Bells was the maker of it, did a project on it <endOfText>
<human>Gets you, the reason why helicopters haven't been able to do loop the loop unless they've got a lot of height, is because, obviously it pulls you up<endOfText>
<bot>yeah<endOfText>
<human>so if you doing that,doing that keep you up in the air, right, keep doing that you'll go that way, when the helicopter's  you want to do that way, so obviously <endOfText>
<bot>like that <endOfText>
<human>when its like that it tries and pulls you down, and this is why there was an accident with a Wessex or something or a Sea King a while ago, where three or four people died, cos it just didn't get enough height and as, as it got to the top it just pulled it straight down to the ground, it couldn't, it didn't have enough height to clear the circle<endOfText>
<bot>Was that a, a Sea King or something, about ten, ten years ago or something, try to do a, a loop a loop  air show and crashed <endOfText>
<human>I wouldn't <endOfText>
<bot>it was one of these big things, a Sea King or Wessex or something like that  I remember, I remember <endOfText>
<human>didn't really they should of <endOfText>
<bot>that's what I said it pulls them down, erm the Apache can do it now at any height apparently  erm and the , there are, there are two or three particular copter's now <endOfText>
<human>They've got no <endOfText>
<bot>pulls you up  do that goes that way, does that goes that way so you're upside down you see, you've not only got weight and gravity pulling you down you've also got the thrust of the engine pulling you down as well, and the only way the helicopters going to be able to do it is by getting enough height so they can sort of drop like that and they start dropping and they can just pull it back<endOfText>
<human>I remember it as, I think, I think  I think  I remember there was like three or four people inside it or something, certainly wasn't a <endOfText>
<bot>still hold the erm air speed  one of them new <endOfText>
<human>yeah the <endOfText>
<bot>engines<endOfText>
<human>wings are down, yeah<endOfText>
<bot>sixteen engines<endOfText>
<human>four  four, four wing mile  on each <endOfText>
<bot>worlds biggest air .<endOfText>
<human>The old galaxy department er, galaxy class as a enterprise erm, the old er galaxy air lift plane with the  as well <endOfText>
<bot>The Russian's build this things but they haven't got the money to finance them<endOfText>
<human>yeah<endOfText>
<bot>they haven't got the money to keep them running<endOfText>
<human>commercially<endOfText>
<bot>they had the money to commercially run them,<endOfText>
<human>they built, they built a well beaten aircraft and they haven't got half the technical advantages that the West has and their computers has still, practically just got out of the  stage.<endOfText>
<bot>A mate of mine he says he won't tell you  for about three or four years.<endOfText>
<human>Eight twenty-seven, eight twenty-nine<endOfText>
<bot>Eight twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine<endOfText>
<human>A well beaten aircraft  <endOfText>
<bot>I mean I, I heard a stupid story, that instead of like, the, the  twenty-seventh, twenty-eight and ninth come over here, but the  was still, was still using a radio and stuff  taken out the  pre war stuff, that's how far their radio technology and communications  come on.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah <endOfText>
<bot>With the old F sixteen its like a couch, you sit like that, its just the joy stick in your right hand and you've got all your buttons there, whereas the old Russian one's just a p , a normal sit up and  on a joy of a  column, its amazing how they fly,make those flew once they do<endOfText>
<human>ah?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but <endOfText>
<human>A mate of mine actually worked in<endOfText>
<bot>a mate of mine actually worked out in Russia and he said you know,piece of discussions about when, where the Russian's sort of appear first and this sort of he said  he said erm, this, he said that, that kids running around on the streets of Moscow is actually given a working permit and so he could actual work there and  sort of like er<endOfText>
<human>one of the top  in the, the company  and er he said that there are kids<endOfText>
<bot>Mm, I mean you've told me this before Mark, well I, I said to you<endOfText>
<human>kids are fucking running around with just nothing on their feet<endOfText>
<bot>right, that's it, you've, you've told me this three times and I've told you several times as well, the, the Russians put everything they've got into military technology, just because, just because their kids are still running around <endOfText>
<human>They don't  they've still got , they've still got no military technology<endOfText>
<bot>they've got one of the biggest armies in the wor , they have <endOfText>
<human>so <endOfText>
<bot>got the biggest army in the world<endOfText>
<human>so, its all on script <endOfText>
<bot>and they and th , what I am saying is they produce, they produce stuff like the  twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth, don't be fooled because their kids haven't got enough to eat and stuff <endOfText>
<human>they haven't,<endOfText>
<bot>that's, that's the time to worry<endOfText>
<human>they, they still haven't got any, as you say they haven't got anything to eat, I mean what's the point of you putting <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but their military has <endOfText>
<human>everything into military, no they haven't even now <endOfText>
<bot>the military get the best of everything <endOfText>
<human>that was, that was it , that was it, even now, the economy is ruined, there's nothing there <endOfText>
<bot>but I would still bet you that, I'm not gonna say that, that their eating well, but they'll, they'll be eating, they'll be eating twice the amount of as a civilian<endOfText>
<human>that's what I'm saying Mark, what, no matter what the state of the economy, the Russian military will be at the best it can be which will be <endOfText>
<bot>yeah, but  <endOfText>
<human>three or four times better than the civilian's <endOfText>
<bot>some of the guys out there, you know, the Russian people don't want to start anything you know, but also they, they feel they haven't got the technology we have <endOfText>
<human>no, I mean its obvious that <endOfText>
<bot>for , for a start their tanks are still man powered, their still  tanks <endOfText>
<human>no <endOfText>
<bot>you know, he, he said, he said  he said there's still some of the tanks are still <endOfText>
<human>still some of them<endOfText>
<bot>but he said, he said.<endOfText>
<human>but every front line regiment in the Germ , in Germany had, they were the first tank regiment to get completed with er, er, computer optic sights and stuff<endOfText>
<bot>Are you sure?<endOfText>
<human>I should know, I was, I mean ask Mark, you know, how many people are the  are, its very naive to think that, that their civilians are in a, in a poor way but their military is as well.<endOfText>
<bot>It maybe in a poor way compared to what the West get <endOfText>
<human>that's what changed <endOfText>
<bot>but they've got so much  there's eight tanks or something to every fucking one of ours<endOfText>
<human>yeah, so what<endOfText>
<bot>seven combat planes<endOfText>
<human>you've got to you, you none, none <endOfText>
<bot>fucking fifty men<endOfText>
<human>none of their tanks have been tested really <endOfText>
<bot>Afghanistan <endOfText>
<human>look what the Afghanistan did too them.<endOfText>
<bot>look what the fucking Vietnamese did too the Americans and the Americans went in their heavier numbers and more concentration <endOfText>
<human>yeah, ok <endOfText>
<bot>the  than they went into Afghanistan<endOfText>
<human>you, you are trying to determine gorilla war, right, but it doesn't how much technology you've got, because Afghanistan and the Vietnam proved that, but   tried, tested and proved<endOfText>
<bot>yeah, the cheaper  being phased out<endOfText>
<human>yeah obviously they're being phased out<endOfText>
<bot>challenge for us, the  right<endOfText>
<human>yeah<endOfText>
<bot>but on the other hand you've got the T eighty eight the T seventy two which is, that's only like the Correan one but its still got one of the, the erm, the longest range, and the most accurate canons on any tank still, I said the, the Russian military's got some of the best  in the world  and that's giving the fact that they haven't  yeah the, the state of their population<endOfText>
<human>yeah exactly<endOfText>
<bot>and I think where they <endOfText>
<human>cos they <endOfText>
<bot>population starts getting that desperate that's the time when we've got to worry<endOfText>
<human>no<endOfText>
<bot>the Russians are just, just mad enough to fucking go for it<endOfText>
<human>no because they'll do what they, they've always done there send their military in  and they'll  they'll say you aren't having this, you aren't doing that, I mean obviously Gorbachev's   I mean  this stage, he'd just send the tanks in by now, he plagued Yugoslavia crushed  <endOfText>
<bot>so what happened to all this Yeltsin thing right, has  has it been so much build up, speculation of the West, you say thirty years of build up on our part is being wasted, we've really got nothing to fear of the Russians?<endOfText>
<human>No I don't think we have, but I think they'll probably be a Civil War first<endOfText>
<bot>well yeah now, but you, you were saying this, we, we had this conversation when I'd first got here, before any of this started to happen <endOfText>
<human>I, I, I don't think that you<endOfText>
<bot>Here you are <endOfText>
<human>we don't really have anything to<endOfText>
<bot>obviously we got to have fears, because there's something to be , they're the largest nation in fucking Europe so everybody's got to fear them, because they co-hearse all the other  into being part of their group   and that sort of stuff gotta be <endOfText>
<human>lets face it, if, if Russia had wanted to declare war, to, declared war on us, sort of right  ten years after the second World War had finished, and that would of been it, Europe would of been out<endOfText>
<bot>we always did  <endOfText>
<human>because they were scared<endOfText>
<bot>just because<endOfText>
<human>they were just as scared of us as we are of them <endOfText>
<bot>nuclear weapons<endOfText>
<human>yeah, exactly, but other  its not just that<endOfText>
<bot>if we, if there was no nuclear weapons I reckon we would of, probably would of been at war with Russia now<endOfText>
<human>yeah, that's, that is it, that's what I've said er, got  there's one reason, one reason why <endOfText>
<bot>but all these talks, all these talks <endOfText>
<human>I would never of er voted Labour<endOfText>
<bot>yeah, cos its not a union that  <endOfText>
<human>it isn't the biggest deterrent in the world backed by .<endOfText>
<bot>But like I said Mark, er  the mil , NATO never used to think that they can hold the Russian's for very long  in, in conventional warfare's<endOfText>
<human>You're telling me that we've got nothing to fear from them?<endOfText>
<bot>ah?, see, this, this is one of <endOfText>
<human>why has there been such a  Star Wars plan?<endOfText>
<bot>Why has there been such a, a, thing in the fifties and sixties for buying  and that sort of stuff?<endOfText>
<human>you, you, keep  can't actually tell until it does happen  until something does happen and then you know how well that each side is prepared.<endOfText>
<bot>All I know is that there are better people in, that, are more intelligent people that are better informed about  than me or you and they deemed it that we've got something to fear against  and I'm willing to take that.<endOfText>
<human>Fear against?<endOfText>
<bot>Fear against them , I still wouldn't put it past them, I'm not saying they will, I'd be very surprised if they did try to get  cos they're cos they're on the sort of er the brink of being excepted by the rest of the world again, you know, but up until a couple of years ago, this thing happened, you know  conventional warfare were  and they only way we can stop them is by nuclear warfare's<endOfText>
<human>and you think part of the fear is er Russian causing  the fear that communism is now spread three fold around the world.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah you're going on as if , you started off on the fact that you don't think we've got any fear of them cos their kids are running round on the street and now all of sudden you say we have because they've got nuclear weapons you say.<endOfText>
<human>No, I, I just said do you think after <endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah, yeah<endOfText>
<human>by the  which was<endOfText>
<bot>because, one  of state<endOfText>
<human>yeah I'm saying it does, yeah <endOfText>
<bot>one minute shall forcibly put upon the world<endOfText>
<human>well yeah<endOfText>
<bot>by force<endOfText>
<human>that's why the, the McCarthy witch hunt and stuff, the hippies   <endOfText>
<bot>that there is that fear, that is because that is  the second World War  this is why  the erm  the er  late thirties, early forties was never gonna succeed, because they had two completely different archaeologist, plus  now in their purest form their not that  but in the  they were, they were never going to work, I mean that is the fact that their communists, the sole reason they've been against each other for a hundred and fifty years  there is no other reason <endOfText>
<human>if they were capital capitalist you wouldn't have a problem.<endOfText>
<bot>that's why, that's ever since bolshevism first started in nineteen, seventeen <endOfText>
<human>yeah exactly , but I think er<endOfText>
<bot>but then again since, up, up until the mid forties we had nothing to fear from the because they, they didn't have much of an army themselves, they had millions and millions of men but no resources or facilities to build it<endOfText>
<human>The Germans feared them<endOfText>
<bot>yeah because they had, that, that's why <endOfText>
<human>shear weight of numbers <endOfText>
<bot>that's why, that's why during the first World War, Germany made a categor categoric statement that Russia should start disarming, she was mobilising <endOfText>
<human>yeah but shear weight of numbers like I mean America, America and Britain <endOfText>
<bot>Red army <endOfText>
<human>American and Britain are partly responsible for the way the Russians are now cos we finance most of their industry in the second World War<endOfText>
<bot>yeah that's right  but I mean what can you do I mean she was an  Russian was a <endOfText>
<human>, she wants the bear necessity .<endOfText>
<bot>All the reason that we have been against each other is because of economism and we, we <endOfText>
<human>but <endOfText>
<bot>did, did have   and I'll still say the only reason we haven't been at war with them is because of the  army, arm <endOfText>
<human>oh yeah <endOfText>
<bot>neutral wise, yeah<endOfText>
<human>I was thinking venturialise as well, I mean we can't, we can't <endOfText>
<bot>we  hoped to we couldn't never hoped to match them <endOfText>
<human>during the second World War, one German found three hundred, four hundred Russians took them prisoner <endOfText>
<bot>second World War <endOfText>
<human>yeah, took them prisoner second single handed, I mean  <endOfText>
<bot>After the second World War they didn't have a economy in the second World War, now they have<endOfText>
<human>the Russian have fucking one of the most powerful forces, I mean up until the Stalingrad in Moscow, the, the battle of Stalingrad they didn't know if they  at all.<endOfText>
<bot>They were wearing cardboard boots that froze in the winter <endOfText>
<human>yeah exactly <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah <endOfText>
<human>but I mean up until Stalingrad that was it, the, the Russian army was nothing, right, but as soon as Stalingrad came in every  day <endOfText>
<bot>I can't see what the point is that was more than forty-five years ago<endOfText>
<human>yeah, what I'm trying to say is that, that the Germans,on one German captured about four hundred blokes<endOfText>
<bot>what's that got to do with modern day warfare and stuff?<endOfText>
<human>well, I don't know<endOfText>
<bot>its got nothing to do with it<endOfText>
<human>I know but what all going on is the history, that fact is since the mid-fifties we, we have had dealings cos they've been one of the stronger  of the world <endOfText>
<bot>yeah, no, no nobody knows how, how they, how they do things, they've never opened up their army to us  but<endOfText>
<human>I, I don't know how they get there  but they know how our army works, we know how their army works, we cannot hide manoeuvre's and every army in the world knows the manoeuvre's I've been on one big NATO manoeuvre out in Germany right, and you're saying to me they don't know how I, how each army works<endOfText>
<bot>no I'm saying that <endOfText>
<human>why why do military  on our side say that we'll gonna get fucked in conventional war?, we would hold them, we would hold them <endOfText>
<bot>shear weight of numbers <endOfText>
<human>for a year or two years<endOfText>
<bot>shear weight of numbers<endOfText>
<human>yeah<endOfText>
<bot>that's all, nothing else<endOfText>
<human>yeah, matter why we've got anything to do <endOfText>
<bot>if it was one on one, we wouldn't have anything to do, but it is the fact that they have got good technology, good materials and they are that much more than us, their troops aren't as well trained as ours<endOfText>
<human>yes, yes that's, that's one of the class of  <endOfText>
<bot>their, their supply routes aren't as well defined as ours, but they've got shear weight of numbers, see, I'm af , I'm afraid, I could be a fucking karate black belt or something right, so one on one against you I wouldn't have a problem, but if you went and got fucking thirty of your mates I would have a problem, I maybe able to hold you off for a fucking few minutes or something or if you could either contact, maybe a few months or years or something, but they will win<endOfText>
<human>yeah<endOfText>
<bot>and this is why military strategies have always said we were gonna get  we could hold them for a year, two years maybe three, but in the preventional warfare we would start loosing and military strategy have always said along that it would probably be somebody like France or us that would first use the nuclear weapon <endOfText>
<human>Me you fat fart, well he's a fat fucker <endOfText>
<bot>Fuck off <endOfText>
<human>This is really <endOfText>

<bot>yeah but they take it, they, they got documentary  haven't be able to get anybody died  being shot they got people being brought back wounded and stuff, but erm, basically the  there were I R A gunmen there erm  at least three was spotted, say in a crowd that size how many more went unspotted<endOfText>
<human>yeah<endOfText>
<bot>right, its almost definite British  come under fire  but it does seem that the para's did kill erm out of, out of the thirteen, only one had any I R A links, he was a member of the, the I R A  erm, and out of the remaining twelve only three of them might of fired a gun, you know, they  leg  or the hands, by the side, by the gun<endOfText>
<human>yeah<endOfText>
<bot>and er, but apparently they did a, they did a test and that was also a package where the  stuff like that, transfer  although those three may of been carrying weapons, they split open the policeman, but this does seem to  basically at , well not no, not indiscriminately they didn't say that but they shot innocent people, I mean like I said well the  I mean that's got to kill  in those streets and stuff the ricochet's can go quite easily go through somebody  but there, there was, there's always been claims er, there's no I R A gunmen there<endOfText>
<human>yeah<endOfText>
<bot>apart from one Reverend the most Reverend  Doyle or something  and he saw one gunmen and he saw him fire a couple of shots and they told him to piss off out of sort of thing<endOfText>
<human>yeah<endOfText>
<bot>so I mean if, if they caught one, they actually took a photo, managed to take a photo out of all those hundreds of people, look how many more were, were there, and it just seems like basically their not sure who fired first, obviously the Irish say it was the British them and the British say they were fired upon first and erm, on, on the strength of it, who, who would you rather believe I mean, somebody that's been living in Ireland for twenty odd yea twenty years now with all that happening around him being able to be got at by the I R A or a British body who may, may be up on a murder trial, you know, the, at the end of the day its six of one and half a dozen of the other, they've both got stuffed  by a bleeding troop<endOfText>
<human>yeah<endOfText>
<bot>so it really does think that all I<endOfText>
<human>murder trial<endOfText>
<bot>No they were, that's what they were  weren't it when it all happened, the old Revered somebody or other, they  wilful murder  but erm  yeah basically it doesn't seem like, there was no real evidence as to who erm fired first and there was no conclusion that the  about that, but they were certainly I R A gunmen, para's, its like without a doubt if you know some people, but  like with those high powered weapons they may, alright its unfortunately that somebody may have got shot, but it may not of been the main shot, that may, may of been a ricochet or, or anything like that, both their  they've got a killing range of up to three mile  so  one mate come round, he says he's gonna come round again tomorrow and have a look at it  <endOfText>
<human>well if they ring up tomorrow, erm one bloke says he might ring up tomorrow, one said she'll, she'll come round at the weekend and another bloke said  <endOfText>
<bot>said it's a Dolomite <endOfText>
<human>Dolomite, its in the paper, its in the paper for five-fifty, but I told that lady last night is it, what, what is, what's, what's your minimum offer, I said well I want four hundred for it I'm not going to take any less  so I was, I was sort of and<endOfText>
<bot>but erm, I think I  down by his legs,all this and erm, you know, its bang, bang its just like, its over in a split second, you don't have time to be  this, I was there and there  nobody really new what was going on and all this sort of stuff, he was probably one of most honest about , well, one of the most honest little bloke more willing to speak about it,and he had this other one it was right you know like, er, well I'm already taking further than I'm willing to go on this course, what you need is, well look, you know, all I know is that we was  first,saying no more than that,not willing to go.<endOfText>
<human>The only thing, the only thing that all of us said categorically is they were fired upon first, but the trouble is they've had fucking twenty years to, to think up their side and so there's that so <endOfText>
<bot>haven't they?<endOfText>
<human>so have the Irish.<endOfText>
<bot>How many  they reckon fucking<endOfText>
<human>How many  reckon shot them?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I don't know, well, because I mean that any one of them could of said oh well we were being fired upon first and then they could of er, their colleagues fucking  going on <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but the other thing was, it wasn't that, towards the end of the programme, they weren't so much  who fired first, its, erm, there is, there is no evidence either way to support either story, the Irish say there was no Government, there was nobody running for Government  you know, said that they had three <endOfText>
<human>If you can manage to get one photo of a gunmen in all that crowd, how many more were there they didn't get a photo of you know, erm, so that's bull shit for a start  the  said that they only fired upon identified targets, going on motorbikes, and erm, I mean the thing is, the para's are a highly disciplined, highly trained  apparently at a  you weren't even allowed to go out there without at least five years experience  yeah, they were  soldiers, they need  and I can't believe that they negligibly  you know, cos there was women and children there, and nearly all of them had wives and kids, you know, and there was reports from like the Irish saying oh yeah, they were mixing body er, care and body  people and fucking laughing and joking over dead bodies and my old man said yeah if you just, if you just seen something drop most people will  laugh and joke about it, you know I don't know if you've ever meet this sort of,old man, but the service  sort of a, a unique sense of  they can laugh at anything, you know they can see somebody with its guts put out in front of them and they'll fucking crack out about it, its the only way they can stop themselves cracking up, or fucking crying sort of thing.<endOfText>
<bot>And there was this, there was this no conclusive evidence, the only, the only thing that  was that, that these  and make the  said there was only one man definite I R A <endOfText>
<human>and the other  may or may not of been  like I said just the fact I'm shaking your hand,weapon  he goes and does a frenzy test  but the evidence on those three were, wasn't very, wasn't very conclusive and it <endOfText>
<bot>So it doesn't , still doesn't rule them out <endOfText>
<human>still doesn't fit and that's the thing  yeah I mean all this morning was saying  you haven't seen  under fire, they don't stop and look around if they get down into cover he said how they suppose to know who's firing or not?, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>And he, he said but we only <endOfText>
<human>You don't fucking  <endOfText>
<bot>we had a couple of men fire over the <endOfText>
<human>one of them said, you know, he said how, how the hell  how the hell can they say which directions the fire's coming from?but they, I mean some of them were saying like this mate he run out, he was going across this patch of open space and the soldier obviously saw a soldier and as he did that apparently he got shot through there and out the other side of him.<endOfText>
<bot>So the thing is, if he,inconsistent in that story, if he's doing that, that direction how did he get shot from that way, where he's own  telling stories apparently coming from?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah<endOfText>
<bot>You know that's all right he may, might, alright there may of been a soldier there, but they've just come from that direction<endOfText>
<human>yeah<endOfText>
<bot>and then he's, he's going out and they're coming like that direction and he's looked round and he's seen the soldier,doing it, he's gone and this is how I did it and then he put his, like this and he stuck his  hands up and as his done that he's got shot through the body from the side, what's  <endOfText>
<human>he still alive?<endOfText>
<bot>no, he blew his chest out.<endOfText>
<human>You don't get  and fucking live, not many do any way.<endOfText>
<bot>How did he know it was an S L R?<endOfText>
<human>Ah?<endOfText>
<bot>How did he know it was an S L R?<endOfText>
<human>Well that's it, if, if it was a British soldier it was a S L R<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean, I mean he could of been fucking I R A<endOfText>
<human>Exactly, the things they could of,stop inside people unless its,so you can never tell.<endOfText>
<bot>Any one got any  Harry<endOfText>
<human>But yeah, I mean, there was so  so many inconsistencies on, on the Irish witness  side, you know, like what, what matey said I was, I was running out and all of a sudden I felt a pain from here  on those  fuck it, he's up there, got big forearms, and big sort of muscle that size, that's really wasted this side even after twenty years, it must of about  and apparently one matey got shot in the back running away, oh no five out of the thirteen got shot in the back, which again doesn't fucking mean any thing, you know that's , but I said if there's I R A supporters there and that, you telling me you seen where your comrades have fucking get shot, you're not, you're not gonna try and pick up his weapon and stuff  I mean like, it was just a perfect opportunity to, to get one over on the British Forces and I, I said I don't think yet the para's were entirely blameless, but then again I don't think they ever have been  in any of their fucking  <endOfText>
<bot>No<endOfText>
<human>they're not angels, they're a hard regiment, but they're also highly disciplined and highly trained, I've got, I, I, the other thing I couldn't see what good, I mean is it, is it the, I mean its not, its not the anniversaries or any thing so I don't know why they brought the  out, cos I can't see what interviewing people twenty years after the thing happen can do.<endOfText>
<bot>Not, probably not.<endOfText>
<human>Well, well interesting programme, I'll give them that though.<endOfText>
<bot>Not a <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but my old man he's a, he's driving he was driving the  one of the  that's, that erm, Lieutenant Colonel  was in  at the time of the, and he, he was in there  and he said my old man knows for certain that at that time they were under fire, cos they drove in and picked up two bodies and put them in the back of the jeep all under fire<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah <endOfText>
<human>they know for a fact that there were gunmen there, as to who shoot, shot first that's held in tribunal, he, could, he, he'd never know<endOfText>
<bot>Who's that, your old man?<endOfText>
<human>yeah  nearly ever soldier that was there got  Lord Rigdely or somebody, you know<endOfText>
<bot>yeah and er, the, the programme condemned him a bit, basically he  he didn't, there was, there was, he didn't seemed to take in a lo , a whole lot evidence from either side, you know, he did, he did, he didn't seemed to handle the case very well, it was sort of more like it just get it over with quickly and forget it sort of thing.<endOfText>
<human>Sounds like <endOfText>
<bot>I don't know though I mean he, he's, he's allowed that, he allowed that the fact that they could of been unarmed men and all that but he also condemned three of them on the evidence of this lead which he really shouldn't of done, he should of left an open verdict on those few cos lead could be transferred to .<endOfText>
<human>I mean lead can be picked up at  what put your hand on the exhaust .<endOfText>
<bot>Oh well lead so er, apparently if, if you could get in fine detail enough we'd have lead on ourselves, this is why the, this carbon dioxide stuff from the erm <endOfText>
<human>Fucking have that on the inside of the <endOfText>
<bot>They have this, they have this MP there from the S D L P from nineteen sixty-nine to seventy-two and he's a, a pacifist, he went to the, apparently he went to and spoke to the leader of the provisional I R A<endOfText>
<human>no<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know who it<endOfText>
<human>I don't know who it  and apparently he asked him that, are, are any of your men gonna be there and if there are he said, I'm, I'm gonna pull out and use all my influence to stop the march and the I R A police said no there would not be any gunmen there  so I thought yeah, fucking right, oh yeah that's easy to say, and then if like the reporter said and, and you believe him and you have the feeble excuse towards a small community he said, you know what's going on <endOfText>
<bot>fuck off<endOfText>
<human>exactly, I mean this, this is, this is the I R A, they're not part of any fucking small community they are the fucking community unto themselves and that's is that, that was he's answ erm, that was he's answer to the question of do, do you believe him or something, you know, well all in all it was quite interesting <endOfText>
<bot>Oh it might <endOfText>
<human>How're you getting home?<endOfText>
<bot>Naked  you?<endOfText>
<human>Up at half past seven, fucking   <endOfText>
<bot>Set the alarm for half past six, gets another half hour in bed and he's moaning about it.<endOfText>
<human>An hour in bed,<endOfText>
<bot>, so <endOfText>
<human>Fuck off<endOfText>
<bot>Did you see that, that  last night?<endOfText>
<human>Erm  its not the sort of thing I like to watch.<endOfText>
<bot>I, I wasn't watching while  at the time, but erm  basically it seemed like it was six of one and half a dozen of the other.<endOfText>
<human>Don't no nothing about it.<endOfText>
<bot>Thirteen, thirteen supposedly are innocent Irish  got killed by para's by militaries included in the crowd, and all the other's, the Irish say that basically there were no I R A gunmen there which is according to there's proof that they have, they were, erm and like that, the para .<endOfText>
<human>It's all a load of bull shit basically, it seems, it seems that the para's were certainly under fire, with  nobody knows and erm, it does, the only thing that is blatantly clear, all these lying  transferred by the para's and they were like dragging them away and stuff and the only, there's only one member that's had any thing to do with the I R A that they can find out about, that's one  so at least nine weren't firing definitely, erm, three may of done or may not of done  so it looks like the only thing that basic the same is looks like at least nine were innocent, you know its all right for<endOfText>
<bot>No smoke without fire thought<endOfText>
<human>yeah, makes you  I can't see what's good its doing twenty years afterwards, the people had time to think about it and use their memories for twenty years, nineteen seventy-two it happened and they've just sort of done it .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah but<endOfText>
<human>tell you the truth will never come out about that though.<endOfText>
<bot>No, but the, the only good,heard of it is erm  he said and basically any of the para's aren't <endOfText>
<human>Might know.<endOfText>
<bot>They know who they all are.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah they reckon they've got files on it, sort of eighty, ninety per cent of who the provisional I R A and  I R A are.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>One of these will do?<endOfText>

<bot>I once nearly read her diary and I thought no I'd better not <endOfText>
<human>Actually I would, cos if you end up murdering her <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah<endOfText>
<human>she might have some nasty things to say about it.<endOfText>
<bot>Na, course she hasn't<endOfText>

<bot>And you couldn't, you couldn't pry it open, could you?<endOfText>
<human>and it was er open on her bed, she popped out for, for about, I dunno forty odd minutes to get her hair done or something  I was well tempted to have a look, but I thought no if I get a diary and somebody looked, looked through mine I wouldn't be happy about it, so I didn't  its quite a hard temptation but<endOfText>
<bot>It is<endOfText>
<human>quite hard not doing it.<endOfText>

<bot>Its not worth it for you is it, you might have to hang on till after Christmas and try and <endOfText>
<human>I might phone them up and just, ask them if there's any jobs going after Christmas sort of thing <endOfText>
<bot>Can use the good  the things, I mean, for a, for us who haven't got permanent jobs yet <endOfText>
<human>not working.<endOfText>
<bot>That's right, its a job   Has he got the flight out there and everything, they pay for it?<endOfText>
<human>They do, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Is he going on Sunday?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah <endOfText>
<bot>I'd love that, I'd love to pick up <endOfText>
<human>Well yeah,<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know.<endOfText>
<human>I think.<endOfText>
<bot>I should think its quite hard to get into it <endOfText>
<human>Yeah I never thought of that, yeah I suppose its colder  you don't have to take that many clothes out there do you, cos  get out there <endOfText>
<bot>Its a funny old day  <endOfText>
<human>I think if I was going to go Sunday I think I'd buy myself a few  cos that  <endOfText>
<bot>How <endOfText>
<human>I've got two  boxes at home, but I  I mean  its not brilliant, but they do the job for me   could be worth  cos he  driving out there as well, wouldn't mind  start get the old ferry ticket's tomorrow and piss off over there , straight through France,<endOfText>
<bot>Erm<endOfText>
<human>out to Holland  <endOfText>
<bot>they offered me two  for a boat, right and they offered me one while I was there, then I got home and they offered me one that late that evening,job, erm  working like that was a Thursday and they wanted me to start on the week Monday, I couldn't do it  as it happens I had to give my weeks notice here  get out there that quick, so I fucking said, I said to myself well they've  first day, they're gonna offer me a few more, so yeah they offered me a couple more but way from  so, a bit unlucky I, I wished I'd fucking taken it <endOfText>
<human>Well you could of done really, I mean you could of fucking rang in, rang in here on a Friday and <endOfText>
<bot>that's what I, that's what I thought like cos I thought<endOfText>
<human>you know, if they want  the first day, then there gonna have to do another lot so what's the point of sort of yourself out with fucking , I wasn't really sure at the time that I wanted to go to  so, you know, I, I said no I needed this job, but probably a bad   I've been offered a couple of month one's as well, one month and two month's, but I mean the trouble is <endOfText>
<bot>The trouble is there  are they?<endOfText>
<human>I was gonna say if you ain't permanently in employment, you're a bit silly to take that  especially if the er, present climber  and there's one there they offered me said it could be two weeks or it could be two years I don't know, so I  gambler or not, I mean it depends how well you're  you are as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Well most of them they saying are six contracts, now they say, say, six month contract or eight month contract or a three month contract, but I just had a couple that were like oh they could be a <endOfText>
<human>Goal <endOfText>
<bot>couple of months he said he, it could be a couple of years, it depends on how quick it get, work gets done and how long they think they need you.<endOfText>
<human>What time is it?<endOfText>
<bot>forty-eight.<endOfText>
<human>Forty-eight <endOfText>
<bot>Does they put   <endOfText>
<human>Well maybe thirteenth <endOfText>

<bot>Mucking about <endOfText>
<human>the place, sex <endOfText>
<bot>I know you, you, you're not allowed to bath three days before so you can get that fucking French aroma going.<endOfText>

<human>Shaved this Lieutenant Sergeant Major eyebrow off when he was sleeping one night, and he was in front of the, the Colonel Chief and Regional   so what he did, he, cos it, it took, taken ages, took about three months to grow back, so what he did was he shaved the other one off as well <endOfText>
<bot>yeah<endOfText>
<human>and like, just blended it in with like one of these pencil stuff, so funny<endOfText>
<bot>apparently he went, he went round telling everybody erm he was doing a live exercise and he got singed or something   but this, this erm, its Browndown on the South Coast and it was, it was a Christ it was a Christmas piss up, regiment Christmas piss up and anything goes, as long as you don't physically hurt somebody, although that has been known to happen and its not criminal anything goes right, but honestly the worse you do to  somebody the worse they do back to you, and people are getting tied bollock naked up the flag poles, dumped in bins, erm, tied in their beds, put out in the middle of the parade ground, fucking all sorts of things you know, like what we can do, the most common thing is nicking, you know the old walking pay slips they've got<endOfText>
<human>yeah<endOfText>
<bot>nicking them and capture there pay slips and you get it, you get a little brass plaque on it saying captured by so and so and  the date, cos obviously they get fined for loosing it and all that sort of stuff<endOfText>
<human>do they?<endOfText>
<bot>oh yeah its army property, must cost about, they cost about eighty quid or something<endOfText>
<human>What?<endOfText>
<bot>the pay slips they use in the  can actually marked up and its got the exact <endOfText>
<human>You mean you haven't seen them doing it <endOfText>
<bot>oh yeah the people, matey's walking along and he's going like this and he's pulling it as he's doing it, he says  and he's doing it in proper time  like that, but with one arm going he's twiddling it, he's doing it, he says no my feet are exactly  like that, very effective but you can actually get fined for loosing them, you have to pay for them and its like a real, shooting sticks as well,you don't tend to carry erm, these pay sticks you carry them like the old shooting sticks, the old  you know?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah<endOfText>
<bot>we captured them,great laugh about that, really is, its just a, its just a weekend of piss up basically.<endOfText>
<human>Every night in the  fucking raunchiest games, it doesn't matter if your a girl, if your girl and don't want to play fine, if your girl and you wanna play well, quite like the bloke sort of thing you know, there was no, nothing er, no  given, the fact that your a female, and they used to go in as hardly anybody half the time, erm, indoor rugby and shit like that<endOfText>
<bot>yeah<endOfText>
<human>with a  cushion.<endOfText>
<bot>You know, nine times out of ten you don't even get round to take the tables and the chairs out the way, just fucking fall over them<endOfText>
<human>erm  fucking indoor murder ball, the seat, cushion and stuff like that, its fucking well out of order piss up games  oh that's right I think we played in, I think we played, you know that British bull dog thing?, we managed to clear all the fucking the nappy chair this and the chairs out the way, we were playing this British bull dog sort of thing and the only thing, the only, the only difference was when you got caught, got, everybody was fucking giving you a few thumps in the arm, for good measure like, and we played about four of this and every time this cocky little son of a bitch didn't get caught, he was always the last person, so we fucking said, we said, me and this other guy's that are in our troop and that er, we said right we'll get him, so when, when everybody sort of go for it right just after the one person in the middle, said fucking just get this guy and fucking pin him down and do something to him right, we didn't, I think we said we'd just get him, yeah that's a good idea, so he's gone right go and his mate he's fucking took off two steps and there's eight of us fucking dived on top of him, what the fucking, he's struggling, get off you cunt so we pinned him down and at first we was just going to de-bag him in front of the women, we've taken his boots off and his trousers and that and  shave his bollocks, yeah the whole fucking  yeah, it was like an audience, all that they sort of gathered up the chairs and the tables  fuck have his bollocks shaved.<endOfText>
<bot>Well out of order, the thing is if that'd been, if that'd been another troop trying to do it to him, there would of been, there would of been shit <endOfText>
<human>Hell to pay <endOfText>
<bot>but because he knew it was our troop, you know  but erm, that's the thing when you, nine times, about eight times out of ten you did it to another troop, but then again they did it back to you, but this time he was a right cocky son of a bitch, I mean we all liked him, but he was right cocky bastard, so he <endOfText>
<human>So he <endOfText>
<bot>thought he was it so we decided to bring him down three pegs or two <endOfText>
<human>So when did the hair grow back on your bollocks then Stu?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, its thicker now Mark, but they shaved me round here, you know  er, we had , Kevin, Kevin <endOfText>
<human>yeah he was the fucking B U L G A R, he was a right good laugh actually  he's still there, he's a Lance Corporal now   <endOfText>
<bot>Got <endOfText>
<human>I, I, I was lucky in the three ground  I went too the worst that ever happened to me was I was put head first into a dustbin, but luckily it had been emptied it was still well mucky, but I just fucking went and had a shower, and I come out of the shower and I'd got pounced upon again and I was there, it must of been a funny site, there's me right in just a pair of fucking deck chairs that we used to wear for the, the shower block right, fucking shaving, er like the wash kit bag in my right hand and I was holding me fucking towel round, round me waist with me left, I was streaking across the play ground, going as fast as I could<endOfText>
<bot>and about fifteen of the erm eight, eight, five troop  chasing after me, it was like our sister troop  yeah, we were, there was three troops in our squadron, eight, eight, five, eight, eight, six and eighty, eighty, seven and then there was three squadrons and a regiments, there was nine troops there, so like, if it, basically it was your troop and nobody else, but then it was your squadron and, and anybody else and then the few times that I, on  regiment  it was your regiment and nobody else, like, we could touch you cos your our regiment but if you try and touch us,you can get fucking hell , but it nearly always come down to the troops, and the thing is eight, eight, six, only had, the first year that I was there we'd only had about thirty people, fourth year there had I opposed like fifty, sixty and seventy, second year we were there we had about forty- five opposed to like sixty, seventy, eighty, and the third year there we had about fifty opposed like fucking seventy, eighty and ninety in a, in a troop, so we were always well out numbered and we were by far the most outrageous<endOfText>
<human>well, huh, one of our fucking sergeant's right, we were taken erm some of the recruits from another, another troop I mean, er nine, nine, one or something it was one of the other squadron's and er, and he's got them inside where's he's like fucking the old erm <endOfText>
<bot>What time is it?<endOfText>
<human>eleven forty six, he's got them inside, I think I told you about this didn't I?, and I was inside helping them out like, he was outside, he didn't have his gas mask, we were doing the  things, like M B C stuff, and I'm inside and he said right  you will each go to a post, where inside this tent, each to go to er, erm, cos there was six people inside and like there was six posts, he said you each got to a post inside the tent and on the  you will pick up the tent, and I new what was coming, done it before sort of thing  and erm, were all in M B C stuff cos there's still lots of  gas, but there wasn't for very long, and he said right on the  you will, er he just said, we picked it up right, were all fucking  all fucking  I said go on then,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah<endOfText>
<human>and then he's, he's fucking started marching us around the parade square and  and we can't see a fucking thing inside there, and he said er  come out a minute, so I've blinking gone out and I've noticed were about fifty yards from the beach<endOfText>
<bot>so I've got out, I, I said to him you thinking what I'm thinking, he said yeah shall we do it, most out of order it is a bit cold,middle of, middle of December like<endOfText>
<human>twentieth of December or something like that,he's, he's fucking gone yeah, right troop right turn <endOfText>
<bot>so the whole fucking tent shuffle's round, he said, you remember you are part of the British army, if you disobey orders you will be brought up on charges, by the left quick march, and he's fucking walking them to the sea<endOfText>
<human>tent an all<endOfText>
<bot>go on <endOfText>
<human>and like the thing is obviously like the first  realise there on a  and they try to stop it, why are you stopping for, remember you are in the British army, if you disobey orders you'll get a court marshall  really started laying onto them, and like they've started again and like the first bloke obviously got to the fucking water, cos he's stopped again, one man one sides shouting out and  round the other side shouting out and they have they've all gone in, they must of thought fuck it and they've all just fucking marched into the sea, and we marched them in,tent was only about that much above water, and we've  lasted thought, this is the thing that got me, he, he shouted at him, cos we, we, we managed to get them  and that, he said right,right, go in, go in and tell them to come out, what, I said what, can you just pop in and tell them to come out, I said  over here sarge, he said you disobey an order <endOfText>
<bot>I said oh you cunt, said I'm your troop you can't me go in there, he says try me, I said bastard so I fucking  right  sea, fucking over the  right you can come out now, marched back out again gave them a right old  on the way back again,get changed again, alright, I thought you cunt<endOfText>
<human>and er, this is what I, this is what I wanted, to tie  to the flagpole and left him there for about an hour    he had his pasting  as well.<endOfText>
<bot>I, I, I remember you telling er <endOfText>
<human>He was our, he was our squadron but not our troop you see, see if I'd a been his troop he probably wouldn't of made me go into the sea, but it was fucking cold, I mean, I mean full M B C kit right<endOfText>
<bot>yeah, trousers, boots<endOfText>
<human>trousers, boots, fucking the leggings, the gloves, the mask anything, he made me fucking walk into the sea.<endOfText>
<bot>quite like, yeah , I'll never forgive him for that, he's now our troop's sergeant, he's got a transfer to the other squadron  one of these  troops, to er, to a troop.<endOfText>
<human>I went down there about a month ago  say hello to them all.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>, we er, we, we did some, I mean that was  a proper weekend set aside for  but I mean they really  about practical jokes being played and stuff.<endOfText>
<bot>Er well the worse thing we ever done in cadets  was erm,the er  the handcuffs right, trouble was .<endOfText>
<human>I used to like, I used to like the P C<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah <endOfText>
<human>yeah, I did like the  used to make  but I used to like the <endOfText>
<bot>But the thing is once you'd fit you could stay there.<endOfText>
<human>You used to work fucking hard though most weekends.<endOfText>
<bot>Like a lot of weekends  you'd leave, you'd leave the T A centre about eight and then from eight o'clock Friday night too about, well you'd be working until about three o'clock Sunday afternoon, and you are lucky if you'd got three or four hours sleep  working you don't notice, you get tired but you don't feel that bad and it was only like I used to come home on a Sunday crash out about  sleep about .<endOfText>
<human>My old man said he's erm, he used to go down to er, every, every sort of six months or so, cos they were in  he was in charge of fucking then, he'd used to have to go on manoeuvre's about sort of six monthly or something like that<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah<endOfText>
<human>just for re-training sort of thing.<endOfText>
<bot>The first time he went down there he set, set a  had to take the waters out, you know,said you've done it before ain't you  said yeah I did it in  in para's and the bloke said yeah, right he said erm well there's not a lot I can teach you senior N C O's he said you might as well piss off down the pub, I'll see you later  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, then the, the old man and about three or four of these N C O's, he was senior N C O, sort of, sort of  corporal and the rest of them were corporal and lance corporal's, but he was the one in charged of the<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah<endOfText>
<human>water section  and then maybe, maybe the other month he used to  you get about three thousand rounds of blanks and stuff <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah<endOfText>
<human>like we did eh<endOfText>
<bot>did you?<endOfText>
<human>like you do up <endOfText>
<bot>yeah<endOfText>
<human>going for a  that was brilliant I got  and that, and I tried , I had a whole box of er, erm,thing is, when you hold a thousand rounds of ammunition, I got given about two thirds of this box all for myself,so I'm there for about three hours before the exercise  I had and then put the rest in the  then we sat down for another hour filling them up again, superb, we had loads of  bung in the windows  grenades<endOfText>
<bot>ain't you?<endOfText>
<human>it, we, we had to do it properly, but the idea of the  machine gun  go in there and go   away <endOfText>
<bot>Me old man right , me uncle, me uncle used to live in a house which used to  digging in the back garden,this piece of fucking dirt and he pulled out this  and its sort of round, my old man's gone, no he, he said er I wouldn't dig there any more<endOfText>
<human>my uncle's gone oh fuck off like this and he started to put his fork in again and we goes, my dad goes well that look distinctly like a three inch mortar shell so I wouldn't put any more in there if, I wouldn't put your fucking fork's in there again if I was you, they had to get the bomb squad out, they diffused it, they found about five fucking mortar bombs <endOfText>
<bot>Really <endOfText>
<human>in the back of his garden, yeah<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>The thing is  the way the way  <endOfText>
<bot>They, they , what they'd been doing was shooting them over and they'd just hadn't been exploded, they said dud shell or something.<endOfText>
<human>Get the bomb squad out any way, but erm, the British army has got a lot of important  that's they way we would fight the Russians, take over a small hamlet, mortify it and that's how the only way we would ever  up the Russian's grass nest, they take it very seriously, so what they did if they tell us how to do it, walks us through, show us what to do, let us do it and then they'd make us do it again, but without any mistakes and that, it was really good and they showed us how to er mortify  up a house, go, going through all the sewers and stuff is quite fun<endOfText>
<bot>The thing that gets me though is erm, when they done these exercise you've got to <endOfText>
<human>yeah<endOfText>
<bot>ain't got a <endOfText>
<human>you don't obviously, but<endOfText>
<bot>yeah I know.<endOfText>
<human>It is, it is simulate valve which  basically your out in the open and you see somebody firing the regiment , I know its a bit silly but there is no real way, mind you,<endOfText>
<bot>its not, you can't, the thing is you can't defend them without how you die, you can't train people how to avo to die, you can only train them how to avoid it, so it doesn't really matter if you get fired or not, but they show you the drills and you have to do them to the best of your ability  the blank rounds are only there to  the conditions, now this is why they've got these laser  got laser sights all over the body, helmet and torso and the actual weapons got a laser on top and you get, if you get near one of these things you go  dead and your out, and you can actually simulate <endOfText>
<human>but then again  there, but you, you fire off the blank, that's what triggers  the laser  sometimes if there's been a lot of, we did, we did it in  a couple of time see the old laser go, cor, its got very think red beam, its not like you see these big flashing great big bits of light like on Star Wars and stuff, well its not, its not suppose to hurt you  its a very thin piercing beam, its well impressive.<endOfText>
<bot>See the old man was saying when he was doing Salisbury Plain they blew up couple of  and a couple of <endOfText>
<human>Yeah,that is small hard weapons .<endOfText>
<bot>Its about, for, for the kit on use of your body and the stuff that your weapons its about a thousand pounds<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but its suppose to be  in it.<endOfText>
<bot>expense, its er state of the art equipment.<endOfText>
<human>As normal the Americans had it first, had it first <endOfText>
<bot>but we had the  computer system first built <endOfText>
<human>oh not into battleships Mark.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>the only battleship I know about is the girl friend   go away for about three months at a time and you'd say of where's Norman, oh he's er working and then we all knew he's working for a  he'd put them in the computer systems right the way throughout the ships<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah <endOfText>
<human>like I said we at least to go on one complex exercise every month which, although they can't physically make you go on it there was, you know, they more or less made you go sort of thing  pay to do and then we were there the other weekend we had one of these weekends where  be more fun, really hard work though  it'll be more fun for <endOfText>
<bot>See you  <endOfText>
<human>Ah?<endOfText>
<bot>You get back <endOfText>
<human>They still <endOfText>
<bot>that's why they have these  on the end of them  weapon with a yellow fork at the end,but even without that you still get lots of little bits of cardboard come out, its a cardboard wad inside  its the same charge as a  but its a cardboard box, cardboard blank inside<endOfText>
<human>Yeah I've seen them.<endOfText>
<bot>and it shoots it out.<endOfText>
<human>You can shoot them at close range  I mean there was a<endOfText>
<bot>Giant killers aren't they?<endOfText>
<human>yeah there was an actor erm  and he was playing Russian roulette with  and he put it up to his temple, pulled the trigger the blank went off, bloody blew his brains in.<endOfText>
<bot>The thing is, if they always give you  and you, your, nine times out of ten what they do is like, is either, they either put a can over there or a beer or something, they put it over the end of the, the  weapon  pull the trigger and that, even with a flash that can  go like that, and then they show you one with the, the erm  flashes right which have more powerful than the  and they've actually got same again same charge as a life grenade in, but it just plain cardboard so, obviously no trap, but if you lay on them ooh er, you get  or something  you don't throw  what they do now is they put one they light one, put the helmet over the top of it and make it lit, it runs like buggery and it'll go a hundred, a hundred and fifty foot up in the air and inside it looks like its been  and where its been in the thing it'll be like er, six seventy foot off the ground, I mean I laid on one once and I,landed about two foot too my left so I've rolled over, rolled, rolled, and rolled, as I've rolled I've rolled over on my back and I've had all loads of  over, like the, I had a  roll there its like the er <endOfText>
<human>Yeah I know <endOfText>
<bot>stuff keep the  half way up my back its all  padding and stuff and I've rolled over, as I've rolled over there 's been another one it has gone off, it felt like I've been kicked in the back by somebody really having a go at me, it threw me and even with all that I had a  like that  so there not, there not kiddy toys .<endOfText>
<human>How long ago was this?<endOfText>
<bot>Er about, how old was I, I was <endOfText>
<human>Is it, it looks a bit like a, the one laying down.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know, proper weapons I know that, that's, that's  behind me<endOfText>
<human>Yeah<endOfText>
<bot>I turned round and  but still got back in   <endOfText>
<human>I don't believe it, paid all that money for a digital   said look at the  about  stuff, at the end of the day they, he is  five a side football  stuff like that, had  I've been thinking about joining again, but I don't really know what I'm gonna do after Christmas now  even Karen said she wouldn't mind joining but I tried, I managed to put her off that idea.<endOfText>
<bot>See the thing is, what they've said to me, because I've been away now for nearly two years erm I'd have to go back and do all the training again, which is a bit of a pain but its not too bad because I've done it before sort of thing, she said to me oh yeah when you go I, I might come along and see if I like it, and we can do the training together she said, I manage to put her off that idea, manage to talk her out of that.<endOfText>
<human>They still don't like you co-habiting with er <endOfText>

<human>I say Barry old chap<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah they've charged me a fiver's fucking commission on that.<endOfText>
<bot>That's outrageous.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Cor.<endOfText>
<human>Shit.<endOfText>
<bot>Want fucking shooting.<endOfText>
<human>That's over five percent.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>About five an a half, six percent or something.<endOfText>
<bot>No no it's not as much as that.<endOfText>
<human>It's about four  <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Cos five percent on a  on a hundred pound would be a fiver wouldn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>So they charged you er <endOfText>
<bot>About six percent.<endOfText>
<human>five and a half, six percent they charged you.<endOfText>
<bot>Fucking  .<endOfText>
<human>I'm sure when I op opened, I'm sure when I got my T S B they  didn't charge me that much.<endOfText>
<bot>When I bought  .<endOfText>
<human>Mind you that, that was er travellers cheques and they're usually cheaper anyway aren't they?<endOfText>
<bot>They're only a quid for a hundred.<endOfText>
<human>Quid.<endOfText>
<bot>Cost me a fiver when I changed that .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>T S B.<endOfText>
<human>travellers cheques.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Quid for a hundred wasn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Eh?<endOfText>
<human>Every hundred pound you spend you just put  spend a quid over the top.<endOfText>
<bot>Or  every hundred pounds worth of travellers cheques you get.<endOfText>
<human>three hundred pound  <endOfText>
<bot>See I'm I'm only allowed to take fifty pounds worth of rand into the country so I've gotta do it all in travellers cheques.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, it could be right that actually.<endOfText>
<bot>Mind you their rate of exchange  if if you'd have bought all pesetas in this country it would have probably been a better rate of exchange for you.<endOfText>
<human>Rather than out there.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>That's what she reckons anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>She said  she said that <endOfText>
<human>Well that  I I us I got a better rate of exchange out in S A than I did here.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah but that's probably<endOfText>
<human>When I changed up fifty quid's worth here  erm on the Monday  I got four point three five.<endOfText>
<bot>And on the Wednesday when I changed them out there I got four point seven.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah but that's a fluctuation.<endOfText>
<bot>That's a lot of fluctu-fucking-ation though.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, point three five of a rand though.<endOfText>
<bot>Or point point three <endOfText>
<human>But that's still quite a lot.<endOfText>
<bot>Point three five of a rand is fucking nothing when you work it out.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah but  yeah to us.<endOfText>
<bot>To to English money.<endOfText>
<human>To us.<endOfText>
<bot>But they're talking <endOfText>
<human>Yeah but I mean <endOfText>
<bot>about big business and that.<endOfText>
<human>That's a lot of money.<endOfText>
<bot>No<endOfText>
<human>I know it doesn't mean much on a thousand pound or something silly.<endOfText>
<bot>But i like it is I mean  it's quite a lot considering the money markets and stuff.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah I know.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean that's that's the same as fucking out in Spain last year.<endOfText>
<human>The best rate of exchange I got was  how many pesetas is it to a quid?<endOfText>
<bot>I dunno.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah I was, I was getting about hundred and eighty two.<endOfText>
<bot>Pesetas to a quid?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah?<endOfText>
<bot>Well when we were out there it was ranging from any anything from about a hundred and eighty five to a hundred and ninety six.<endOfText>
<human>So that's eleven pesetas, that's quite a fucking bit.<endOfText>
<bot>Used to, used to be over two hundred.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>Last time I went about three years ago.<endOfText>
<bot>When I went out there with Sandra I was told that you normally get a better rate of exchange in the country when you change travellers cheques.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah and she's just ch told me completely the opposite.<endOfText>
<bot>Maybe it was the opposite at the time.<endOfText>
<human>She goes oh sorry  all I've got is hundred franc bills.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay fair enough.<endOfText>
<human>How many of them can I have?<endOfText>
<bot>Well for seventy three forty eight you can have seven hundred.<endOfText>
<human>I didn't think they were gonna fucking hit me for a fiver as well.<endOfText>
<bot>That's a bit fucking off isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>What?<endOfText>
<bot>Hitting me for a fiver commission as well.<endOfText>
<human>That's a bit fucking off.<endOfText>
<bot>You change it back they can stick you again.<endOfText>
<human>If you don't spend it all.<endOfText>
<bot>They fucking better not.<endOfText>
<human>You're not allowed, you're not, you're only allowed to change notes as well aren't you?<endOfText>
<bot>Notes.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>They'll have bricks through the fucking windows at Lloyds.<endOfText>
<human>you don't get  don't get  you don't get the same exchange rate do you?<endOfText>
<bot>You get forty percent.<endOfText>
<human>like  twelve francs to get a pound or something.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>You get stung when you try to  bring them back.<endOfText>
<bot>That'll be a cunt.<endOfText>
<human>I'll walk into a French bank and say can I exchange these back to sterling  and they'll say oh yes and then charge me five hundred fucking francs  again or whatever it is.   no five nines, nine eighteen twenty seven thirty six  forty five francs.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes that will be forty five francs commission mons monsieur.<endOfText>
<human>What, is an Italian bank teller working ?<endOfText>
<bot>Fuck off.<endOfText>
<human>Eh?<endOfText>
<bot>What's a franc?<endOfText>
<human>A ninth of a pound.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Ten p.<endOfText>
<bot>You have to work these things out before you go to France  your money won't you?<endOfText>
<human>That's why I'm gonna take this with me I think.<endOfText>
<bot>Eh?<endOfText>
<human>I'm gonna take this with me.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm going for the  <endOfText>
<human>Ah it's ten p a pint.<endOfText>
<bot>Surely even you could work that out without .<endOfText>
<human>It's five hundred francs.<endOfText>
<bot>You cheeky fucker .<endOfText>
<human>Fifty quid.<endOfText>
<bot>No see that's when me sister went, went out.<endOfText>
<human>She only got four hundred and eighty  odd francs.<endOfText>
<bot>See that's how much it's, it's going up and down.<endOfText>
<human>It's fluctuating.<endOfText>
<bot>She got four hundred and eighty francs for  for <endOfText>
<human>If you swear at me you cunt.<endOfText>
<bot>fifty quid.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Take twenty francs out.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>quid.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah but I paid seventy five  or seventy eight.<endOfText>
<human>And now you got seven hundred.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>So for that two hundred francs more  I've lost about eight quid.<endOfText>
<bot>So now you see why point three five or whatever is  <endOfText>
<human>So?<endOfText>
<bot>Two hundred francs more, ten quid more.<endOfText>

<bot>If I've got my drinking head on it'll be the first three pints in about fifteen minutes if that.<endOfText>
<human>Oh no I can't do that.<endOfText>

<bot>Ten past.<endOfText>
<human>I thought it was about half three or something.<endOfText>
<bot>That's what.<endOfText>
<human>It's fucking shot by and I ain't done any work.<endOfText>
<bot>So what's new?<endOfText>
<human>It doesn't normally shoot by though .<endOfText>
<bot><endOfText>
<human>Hello.<endOfText>
<bot>As you know, these programmes come to you from the University of Sussex, and if you've listened to any of them in the past, you'll know that they're devoted to topics and subjects in which we feel we have some expertise, and which we think would be of special interest to the local community.<endOfText>
<human>We're going to continue with this objective in the coming months in this, the third series, but before we get totally immersed I want to use the first three programmes to stand back to take a more general look at what universities are about today.<endOfText>
<bot>Last week I talked with Laurie Sapper, who is General Secretary of the Association of University Teachers.<endOfText>
<human>He's the dons' union man.<endOfText>
<bot>And today I have with me Geoffrey Caston, who is Secretary General of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals.<endOfText>
<human>Geoffrey, what is that organisation?<endOfText>
<bot>Well it erm goes under that rather queer name in fact it is the association of British universities.<endOfText>
<human>It's the organisation which erm universities themselves have set up and finance in order to promote those interests which all universities have in common, and this includes negotiations with the Government about erm money, it includes negotiations with erm university staff, erm and it includes a general service function of monitoring legislation, Government activity which affects universities, and generally promoting the universities in the public consciousness.<endOfText>
<bot>It's, it, it is a form of accountability of universities to the public really.<endOfText>
<human>But it doesn't control universities, does it?<endOfText>
<bot>No, in no way does it control universities, it's erm each university sends its vice-chancellor as its principal representative or other members to other committees erm in order to erm give their view on what the collective what action the collectivity of, of institutions should erm should carry on in their name.<endOfText>
<human>Universities are very independent organisations and I suppose it, it's more like a league than a governing body.<endOfText>
<bot>Well that's true erm and indeed, erm there is nothing we do which erm requires universities to erm to do anything other than they would have wanted to anyway.<endOfText>
<human>Though that's beginning to be qualified a little because of the erm effects of erm national legislation, for example national employment legislation nowadays requires that all employers in a certain field of employment, and universities is one, erm pursue similar policies towards their staff, and indeed in our case erm pay them on the same pay scales and erm so in that sense we have to enter into agreements with trade unions and others which are binding on our members.<endOfText>
<bot>But that's rather exceptional.<endOfText>
<human>In principle, no, we only act in a consultative and advisory way.<endOfText>
<bot>You are in a position to see what's going on in the university world and therefore I'd like to ask you one or two questions, rather general questions.<endOfText>
<human>It is of no surprise to you and I to know that we are in a erm an economic crisis, and, but I think that we might be accused of being in an area that doesn't take the fair share of the cuts.<endOfText>
<bot>Are universities being cut as much as for example primary schools and secondary schools?<endOfText>
<human>Well, relative to the size of the job we have to do I think the answer is yes.<endOfText>
<bot>If you're comparing us with primary and secondary schools we have to remember that the erm the great erm age bulge pass has passed through the primary schools and is passing through the secondary schools and is still to reach higher education.<endOfText>
<human>And the way that the Government has reduced the provision it makes for higher education erm is that it is has so far erm kept us with the same amount of resources while expecting us to take more students.<endOfText>
<bot>erm In that sense, whereas of course in the case of primary schools there've been fewer resources but of course far fewer students.<endOfText>
<human>So in that sense the resources per student, the funds per student have in fact erm come down by in the region of erm fifteen per cent over the last ten years or so very roughly speaking already, and that's a very considerable reduction in provision.<endOfText>
<bot>So that means that the productivity has to go up, presumably.<endOfText>
<human>That means the productivity has gone up  because, that is if you measure erm productivity entirely in terms of numbers of students taught.<endOfText>
<bot>But it is extremely important to remember that the teaching of undergraduate students in the eighteen to twenty-one age group is only a part, that's the one people usually evaluate universities, but it's only a part of the job which we do for society.<endOfText>
<human>erm The other parts of the job are that we do erm all of the fundamental and much of the applied research which the nation needs, we provide an increasing range of advanced courses in technology for people in industry, and continuing education generally, the number of mature students at all levels is rising, and there are a number of other service functions we do for the community as well as just teaching undergraduates.<endOfText>
<bot>So it's linked very much with the national investment really, in terms of technology, in terms of work force, and so on.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, well I think we believe that to be true, and certainly I think the Government believes it to be true erm we,People often say that the universities erm don't erm satisfy the needs of society.<endOfText>
<bot>I think the important thing to remember there is that erm we regard ourselves as having and people who work in universities regard themselves as having a special obligation and indeed to use their own special skills in order indeed to define the needs of society in their own special field and then to do what they can to satisfy.<endOfText>
<human>The difficulties that sometimes occur is that erm universities are I would say with some justice don't always accept that it is Government and Government departments, ministers and civil servants, who are best equipped to define the social needs.<endOfText>
<bot>We tend to reckon, perhaps rather arrogantly, that we take a rather longer view of the needs of society, and maybe are as close to getting it right as, as, as, as ministers with their day-by-day short-term preoccupations.<endOfText>
<human>There's one section of the student body that has come under the limelight in the last year or two and that's the overseas student body.<endOfText>
<bot>We have a relatively high proportion of our student body that comes from overseas, and a year or so ago when the announcement was made that the fees of overseas students were going up, there was a cry that we wouldn't get any any more, they would all go to America or Russia or wherever.<endOfText>
<human>What has in fact happened?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I think that it's, this is first year after the tremendous increase of fees which the Government imposed upon us erm last year erm increase about threefold, and erm it really is too early to say what has happened even this year.<endOfText>
<human>erm We won't have counted the students that are here erm until next month.<endOfText>
<bot>So it, it is hard to say, erm and I wouldn't like to make a prediction except that I think the number of postgraduate students may have fallen more than the number of undergraduate students, and that we may see already even in this first year erm a substantial not altogether healthy change in the national makeup of overseas students.<endOfText>
<human>They will tend to be richer and from richer countries, rather than erm than, than the kind of cross-section that we would have liked to have before.<endOfText>
<bot>erm I think the real danger however is that over the next three four five years, erm people all over the world will get into the habit of regarding Britain as an impossibly expensive country to study in, because no other country in the world attempts to charge the full cost of it's university education in tuition fees, and erm that gradually people will turn elsewhere.<endOfText>
<human>And this takes time, it takes time to change national habits, but I think it would be very serious for this country if erm in fact those people who want an advanced English language education in the Third World erm turned much more to the United States and, and, and Canada, which seems to be the erm trend, than they do at present.<endOfText>
<bot>And this isn't just a self-interested view on the part of universities.<endOfText>
<human>I've just been at a two day conference at erm not very far from here, at Wisden House in which erm a number of erm top industrialists erm led by the former chairman of I C I have all unanimously been saying how bad they think it is for our future technological development and export development if overseas students get out of the habit of coming here.<endOfText>
<bot>Education in the higher education sense is on the whole something for the eighteen to twenty-one-year-olds.<endOfText>
<human>Is that right?<endOfText>
<bot>Shouldn't we be opening our universities to older people, for people to come back for a second dose as it were, for retraining and so on ?<endOfText>
<human>Certainly.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, on the whole and in the past I think that has been true, but the proportion of mature students, that's undergraduates over the age of twenty-five has erm has doubled in the last erm ten years.<endOfText>
<human>It's now, it's still only about five per cent, but I think that that proportion is growing and I think this is something universities would welcome very much.<endOfText>
<bot>The problem is still there.<endOfText>
<human>erm Is education as good, we all think it's a splendid idea, but surely in this, this day of, of crisis, financial crisis, of hardship, of shutting down hospitals, erm people losing their jobs, surely this is something we really can't afford at the scale at it exists at present?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, the fact is that erm only at present only twelve some twelve and a half per cent, one in eight, of our young people in the eighteen to twenty-one age group go on to any kind of higher education.<endOfText>
<human>This is by a very long way the smallest proportion in the western industrialised world of any country in Europe or North America.<endOfText>
<bot>And erm if you relate that to our erm performance in industry I, I, I think it may well be that we are suffering from being a very undereducated country.<endOfText>
<human>And it's a, it's a tendency which I think we shall regret.<endOfText>
<bot>It's the last place that cuts ought to be made.<endOfText>
<human>But supposing we had to make cuts all the same, supposing we just were forced into it, would you suggest that the best idea would be to close down one or two universities, not Sussex of course but one or two of the other universities?<endOfText>
<bot>I don't really think that, that this is likely to, to be an option which governments have to consider.<endOfText>
<human>I mean if it's just economies you're after, closing down an institution's not the best way to do it, because the plant remains, and, and you can't easily get rid of the staff.<endOfText>
<bot>I think the erm the best way is to improve productivity by taking in more and different students and multiplying the services which we provide for the community.<endOfText>
<human>So, ending on a positive note rather than a pessimistic note, what would you like to see for universities in the future?<endOfText>
<bot>I'd like to see us tapping erm more of the erm of each age group of students coming on erm from school.<endOfText>
<human>I'd like to see erm there is still in this country a reluctance on the part of erm the lower social and economic class children and families to continue in education erm This leads to a position in which, a situation in which in, in the workplace and elsewhere the educated person is still regarded as a, as a sort of rather strange and alien minority person.<endOfText>
<bot>I think this is very bad, I think that I would like to see an expansion of the, of the intake and a broadening of its social base, and by the same token I would like to see erm it possible for more adult students to come in, perhaps on a part-time basis erm into the universities.<endOfText>
<human>That's, that's my vision of the future, and I hope that our present economic difficulties won't frustrate that forever, because I think we shall be a much poorer in both senses of the word society if that's what happens.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you very much, Geoffrey.<endOfText>
<human>Next week we shall be getting the student viewpoint of university life.<endOfText>
<bot>Until then, good night.<endOfText>
<human>next few programmes we're going to take a look at trends in science and engineering, particularly in the way that the subjects are taught and opportunities for employment.<endOfText>
<bot>Today, we're going to start with mathematics.<endOfText>
<human>Maths is a subject that many people find difficult.<endOfText>
<bot>But it's also the language of science.<endOfText>
<human>And even traditional descriptive areas of science such as biology are becoming more mathematical each year.<endOfText>
<bot>The availability of calculating machines, and now micro-computers, must have affected the way that maths is taught, and also possibly the skills that are needed to become a good mathematician.<endOfText>
<human>Now Dudley Ward is a mathematician at the University, who's particularly interested in education.<endOfText>
<bot>Dudley, is maths today taught in schools the same way as it used to be?<endOfText>
<human>No, I think there has been a change.<endOfText>
<bot>There have always been good maths teachers who've made maths interesting and relevant to the children, but I think perhaps the emphasis has shifted from rote learning to helping children to understand what they're doing.<endOfText>
<human>But is this a good thing?<endOfText>
<bot>Surely children need to know what their tables are.<endOfText>
<human>Well, yes, of course, but erm we have to remember that a large number of children have always left school without knowing their tables, without really having got anything out of mathematics.<endOfText>
<bot>So, it isn't as if we're saying, erm maths has always been taught quite well but we can do it better.<endOfText>
<human>The fact is that for most children maths has been taught badly or rather they have learnt it badly for one reason or another, so there is a need for, for an improvement or a change, so the idea that if children can understand something this will help them to remember it or to make it more real to them, this does seem to be a shift over the last generation.<endOfText>
<bot>All right, I take your point.<endOfText>
<human>But let's, let's be concrete about this.<endOfText>
<bot>Take multiplication, for example.<endOfText>
<human>Now there's obviously an old-fashioned way of doing it, two twos are four, two threes are six and so forth.<endOfText>
<bot>How would you do it these days?<endOfText>
<human>Well, I think there are many assumptions made by teachers.<endOfText>
<bot>They assume that when a child hears ‘Two twos are four, two threes are six’ that they've got various pictures in their heads, various ideas onto which to attach these symbols and these words.<endOfText>
<human>Supposing you say to a child ‘What is four times two plus one?’<endOfText>
<bot>Now assuming he knows what four times two is and assuming he knows what two plus one is and so on, he may come up with the answer ‘Nine’, or he may come up with the answer ‘Twelve’, and they're both right.<endOfText>
<human>erm Simply because you can interpret the question in two different ways.<endOfText>
<bot>Now when we were taught sums like that, probably erm they were written down and we had special ways of writing it to distinguish between the two cases four times and then two plus one added together, to give us four times three equals twelve, or, four times two, which is eight, add one, which is nine.<endOfText>
<human>Now clearly we can teach a child a rule if the child is willing to learn that if we put the two plus one in brackets then that means add them together first and then multiply.<endOfText>
<bot>And we had elaborate rules for, for doing this erm some of us will remember, but on the other hand a large number of people listening won't remember, though perhaps they were taught that.<endOfText>
<human>At the same time they're faced with that particular problem repeatedly.<endOfText>
<bot>They pick up a calculator, and everybody's got those these days.<endOfText>
<human>If you type in ‘Four times two plus one’ what do you get?<endOfText>
<bot>Do you mean add the two to the one and then multiply by the four, or do you mean multiply the four by the two and then add the one?<endOfText>
<human>It's got to be important to the child to make the difference between these two alternatives.<endOfText>
<bot>It's got to be important to the child so that he needs to know whether he means four times two-plus-one or four-times-two plus one, whichever way it is.<endOfText>
<human>Let me give you an example of, of how this is done with a computer game.<endOfText>
<bot>I expect you'll want to talk about computers later but there's a simple computer game which, which shows a screen with thirty-six numbers from one to thirty-six.<endOfText>
<human>And then three dice, electronic dice are thrown, and you get three numbers showing up on the screen.<endOfText>
<bot>And the child has to combine those three numbers to fill one of the squares on the screen.<endOfText>
<human>Let's suppose the dice show up with a four, a two, and a one.<endOfText>
<bot>Now it may for the game that if he can cover the square number twelve, he will score more points than if he covers the square with the nine.<endOfText>
<human>So it will matter then to the child that if he types in four times two plus one, it's got to be the right version of that sum.<endOfText>
<bot>So it then becomes important to the child to know, how do you say, four times two-plus-one.<endOfText>
<human>He needs to, but he's got to want to be able to that, and if he does then he'll learn it, he'll understand that putting brackets round the two and the one means do that first.<endOfText>
<bot>And I think that's perhaps a difference.<endOfText>
<human>The rule's important, but it should come from a need of the child rather than be imposed at some arbitrary time when the teacher thinks that all the children are ready for that rule.<endOfText>
<bot>I see very much what you're saying, but isn't there a sense in which you almost need to absorb in an automatic sense some of the basic things?<endOfText>
<human>I mean to have to work out from first principles erm four plus three is seven every time, you may be able to do that with great understanding, but there's an awful waste of time if you've got to understand it each time.<endOfText>
<bot>Surely there's a, a certain balance between the, as it were the rote-learning of, of fixed things, and the understanding of what you're doing?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, of course, and there has to be a balance, and we mustn't go too far to one extreme.<endOfText>
<bot>Many maths lessons today start with a ten-minute mental test as indeed perhaps ours did.<endOfText>
<human>One thing has come out of recent research, perhaps it was known all along.<endOfText>
<bot>Teachers no doubt have suspected it, and maybe known it for themselves, but it is a fact that a large number of children at present leave school at sixteen knowing less mathematics than when they entered at eleven.<endOfText>
<human>Now presumably they've got more interesting things to think about when they're sixteen than they have when they're eleven, but this is a sad fact.<endOfText>
<bot>Now if some of the mathematics they had learnt had been relevant to them and interesting to them maybe they would have remembered it in the same way they've remembered plenty of other things that are important to them.<endOfText>
<human>So, sure, we do need rote-learning, we do need to be able to say ‘Three times four is twelve’, we mustn't have to work it out on our fingers.<endOfText>
<bot>We've got to have the, the fact at our fingertips.<endOfText>
<human>Old-fashioned mathematics you used to have to do calculations of how many square feet of linoleum you <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>needed to lay on a floor or <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>or how much water to fill a pond and things <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>like that.<endOfText>
<bot>The new maths seems to be much more to do with sets and groups and slightly abstract ideas erm do you think this is a retrograde step?<endOfText>
<human>It would be if that was quite as true as, as you imply.<endOfText>
<bot>I think a lot of the modern maths that we've, we've heard about is still very much aimed at the brighter children who were going to do O-level and, and beyond even in mathematics.<endOfText>
<human>Even the S MP syllabus, which is probably quite well known, most schools in Sussex deal a little bit with the S MP New Maths Syllabus, which has been going twenty thirty years now, but even that was originally written for O-level, and then a version for C S E was introduced.<endOfText>
<bot>But even then you see you're dealing with the top fifty per cent of the population.<endOfText>
<human>Computers have come into schools both at secondary level and primary level.<endOfText>
<bot>Is it worth having computers in primary schools?<endOfText>
<human>Well, I think so.<endOfText>
<bot>There's considerable argument about this.<endOfText>
<human>Many secondary teachers are worried about it because they say ‘The children are coming into the secondary school having perhaps used computers and we can't offer them computing for two or three years, erm you know and they're going to be very frustrated, erm and so perhaps they shouldn't go into primary’.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm sure though they have to go into primary.<endOfText>
<human>You can't shut your eyes to it.<endOfText>
<bot>The children are going to have them at home anyway, so if the teachers deny themselves this extra resource, and deny themselves the experience which the children can bring, I think they're cutting themselves off from a tremendous source of encouragement and motivation.<endOfText>
<human>There are a number of computer games that one can get erm there's Speak and Spell and I think there's another one called Little Professor.<endOfText>
<bot>Are these worth while as far as parents' buying them for their children are concerned?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I think they are.<endOfText>
<bot>I think you shouldn't expect too much from them, but I think anything which makes maths interesting or enjoyable is worthwhile.<endOfText>
<human>Another one, while we're talking names, is Big Track, which is a lovely little programmable tank which, that you can guide around, round the carpet and put in programmed instructions.<endOfText>
<bot>And these are used a lot in schools as indeed are the Little Professor and the others.<endOfText>
<human>erm I'm all in favour.<endOfText>
<bot>I think it opens up the child's awareness to what's available and what's coming erm moves them on into the next century really.<endOfText>
<human>You run a centre at the University which is aimed to help schoolteachers in their computing questions.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, we do run many courses, well, I say many, but several courses for teachers in service erm courses.<endOfText>
<human>This is for teachers to come in the evenings after school and erm work with computers and perhaps more important is discuss with each other how they're using computers or whatever in, in their classes.<endOfText>
<bot>There's a tremendous enthusiasm, partly I suppose because they don't want to be left behind in the, the new technology, but I think, more positively, that they see the advantages and some of the benefits that may come from having these machines in their classrooms.<endOfText>
<human>How do teachers get onto these courses?<endOfText>
<bot>The courses are advertised in the, in the schools and in the, in the staffrooms.<endOfText>
<human>There are many courses being run now.<endOfText>
<bot>Computer awareness courses at the teachers' centres, the local authority are running them, erm there are user groups in Brighton and the, the area for, for such erm teachers and the University as you say runs courses with the Department of Education and Science erm to help primary and secondary teachers.<endOfText>
<human>So if the teacher wanted to find out about the courses they could either contact the University or their own organisations, erm the D E S or the, the Local Education Authority.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, I think the teaching profession as a whole have got quite good access to information about the courses if they, they want to find out now.<endOfText>
<human>Returning to mathematics for a moment, it's often been called a very difficult subject.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you think maths is difficult?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I do.<endOfText>
<bot>I think there are large chunks of mathematics which are very difficult, and there are large chunks of it which are difficult to teach.<endOfText>
<human>Partly of course because as soon as you understand it you say, ‘Oh, yes, of course, how easy, how simple!’<endOfText>
<bot>And then, how do you communicate that to other people?<endOfText>
<human>I think mathematics is a very hard subject to teach.<endOfText>
<bot>Looking at maths as a much wider subject, as a subject perhaps for research and for exploration, have there been any very obvious trends in mathematics in recent years which could be described?<endOfText>
<human>Well, I don't want to get too technical because mathematics does get very esoteric and erm it's a real Tower of Babel to research mathematicians.<endOfText>
<bot>We become less and less aware of what our colleagues are doing in mathematics even.<endOfText>
<human>So there are fashions in subjects which come and go, and one major breakthrough will be made and then suddenly there's lots of people working in that area.<endOfText>
<bot>And of course because mathematics isn't directly attached to anything else, any other subject area, it can follow the whims of individual researchers, so at that level things come and go.<endOfText>
<human>And lastly, Dudley, is maths a good subject for a job?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, yes, it still is.<endOfText>
<human>Even when there aren't seemingly many jobs for anybody I think a mathematician is probably as well off as anybody to get a job, almost at every level.<endOfText>
<bot>erm Indeed one of the sad things perhaps at the lowest level is how many jobs are requiring mathematical skills that, that perhaps twenty years ago weren't assumed.<endOfText>
<human>It's very hard to find a job which doesn't involve some interaction with machinery, with computing or whatever.<endOfText>
<bot>And all this requires a certain level of mathematical skill.<endOfText>
<human>And at  the more maths you know, I think, the easier it is perhaps to get a job, and perhaps to be able to choose an interesting field.<endOfText>
<bot>There aren't many people who are actually spending their life doing maths.<endOfText>
<human>They're, they're doing things which perhaps require an understanding of maths.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, thank you very much, Dudley.<endOfText>
<human>That's all that we have time for today.<endOfText>
<bot>Next week I shall be taking a look at chemistry.<endOfText>
<human>Is chemistry still all test tubes and bad smells, or has this subject too changed from the days when perhaps some of us were at school?<endOfText>
<bot>Until next week then, good-bye.<endOfText>
<human>Hello.<endOfText>
<bot>This is the second in two programmes in which I talk to Professor Nuttall about Shakespeare and his plays.<endOfText>
<human>I find it amazing that Shakespeare's still as popular as ever, and I started by asking Tony why this was the case, and why after all these years people still seem to be able to find something new to say about him.<endOfText>
<bot>Speaking as a, an old university hack who's been teaching courses in this place since 1962, the Shakespeare course is the one thing which is utterly and deeply different every time I teach it.<endOfText>
<human>Trying to stop short of bardolatry, but it really is astonishing.<endOfText>
<bot>I get the feeling that I begin to know my way round, to know that at least most of the chess moves of it.<endOfText>
<human>With Shakespeare, almost every time I read more than forty lines, I see something I'd never seen before, which is demonstrably there.<endOfText>
<bot>erm He does seem to me to be the best.<endOfText>
<human>I mean all this common opinion is true.<endOfText>
<bot>He is a writer of indefinite richness and it, it is amazing but the case.<endOfText>
<human>erm Nothing to add really.<endOfText>
<bot>One does quite generally find more all the time.<endOfText>
<human>Do you think it was the case that when Shakespeare was actually writing these plays he had any real concept of the richness of what he was producing or is this erm all a superstructure which has been put there by various university professors since?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I think it's not erm a superstructure that's been put there, because, I mean for example when you get a particular idea, there are often other questions you can ask to check whether it's really present, to see whether the thing is alluded to at the appropriate point later in the plot and that sort of thing, and erm again and again you find that it is, that the thing you half suspected is mentioned by a character later.<endOfText>
<human>And when I find that I'm strongly inclined to suppose that Shakespeare has put it there.<endOfText>
<bot>The question, whether he was conscious of all these layers when writing, seems to me unanswerable.<endOfText>
<human>I have no doubt that he was very very intelligent, in the ordinary meaning of the word, for example I think he probably had a very high I Q, for what that's worth.<endOfText>
<bot>Ever since Ben Jonson people have thought of him piping native woodnotes wild and not being terribly educated.<endOfText>
<human>Education isn't the same thing as intelligence, he had lots of intelligence and not all that much education.<endOfText>
<bot>I think he was conscious of a great deal probably, but at the same time, many writers will tell you, that they find when they've finished a poem or a play, things in it, demonstrably in it, systematically and intelligently present with real relations, which they don't remember writing.<endOfText>
<human>This is why you often get writers saying, ‘Don't ask me, look again at the poem,’ or ‘Trust the tale not the teller’.<endOfText>
<bot>And the marvellous thing in Plato, of Socrates, erm when he'd been told by the Delphic oracle that he was the wisest of men, he, he started off like a sort of good Popperian scientist trying to falsify this, erm and he went round finding people wiser than himself, and he went to various people and they weren't any wiser, and then he thought, ‘Oh, the poets!<endOfText>
<human>They're marvellous people.<endOfText>
<bot>They know so much.’<endOfText>
<human>And he went to them, and he found that they hadn't a clue what they'd written, and he concluded, quite soberly, that they must have been visited by a Muse.<endOfText>
<bot>Seems to me a very reasonable conclusion, I mean you can redress it up in Freudian terms and say their conscious did it, which is really very similar thing to say, I mean the unconscious becomes a sort of god in that case.<endOfText>
<human>erm So what I'm saying is, my guess is, and it's no more than that, that Shakespeare was probably conscious of a lot of it, but there's also probably an area that came from a very rich and active unconscious.<endOfText>
<bot>But all that's just guessing, I mean we've no way of testing it.<endOfText>
<human>To what extent do you think that the creation of, of all these as it were structures on <endOfText>
<bot>mhm<endOfText>
<human>on Shakespeare is a useful exercise, or do you think it's a little bit like sort of mediaeval philosophy in, in taking a little a, a long, long way?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, it's like mediaeval philosophy in that it's not utilitarian.<endOfText>
<human>To me, the justification really depends on the fact that I view Shakespeare as a terminal good.<endOfText>
<bot>That is to say I think that a world without Shakespeare in it would be a world substantially impoverished.<endOfText>
<human>I think Shakespeare is a good, complex thing in the universe .<endOfText>
<bot>That I take as a sort of axiom, as, as, as given to start with in this argument.<endOfText>
<human>Then, it follows from that, that understanding Shakespeare, and keeping the understanding of Shakespeare alive, is also a good, because if for example this great, rich and wonderful thing were simply there in the world and no one could see him and no one could understand him and no one was any longer thinking or talking about him, that also would be a secondary impoverishment.<endOfText>
<bot>And erm I don't feel any shame therefore about going on with it.<endOfText>
<human>Really what I was saying is I, I think probably came over but I will rephrase it.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm sorry.<endOfText>
<human>There's a sense in which, to put it in current terms,<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>When I say ‘I, I am cold’,<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>I may just mean  I am cold and <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>it may not be a statement about my view of myself with <endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>regard to society and <endOfText>
<bot>Sure.<endOfText>
<human>my particular stage of <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>middle-age crisis  and so on and so forth although you know given a certain number of intelligent people they could no doubt build an enormous <endOfText>
<bot>Yes <endOfText>
<human>emphasis <endOfText>
<bot>Well <endOfText>
<human>on, on a simple <endOfText>
<bot>erm <endOfText>
<human>straightforward statement ‘I am cold’.<endOfText>
<bot>And I just wondered whether, you know extrapolating backwards, whether we're doing the same disservice to Shakespeare.<endOfText>
<human>You, you're talking to the wrong man on this, I'm not in sympathy with you, you see.<endOfText>
<bot>You're, you're putting the point about over-reading Shakespeare.<endOfText>
<human>You'd find lots of academics erm at the Shakespeare conference in Stratford, who would agree with you that there is far too much over-reading of Shakespeare.<endOfText>
<bot>I tend to think it's rather hard to over-read Shakespeare, simply because of the experience of, of finding that my reading fell short on many occasions.<endOfText>
<human>It is very easy to read him wrong, and to make mistakes, and there are of course occasions when he does offer a brutal simplicity which it would be ridiculous to, to try and develop.<endOfText>
<bot>I myself, for example, tend to be erm an old-fashioned Coleridgean psychologistic critic, you know, I look for motives in Shakespearean characters in ways which L C Knight's told us we shouldn't do.<endOfText>
<human>And I do this because I think Shakespeare encourages us to make inferences and to think about them in that way.<endOfText>
<bot>However, if you take characters like Lysander and Demetrius in A Midsummer Night's Dream, it's obvious , even to me, that it would be ridiculous to try and look for complex psychology and motivation in them.<endOfText>
<human>You know, there are cases where you can over-read, sure, but by and large over-reading is not the main vice of Shakespearean criticism.<endOfText>
<bot>If anything, we went the other way after erm ‘How Many Children Had Lady Macbeth?’ and we under-read.<endOfText>
<human>We decided that Shakespeare's plays were mere patterns of imagery without human beings in them, and, by a strange act of critical abnegation, deliberately blinded ourselves to all sorts of psychological insights, which the Victorians had been able to see, and are now being seen again.<endOfText>
<bot>One of your major interests has been that of the relationship of allegory <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>to Shakespeare in plays of one kind and another.<endOfText>
<human>erm Could you tell me a little bit about that?<endOfText>
<bot>Well.<endOfText>
<human>My interest in allegory really began at quite a different point.<endOfText>
<bot>I was initially troubled by a philosophical problem.<endOfText>
<human>Can I explain that?<endOfText>
<bot>Do.<endOfText>
<human>Or try to?<endOfText>
<bot>Go ahead.<endOfText>
<human>I was struck by the fact that in one of the dialogues of Plato, Plato gets very worried about the notion of beauty, because he thinks beauty is something which is beautiful.<endOfText>
<bot>He also thinks beauty is that in virtue of which we call beautiful things beautiful.<endOfText>
<human>Now if the beautiful things are beautiful, and if beauty itself is beautiful, what of the beauty in respect of which both beauty and the beautiful things are beautiful?<endOfText>
<bot>Is that also beautiful?<endOfText>
<human>Sorry, this is pretty mind-blowing.<endOfText>
<bot>But he has got himself into difficulties because he thinks that beauty is not, so to speak, a logical construction that allows us to talk about particular objects in the world.<endOfText>
<human>He thinks it is itself a sort of spiritual thing.<endOfText>
<bot>He thinks it is itself something beautiful that sort of swims down into our world and is incarnated in particular objects.<endOfText>
<human>And then he wonders about that because his own way of forming universals means that he'd have to do it all again and again and again, in an infinite regress.<endOfText>
<bot>So he has a problem basically about calling beauty itself beautiful.<endOfText>
<human>Now, meanwhile, or not meanwhile, quite a lot later, in early mediaeval allegory, you find that the allegorical poet has a quite ordinary technical problem when he's writing about things like mercy and cruelty.<endOfText>
<bot>He wants to show the relation of mercy and cruelty, and of course they conflict, so he writes a poem in which there's a battle and there's a character called Cruelty who comes and fights against a, a character called Mercy.<endOfText>
<human>Now Cruelty is going to be shown as cruel, because that's the way allegorical poetry works.<endOfText>
<bot>Mercy is going to be shown as merciful.<endOfText>
<human>So as soon as they start to fight Mercy starts trying to forgive Cruelty and Cruelty easily wins, whereas he wants to say of course that Cruelty, in this God-governed universe, is going to be defeated by Mercy.<endOfText>
<bot>So he's got a technical problem.<endOfText>
<human>His technical problem again arises basically from the fact that he calls Cruelty cruel.<endOfText>
<bot>Most modern philosophers would say it was nonsense to say that cruelty was cruel, you can only call people cruel, particular things.<endOfText>
<human>So there they both are, Plato with a metaphysical problem, the poet with a technical problem, because of their habit of referring to universals with adjectives derived from the universal.<endOfText>
<bot>Calling beauty beautiful, calling cruelty cruel.<endOfText>
<human>When I looked at all this stuff, it came to me that it was very interesting that they thought of beauty as beautiful and cruelty as cruel.<endOfText>
<bot>It mean in fact that they were thinking of abstractions in quite a different way from the way we think of them.<endOfText>
<human>erm The technical word for this is that for them, universals are self-predicating.<endOfText>
<bot>That sounds very dry-as-dust and unintelligible.<endOfText>
<human>It means, in effect, that they had a quasi-sensuous way of seeing abstractions.<endOfText>
<bot>They saw abstractions as in some way warm and coloured, and the sort of things to which you could appropriately apply quite vivid adjectives.<endOfText>
<human>Now that in turn means that the poetry of the period, and the allegorical poetry of the period especially, is not, as F R Leavis would probably have assumed, to be divided into cold, intellectual abstractions and warm, sensuous particulars.<endOfText>
<bot>There is a sense in which the very abstractions have a sensuous property, perhaps through a philosophical mistake, but nevertheless it was the way their minds were built.<endOfText>
<human>You can see their minds were built that way because of the problems they get into both philosophically and technically.<endOfText>
<bot>Therefore, I  decided that I had the clue to something that had long baffled me, that whereas Leavis's strict division of the world into sensuous particulars and more intellectual abstractions — I hope I'm being fair to him, I'm caricaturing and shortening — whereas this was applicable to the modern period, it probably wasn't to the period, I decided I think roughly before the eighteenth century.<endOfText>
<human>And with this in mind I then turned to the mysterious last plays of Shakespeare that we've been talking about earlier, erm and tried to see whether the sense one gets in those plays of love, for example, not as erm simply a logical construction for talking about the way people talk in relation to each other , but as some kind of spiritual entity, existing prior to the human subjects in the play, whether that sense could be in some degree confirmed and explained by an investigation of the general use of universals in the period and earlier.<endOfText>
<bot>This erm approach could be explored with, with other sorts of literature, the Bible <endOfText>
<human>Yes indeed <endOfText>
<bot>for example <endOfText>
<human>Yes, it <endOfText>
<bot>I would have thought was a rich ground.<endOfText>
<human>it, it could.<endOfText>
<bot>One thing that I had to say, frankly, at the beginning of my book on allegory, was that The Tempest was not the necessary base of that book.<endOfText>
<human>It was in fact just a peculiarly rich and extended example.<endOfText>
<bot>And the kind of thing I was doing was in principle applicable to great numbers of texts.<endOfText>
<human>That was why, when you first asked me about this, I turned the whole question round and said, ‘You have to begin from the philosophical problem’.<endOfText>
<bot>But indeed, it could be applied in many places.<endOfText>
<human>Let me pick up a few points which occur to me arising out of what you've just been saying.<endOfText>
<bot>erm First of all, beauty,<endOfText>
<human>mhm<endOfText>
<bot>which is a word  which is used by all sorts of philosophers <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>and erm wasn't it Ayer that made great erm mileage out of saying, ‘Just because there's a word for beauty doesn't mean to say that there's such a thing as beauty’.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, well, Ayer, there, stands as a sort of paradigmatic modern philosopher.<endOfText>
<bot>And when I was saying earlier that it was just a logical construction to help you to talk about particular things, and I think Ayer would go along with that.<endOfText>
<human>He is in fact opposing himself to the view I was trying to get out of the older writers, namely that ‘beauty’ is the name of some sort of spiritual being.<endOfText>
<bot>As a non-philosopher I always used to find that a slightly depressing statement, that of Ayer's about beauty, and it seemed to me that one could perhaps immediately follow  that by saying ‘Just because there's a word for it maybe, you have it because you like it and you want to use it and isn't that self-  validating in a sense?’<endOfText>
<human>Well erm it may not be quite as depressing  as you think.<endOfText>
<bot>Someone who says there is no actual entity separate from the world called beauty could still be a chap who believed that the word ‘beautiful’ had a vivid and important use.<endOfText>
<human>He would simply say it refers to all those aspects of things which makes them beautiful, considered in sum.<endOfText>
<bot>And that, if you think of that as a sort of mental object for a moment, is a very rich one.<endOfText>
<human>erm It doesn't for example necessarily imply that statements about beauty are merely subjective, or are delusory or are soft-headed or  Though maybe Ayer would want to say that on another occasion.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean Ayer can be very depressing, you know, I'd  go along with that all the way.<endOfText>
<human>That's all that we have time for today.<endOfText>
<bot>Until next week then, good-bye.<endOfText>
<human>This is the first in a new series of twelve programmes on opportunities in education.<endOfText>
<bot>The contributors will largely be from the educational faculty at the University, and in this first programme I have with me Professor Tony Becher, who is Chairman of the Education Area.<endOfText>
<human>Tony, what do you think are the main trends in education today?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I think there are three perhaps one could erm broadly distinguish between.<endOfText>
<human>Conveniently one of them you could call long-term, one medium-term, and one short-term.<endOfText>
<bot>If I think the short-term one first, that's perhaps the most obvious one, in the sense that most is written and talked about it at the moment, erm namely the cutbacks on expenditure in education.<endOfText>
<human>The medium-term one I would say is to do with broadly the attitudes of society towards education, and those attitudes have in fact undergone a fairly substantial change over the last ten years or so.<endOfText>
<bot>And then the long-term ones are to do with demography, with the birth rate, with the number of children in schools which, as most people are probably aware, have gone down dramatically in the last decade.<endOfText>
<human>Well taking these in the order you suggest, the short-term.<endOfText>
<bot>There are are cutbacks in education, there are cutbacks in everything in the, in the country at the moment and this is obviously linked with erm recession.<endOfText>
<human>How have the cutbacks affected education?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I think that particular factor has been the most negative one of all.<endOfText>
<human>If people get the impression that the education system is in a thoroughly depressed state, erm I would want to argue against that in general, but I think it is true that the short-term cutbacks have made everybody erm thoroughly anxious and miserable, anxious about their jobs, miserable about not being able to produce resources for education.<endOfText>
<bot>And of course the one minor consolation is that that kind of trend is not necessarily going to last forever.<endOfText>
<human>erm It could be that erm with a different political regime, you might get a positive commitment not to run down things like the schools, the hospitals, British Leyland, erm British Airways, British Steel and the rest.<endOfText>
<bot>But certainly at the moment, erm and at least until presumably the next general election, erm nobody can see much light at the end of that tunnel.<endOfText>
<human>One of the difficulties, I would imagine, is associated not just with the level of cutbacks, but also the scale of time in which they're have to be implemented.<endOfText>
<bot>I could imagine institutions, for example, being told to be in a different position perhaps in five years' time or ten years' time, and being able to do this by a variety of means, working towards it, whereas, it seems to me it's a very much harder problem, although it's, it's understandable as I said in the, in the present circumstances, to actually be able to take on this properly and do a proper job of change in a time scale of perhaps one year or maybe even less than that in some cases.<endOfText>
<human>Well, that's absolutely right, of course.<endOfText>
<bot>It's more at the medium-term level that you can talk about the system making sensible adjustments to new circumstances, and indeed, many schools and many Local Education Authorities have simply had to do that, they've had to erm adjust to much smaller numbers of pupils, correspondingly smaller numbers of teachers, and a much more static situation generally.<endOfText>
<human>That adjustment has not been without its advantages, in fact.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, let's hear about some of the advantages.<endOfText>
<human>One of them is at the post-compulsory level of schooling, where people no longer have to be at school.<endOfText>
<bot>There's been an increasing tendency for people to stay on at school because they really want to, where it was one of the great criticisms of the boom years that people simply stayed on the escalator regardless, didn't think whether they wanted to stay on to, into sixth form, didn't think whether they wanted to go on to university or higher education, erm just did it without thinking.<endOfText>
<human>Nowadays it is much more a matter of choice.<endOfText>
<bot>It's also clear that the teacher population has erm improved in the sense that it's become much less mobile.<endOfText>
<human>In the days of very rapid expansion, teachers in some inner-city schools stayed there on average about three years.<endOfText>
<bot>Now you can't really get a coherent staffing policy within a school in that kind of flux, whereas now people perhaps erm a bit too much at the opposite extreme but nevertheless erm do know that they're committed to being in the school and have a, therefore a commitment to it, a commitment to improving their own work and, and their collective work.<endOfText>
<human>Well, we are going to pick up, later in the series, erm at least two aspects that you've mentioned.<endOfText>
<bot>erm Professor Ron Dore is going to talk a bit about when education should stop and I suspect will be saying some of the things that you've already hinted at, and then later on Professor Colin Lacey will be talking about some aspects of teachers and teaching and training of teachers, and I suspect he will have something to say about mobility of teachers and careers of teachers as, as well.<endOfText>
<human>Let's move on to the medium-term question and get away from the perhaps the more depressing end of this time spectrum at any rate.<endOfText>
<bot>erm You said that this is largely a question of, of social circumstances, accountability, erm?<endOfText>
<human>That kind of thing.<endOfText>
<bot>There was a time, I think, in the late sixties, when erm the education service did itself very little good by going along with the general mythology that you had only to put more money into the schools to service, to solve all social problems.<endOfText>
<human>The over-optimism of that became very clear erm in the mid-seventies, and people all over the world, not just in this country, began saying, ‘What are we doing?<endOfText>
<bot>Why are we putting such huge proportions of our gross national product into schooling when it doesn't seem actually to resolve the worst social problems, it doesn't seem to erm improve erm greatly the prospects of employment and so on.’<endOfText>
<human>Well, education having been oversold in that way, erm the pendulum swung very strongly in the opposite direction, and I think, for a while, starting with the so-called ‘Great Debate’ under James Callaghan, education became very undersold.<endOfText>
<bot>People kept saying, ‘Oh, well, the schools have got to justify everything they do to the public, they've got to be accountable.’<endOfText>
<human>erm And certainly the work which Julia Knight and Michael Eraut and I were involved in, those two will be talking of course later in the series, brought out some of the problems that were generated by that atmosphere of distrust.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that's greatly improving now, partly because I think the schools have adopted a very responsible attitude towards it, on the whole.<endOfText>
<human>They haven't said, ‘Oh, well, we're not going to tell you anything,’ but they haven't either erm gone overboard as the American schools, many of them, have done, into becoming simply the ephemeral erm products of local opinion.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that that trend is, on the whole, a fairly healthy one, and it's meant the schools have begun to be far more conscious about their responsibilities, not just in general, but, but about particular responsibilities, erm responsibilities such as erm dealing more effectively with handicapped pupils, dealing with ethnic minorities and so on, again erm issues which other people in the series will be talking about.<endOfText>
<human>erm I remember that a friend of mine was involved in the work of the Plowden Committee which, as you know, Brian, was dealing with erm teaching in primary schools, and erm was asked by the Ford Foundation to work with a small team in America spreading the ideas discussed in the Plowden Report in the States.<endOfText>
<bot>And the whole thing was really a dismal flop because the context was so very different, the expectations were different, the kinds of things that you were saying.<endOfText>
<human>So you're really sounding a note of warning over translating or transferring one set of norms from one culture to another without being really rather cautious about it .<endOfText>
<bot>In some aspects.<endOfText>
<human>Of course there's another erm respect in which education systems all over the world behave in an uncannily similar way.<endOfText>
<bot>erm The fashions that sweep through different countries, educational technology was one, the independent learning movement was another, those kinds of fashions seem to know no frontiers, and one finds arguments being repeated in Stockholm very much as they were advanced in erm Brighton or in Tokyo or in other places.<endOfText>
<human>Moving on to your third point, the long-term aspects of education, you said these are largely demographic?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I was erm trying to point out that the most stable element in a sense in a very changing system is pupil numbers, because you always know, pretty well exactly, how many pupils you are going to have at any given time.<endOfText>
<human>And you know some years in advance if you're in a secondary school erm that the total secondary school population is going to drop by, say, erm fifteen per cent in the next five years or whatever it might be.<endOfText>
<bot>Now of course you can't predict at the level of the individual school what the population is going to be, but you can nevertheless be very clear that the system as a whole is going to have many erm fewer pupils.<endOfText>
<human>Of course nobody knows whether that downward curve is going to start going upward again or how fast it is starting to go upward.<endOfText>
<bot>erm There are one or two people who have just begun to identify a faint movement back into an increase in numbers, but over very many years you can know pretty well exactly where you are as far as the total number of pupils you have to provide for is concerned, and therefore, in that sense, the system can plan its resources for a known population.<endOfText>
<human>Well, that sounds as if it's the sort of thing that ought to happen.<endOfText>
<bot>erm I just sometimes wonder whether the numbers erm are right.<endOfText>
<human>erm I remember a few years ago when there was a great panicky shutting down of teachers' training colleges.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, alas, in that particular case, there was a panicky policy, because they delayed drawing the proper consequences from their data for too long.<endOfText>
<human>In fact erm there are now, you could say, too many teachers in the system overall, and that's why there are new proposals erm both in the colleges and in the universities to cut back on the number of teachers that are being trained.<endOfText>
<bot>You've got, again, a much more stable population, there aren't nearly so many teachers, young women teachers who leave the system to get married and then perhaps don't go back at all, or only go back on a part-time basis.<endOfText>
<human>erm The whole nature of the stock of teachers has changed and on, I'm afraid, anybody's reckoning, there are rather too many of them.<endOfText>
<bot>What do you consider to be the encouraging trends in education these days?<endOfText>
<human>What's really happening that's good?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I think, it is this much greater caring for detail, for individuality.<endOfText>
<human>In expansion, erm people were interested in getting bigger schools, getting more teachers, getting more pupils, getting more resources, and on the whole they tended to forget the individuality at the expense of the large numbers.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, partly I think as a result of the numbers being fewer, but partly as a result of simply a greater awareness of need, I think, the schools are more caring places, they do try erm not to treat erm minority groups as just annoying variants on the majority group, they try to erm think through their problems and to help to meet them.<endOfText>
<human>And that, I think, is, in humane terms, perhaps the most important thing that's, that's happening in education today.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you very much, Tony.<endOfText>
<human>Well, that's all that we have time for today.<endOfText>
<bot>Next week I shall be talking to Dr Johanna <endOfText>
<human>Hello.<endOfText>
<bot>This is another programme in our series from the University, in which we share with you news and views concerning activities that are going on here.<endOfText>
<human>In these programmes, we're talking with people in the community who have particular contacts with us.<endOfText>
<bot>And Graham Mayhew, who is my guest today, is a particularly good example of somebody who has contact with us at all sorts of different levels.<endOfText>
<human>Graham, I want to start by asking you about you being Mayor.<endOfText>
<bot>You look far too young to be a Mayor, but you've just finished being Mayor for Lewes.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I was the youngest ever Mayor of Lewes by a clear ten years, I'm the only one who's ever been Mayor in his twenties, and I think that came about probably because the family had been in the town since the beginning of the century, erm and I'd been involved in local politics since about eight or nineteen, I was on polling stations and so on.<endOfText>
<bot>And so when I got elected to the Council I think one or two people at any rate felt that it was quite natural that I should have the opportunity fairly soon.<endOfText>
<human>And so you were the youngest ever Mayor of Lewes?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>The previous youngest was thirty-eight when he took over, and I was twenty-eight.<endOfText>
<bot>Well that's, as you say, a record by ten years.<endOfText>
<human>Did you actually enjoy being Mayor?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes, I mean it's tremendous fun actually, because it's one of those jobs which you can make more or less whatever you want out of.<endOfText>
<human>And providing you're sort of enthusiastic enough and you actually put the time in and the effort, then people respond.<endOfText>
<bot>What are the things that you introduced that were different from previous Mayors?<endOfText>
<human>Last year was the centenary of the Borough Charter.<endOfText>
<bot>So on the one hand I was trying to restore the traditions of the thing.<endOfText>
<human>erm We tried to reintroduce some of the pomp and ceremonial.<endOfText>
<bot>And then on the other hand, I felt that the mayoralty often didn't seem terribly relevant to people of my generation, and so I tried to involve a lot of young people in various activities, and the offshoot of that has been a Youth Advisory Committee which I set up, which at the moment is in the process of trying to negotiate with the County Council for some premises to try and increase the sort of youth club type evening provision in the town.<endOfText>
<human>Well, my son Andrew was involved with some of these discussions erm What I didn't learn firsthand, myself, I learnt secondhand from him.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that's an absolutely excellent idea to involve the younger people.<endOfText>
<human>Do you, do you regard your efforts in that direction as being successful?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, it's really too early to say.<endOfText>
<human>I think it's been successful in trying to break down barriers a bit, and I think at least some of the representatives erm the head boy and girl and deputy head boy and girl at Priory School and some of the people from Rings School and so on at least have contact now on a fairly regular basis with local councillors, local council officials and so on .<endOfText>
<bot>I think it enables young, the young people that have been coming to those meetings to find out too the problems that councillors have and local authorities have, in actually trying to carry out the sorts of things they want.<endOfText>
<human>For example, on the building that we're talking about shifting, first of all we've got to find a site for the thing, then we've got to get planning permission, then we've got to get the actual permission of the owner of the land, then we've got to make sure that erm electricity's laid on, that there's erm water laid on, that there's some sort of toilet or other facilities and so on , and when you add all that lot up, it's quite a complicated sort of series of bureaucratic procedures you've got to go through, and it's not a question of, you know, of people saying to us, ‘Well, as councillors, well, do this for us,’ and we can magic it out in six months out of thin air.<endOfText>
<bot>There's an awful lot of paperwork that's got to be gone through, an awful lot of people to see, an awful lot of red tape really to get through, first, I mean just to make sure that the thing's safe and complies with health and safety standards.<endOfText>
<human>And that's something which you have to get across to young people, and if they're involved in the actual discussions on this, they're involved in the organisation, they begin to see the complexities, and they're less inclined to think, to automatically assume that erm people aren't on their side and don't want to listen.<endOfText>
<bot>And of course Lewes is a small enough town that it's possible for ordinary people to be involved in, in central activities like council activities and so on.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I think it's a small enough town for people to get to know who their representatives are, to get to know each other, to get to know who runs which societies and organisations in the town, and that creates a sort of an area of erm communal feeling that you don't get in a place that's say five or six times as big.<endOfText>
<bot>You know, Lewes is about the right sort of size for that, people don't get too much on top of each other, but at least they can find their way around.<endOfText>
<human>I know that you're a historian by profession.<endOfText>
<bot>Did this allow you to reintroduce, rediscover old traditions in Lewes that had been lost?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I mean I run a series for one of the local newspapers on past Lewes mayors, and the amount of work that I had to do for that meant that I picked up all sorts of pieces of information about what other mayors had tried in the past, and things that had been successful and things that had been disasters, and as it was a centenary, I went to a lot of trouble to look up exactly what had happened a hundred years ago, and to try and recreate the ceremonial connected with that.<endOfText>
<bot>And then when we elected erm two people Honorary Freemen of the town, erm I got in all of the other mayors from Sussex, asked them to come along with their robes and their mace-bearers and so on, and we had this very sort of grand ceremonial procession in the assembly hall which was packed house of about four hundred people.<endOfText>
<human>My only regret on that particular occasion now is that I didn't organise properly getting it videotaped, because it would have been a nice thing to keep, but as far as I could I kept to the traditions of mayoral ceremonial on those sorts of occasions.<endOfText>
<bot>erm Lewes has only had a mayoralty for a hundred years, and so its ceremonial is somewhat new, but one was able to draw on the traditions in places like Rye where it goes back to the thirteenth, fourteenth centuries and erm I used some of the phraseologies out of sixteenth century Rye documents and so on in my Lewes mayoralty on these sorts of ceremonial occasions, and introduced some of the ceremonial which I knew was authentic to mayoralties elsewhere in Sussex.<endOfText>
<human>And I think it, it sort of paid off in making people feel in the town during the year that they had a Mayor, that the ceremonial actually meant something and related to them.<endOfText>
<bot>And certainly I still find tremendous numbers of people who sort of come along and invite you to things, people who before would have probably said, ‘Oh, it's a waste of money,’ and I think we did quite a lot to, to change that attitude.<endOfText>
<human>Why is it that mayors only existed in Lewes for a hundred years, seeing it's such an old town?<endOfText>
<bot>Primarily because the town's basically a Saxon foundation.<endOfText>
<human>It's sort of gridiron pattern streets on the south side of the High Street.<endOfText>
<bot>On the north side, that's all disrupted by the Castle, and as far as one can tell, when the town and the area around it, the  of Lewes was ceded to William de Warren, most of the local powers of the town council, such as it was, were taken away and subverted, and the town became a manorial borough.<endOfText>
<human>Now that sent Members of Parliament to Westminster from the end of the thirteenth century.<endOfText>
<bot>It only had a very sort of ramshackle corporation because the lords of the manor of Lewes kept control fairly tightly on what the town was actually allowed to do and on its internal freedoms.<endOfText>
<human>Although there was a sort of mediaeval corporation it didn't have the royal charter, and so in the end of the seventeenth century it was somewhat subverted and really there was no proper town government to speak of until the beginning of the nineteenth century with the borough commissioners and then later on with the Mayor and Corporation which was set up in 1881.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, you are  you've obviously studied your local history very closely and I believe you actually run local history classes, don't you?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I've got four going at the moment  actually, it's rather ludicrous really.<endOfText>
<bot>I've got one in Battle on Tudor Battle , all about the dissolution of Battle Abbey and erm what happened to the town afterwards, one on Elizabethan Rye, which is erm was notable because it was the largest place in Sussex at the time, very important port, lot of trade for London went to Rye, and there's a lot of stuff relating to piracy and erm warfare.<endOfText>
<human>For example, in fifteen fifty-seven, eight, when Queen Mary lost Calais to the French, the income of the town corporation doubled in that year from three hundreds pounds to six hundred and that's entirely because they pulled in an awful lot of French boats and then charged them all a lot of ransom money before they sent them back to France.<endOfText>
<bot>So that sort of thing's quite fun.<endOfText>
<human>erm I've got courses in Eastbourne and erm a course in Brighton on mediaeval stained glass in fact.<endOfText>
<bot>I've always enjoyed teaching, it's something which I feel is very important for somebody who's a historian, I don't like just doing research without communicating.<endOfText>
<human>And I think if you've got an interest and you can communicate it well to people, then it stimulates their enjoyment, and of course in a time when there's going to have to be more and more leisure, I think that's very important.<endOfText>
<bot>And you're doing these courses under the aegis of the Centre for Continuing Education at the University?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, that's right.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean erm the second main paymaster of myself you know is the University in fact and erm without them I don't suppose I could have sort of financed the extra side of sort of clothing everything else for my mayoralty.<endOfText>
<human>And do I understand that there's a, a day school planned in the near future?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, I've got a day school on December the fourth, it's a Saturday, it's all day from ten o'clock to about five.<endOfText>
<human>We're going to be looking at Lewes in the period during the late middle ages, early modern period when it had an unchartered corporation, how the town was governed and so on.<endOfText>
<bot>We're going to be looking at erm the contrast between and places like Rye, which did have a chartered corporation, and we're going to be looking at sort of trade, at the effects of epidemics on the town erm and so on.<endOfText>
<human>I should think it should be great fun.<endOfText>
<bot>And you don't have to have a history degree to come along to one of these things?<endOfText>
<human>No, we don't expect any background knowledge at all.<endOfText>
<bot>And details can be got from the Centre for Continuing Education at the University.<endOfText>
<human>I'm sure if anyone wrote in they would be sent an appropriate form.<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>How much does it cost?<endOfText>
<bot>I think it's six pounds fifty for the erm for the day.<endOfText>
<human>They have to buy their own lunch in the University Refectory, but that's an experience in itself, so anybody who wants to come and play student for the day, it's, it's great fun.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, that sounds something to recommend for that December Saturday.<endOfText>
<human>erm Looking at other aspects of your life and work, your official history activities are with the East Sussex Record Office at Pelham House.<endOfText>
<bot>That's right, yes, I run the Search Room there, which means that erm people come in to Pelham House, they usually meet me at a desk on the end of a telephone and I put them onto the documents that they want to look at and I make sure they're ordered up from where they're kept in one of the various repositories and strongrooms that we've got, and then I produce them for them and erm if they need any help reading them and so on I give them that.<endOfText>
<human>And are most of the documents in Sussex now kept in the East Sussex Record Office?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, there are two record offices for Sussex, there's the East Sussex one, under the East Sussex County Council in Lewes, and the West Sussex Record Office at Chichester.<endOfText>
<human>An increasing number of official documents are being kept at record offices, all of the parish registers for the various East Sussex parishes are now held, with one exception, at Lewes.<endOfText>
<bot>erm All of the local authority records, as far as we've been able to get them in, are held there.<endOfText>
<human>We're trying at the moment to get in Nonconformist church records, or at least to get copies of them if the churches don't want to let us have them, because they're quite important for the nineteenth century history of East Sussex, and erm really any help that erm that we can get from the general public who've got old documents relating to their properties, minutes of any organisations that they've been involved in or that used to exist and that's now collapsed, anything like that that can add to the history of the county, we're always very grateful to receive.<endOfText>
<bot>And again, the Record Office is something that lay folk can just come in and look up books and ask questions if they wish to.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, it's open Mondays to Fridays from quarter to nine through to quarter to five, and anyone can just walk in and we'll do our best to help them and produce whatever it is they want to see, providing we've got it and we can find it.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I've actually spent some hours in the Record Office, I don't think while you've been there, erm doing a bit of ancestor hunting, so I am familiar with your, your work and activities.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, well anybody can come in and trace their family so long as they know that they came from Sussex at some point and they've got some, something to work on, they've got some idea of which town or which village they came from.<endOfText>
<bot>Then usually the parish registers and things like the census returns over the last hundred years are usually able to help them.<endOfText>
<human>One other contact that I think you have with us is that you sing in the Meeting House choir.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, yes.<endOfText>
<human>I hadn't actually managed to make it yet this term because of all the teaching preparation I've been doing but erm I've done that for the last two years and erm it's been quite an important activity because it enabled me, after I came back down to Lewes, to help to get to know a few people in the University and to sort of expand my contacts.<endOfText>
<bot>And the Meeting House is one of those places which is open to the general public on Sundays for religious worship, there's a Catholic service at half past ten and an interdenominational one at half past eleven.<endOfText>
<human>There's a choir which produces, sings various mediaeval and erm Renaissance and eighteenth century anthems and so on, and they do a Christmas Carol Service and so on , and it's really quite, I find it quite nice to come to, because it doesn't have the sort of narrow denominationalism that many of the local churches have.<endOfText>
<bot>You've got experience of being at two other universities, you've did your undergraduate work at York and then you did a doctorate at Oxford.<endOfText>
<human>How do you find Sussex compares with those two?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, it's difficult really.<endOfText>
<human>erm Architecturally I suppose it doesn't compare with a mediaeval university.<endOfText>
<bot>I liked York very much, because it was set round a lake and erm it was the first one I went to, but I must say that of the other modern universities that I know I would say that Sussex was erm was the other best one that I've been to and the one that I've felt most erm comfortable and happy in.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you very much, Graham.<endOfText>
<bot>Next week we shall have another member of the local community as our guest.<endOfText>
<human>Until next week then, goodbye.<endOfText>
<bot>Good evening.<endOfText>
<human>This programme comes to you from the University of Sussex.<endOfText>
<bot>You could say that everyone at the University is involved in education, at least in the broader sense.<endOfText>
<human>But there are groups within the University that have been given specific responsibility for certain elements, and the largest of these is the Education Area.<endOfText>
<bot>Professor Norman Mackenzie is Chairman of Education.<endOfText>
<human>I asked him to explain how the Area relates to the rest of the University.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, it's erm a very small section of the University compared to Arts or Science erm in fact there are only twenty-five teaching members of faculty involved in education, but I think it's a pretty important erm part of the University.<endOfText>
<human>It's a part of the University that has quite a lot of contact with the community in Sussex.<endOfText>
<bot>This is a, a helpful and reciprocal relationship because our students, who are in our Postgraduate Certificate of Education course, that's university graduates who are training to be teachers, do go out into schools in this area and do their teaching practice in those schools in a rather interesting way and we developed a scheme, here in Sussex, which was quite novel when we started it about ten years ago.<endOfText>
<human>The students go out and spend part of each week all through the school year in the schools, and the teachers in those schools, whether they are science teachers or history teachers or English teachers, collaborate with us in helping to train those students.<endOfText>
<bot>And they come back into the University two days a week.<endOfText>
<human>So there's a reciprocal relationship with quite a number of schools in this area of a rather novel and to us extremely helpful and rewarding kind.<endOfText>
<bot>What do you do for existing teachers?<endOfText>
<human>We're very much involved in what's called in-service training, in the retraining and helping of teachers who've been in the profession for some years, and who need to get new qualifications or refreshment in their professional work.<endOfText>
<bot>And that of course is quite erm an important part of our work.<endOfText>
<human>The in-service kind of erm activity is of course reflected in our, many of our courses, not merely in short courses, but in the fact that we run erm Masters courses, erm M As in Education of several kinds, and students in those courses are mainly teachers who have been released for a whole year to come and do a full-time course.<endOfText>
<bot>But there again we have part-time courses for the M A and the in-service B Ed for teachers who live in the Sussex region and can study part-time.<endOfText>
<human>And then we have research students erm who are doing M Phils, Masters of Philosophy, or D Phils, Doctors of Philosophy, and erm research with us.<endOfText>
<bot>And that adds up, one way and another, to about two hundred and forty students who are erm working with us at any given time.<endOfText>
<human>What are the other responsibilities of the Education Area?<endOfText>
<bot>It includes at present what we call the School of Education.<endOfText>
<human>We don't want to get too much into these complicated terms, but the School of Education is the link between the University and other institutions of higher education like Brighton Polytechnic and the West Sussex Institute of Education as it now is, and of course, up to now, colleges at Eastbourne like Chelsea and the Eastbourne College of Education.<endOfText>
<bot>And all the students in those colleges that are studying education have been doing so for awards at the University of Sussex, so we're actually a much bigger family than the students we have here on the site at Thelma .<endOfText>
<human>Altogether, in round figures, there are about three thousand students taking education awards at the moment.<endOfText>
<bot>That number regrettably is shrinking because the cutback in teacher training, but up to now there is a very considerable interchange between the University and the Polytechnic and the colleges, at the level of initial teacher training, as well as cooperation in in-service work.<endOfText>
<human>Presumably there is research in education, too.<endOfText>
<bot>We have a rather significant research effort.<endOfText>
<human>If I can put it in, not, I hope, in a boastful way, but to illustrate how important this is to us, about forty per cent, getting on for half of the income of the Education Area last year, was made up not of normal University funds, but of funds attracted from outside to support research from private foundations and from government departments like the Department of Education and Science.<endOfText>
<bot>And we have therefore a very substantial and helpful research as well.<endOfText>
<human>Do you train teachers for both primary and secondary schools?<endOfText>
<bot>We are, on the whole, training teachers for middle and secondary schools.<endOfText>
<human>We do have a small number who come to us to do primary training, but it's erm it's one group only, and it's always been a rather special group.<endOfText>
<bot>We don't cater to a large number of students intending to do first school work, it's, our main interest has been in the middle and secondary school areas.<endOfText>
<human>Are there any special features about the way Sussex trains its teachers?<endOfText>
<bot>Where I think we have tried to do something interesting is in this idea of giving the student a, a whole year's experience in the school to help them become professionalised, rather than the normal practice, the traditional practice of school practice, which meant going twelve, sixteen weeks into perhaps two bytes, into a school, and this does mean the student can get integrated with the school community and take part in the extramural life of the school, get involved in games and school plays and school outings in a way that's not possible if they're in and out on that short basis.<endOfText>
<human>But there is room for people, like myself for example, who have part interest in education, if I could put it that way, to spend some time working with you.<endOfText>
<bot>You have some people who are part-mathematicians, part-educationists for example <endOfText>
<human>That's true.<endOfText>
<bot>So you're not just a closed box of educationists.<endOfText>
<human>No, I think nobody would like that, either.<endOfText>
<bot>Sussex has had what I think is a, a very unusual and valuable aspect, and that is that, to some extent people find their own level in their own work in teaching.<endOfText>
<human>If something interests you, you're free to go and explore the possibilities of teaching it, and you aren't shut into these watertight boxes that you're in that department and can never get out of it.<endOfText>
<bot>And I think just as erm students of education draw, are taught by people from physics and mathematics and erm chemistry, just to take three examples right across the University, so several of us, in fact, do quite a lot of teaching in other areas of the University.<endOfText>
<human>I myself teach two history courses.<endOfText>
<bot>The erm other people teach in sociology courses, other people are teaching in erm courses in the Culture and Community Studies School on literature and history and social policy.<endOfText>
<human>So there is quite a, a, a movement across those frontiers.<endOfText>
<bot>Could you say a little bit more about the research going on in the Education Area?<endOfText>
<human>We've always tried to make our research projects pretty relevant to the real and contemporary problems of education.<endOfText>
<bot>For instance, we have a large-scale project erm at the moment which is concerned with falling numbers in secondary education and what should be done about them.<endOfText>
<human>This project, we're very pleased, is directed by Doctor Eric Briot , you may remember was the Chief Education Officer in London until he retired and came to lead this project, and a man of very great standing in education field, and what he's looking at is the effect of the falling school populations, which is already hitting primary schools, on these large comprehensives that we've created.<endOfText>
<bot>What's going to happen when the size of sixth forms shrinks?<endOfText>
<human>Can schools offer such a wide range of choice in the curriculum? erm Will we be able to maintain the erm the levels of staffing erm that's been possible so far?<endOfText>
<bot>And I think this is a pretty critical problem, and of course it's not only based on Sussex schools, but it's based on a number of schools throughout the country which we're studying to see the effects of this programme.<endOfText>
<human>There's another one that's very much concerned erm with the real situation in schools, we call it the Accountability Project, you realise that accountability is a rather a hot and fashionable word in education these days.<endOfText>
<bot>To whom is a school responsible and in what way?<endOfText>
<human>The relations between teachers and the parents and the school governs and the Local Education Authority.<endOfText>
<bot>And this one is a very interesting project because it's being done under the director of, direction of Dr. Michael Eraut in the University, but it involves not merely the University but the East Sussex County Council.<endOfText>
<human>We are actually partners with the Local Authority on erm this research project.<endOfText>
<bot>And we've had a great deal of helpful cooperation and it's very much erm going right into the schools, right into the whole system of government and control of the schools, erm and I think again is going to produce some very interesting results before too long.<endOfText>
<human>We've a third big project going at the moment, a very tricky one.<endOfText>
<bot>erm The Schools Council, erm as you may remember, has been putting millions of pounds into educational research over the last dozen years, and all kinds of new curriculum ideas and patterns of organisation have emerged.<endOfText>
<human>erm Professor Lacey, a colleague who is at the moment erm the research advisor of the Schools Council, has a project based here which is looking at the impact erm of these Schools Councils projects over the years, which ones have made an impact, which have fallen away, why some have succeeded, why others have fallen off.<endOfText>
<bot>And we are in fact looking at these projects to see that there is, or if there is, good, not merely ordinary value for money, but good educational value for money, and what might be learnt for the future.<endOfText>
<human>These, as Norman Mackenzie has said, are major projects in educational research.<endOfText>
<bot>And we shall be talking about them in detail in coming programmes.<endOfText>
<human>But there are many other interesting studies going on, concerned with all aspects and at all levels of education.<endOfText>
<bot>Stephen Ball has been investigating the differences between streamed and mixed ability classes in comprehensives.<endOfText>
<human>Again, we shall be hearing about his conclusions in another programme.<endOfText>
<bot>But this is what he had to say about one of the side effects that he noted.<endOfText>
<human>It seemed that the pupils in the mixed ability classes developed more slowly socially than the pupils in the streamed classes.<endOfText>
<bot>This was manifested in a number of ways, particularly in that pupils still in their second year in the mixed ability classes would be talking about playing with their friends, and generally their attitudes towards the teenage culture of pop music and magazines and fashions and discotheques didn't seem to develop so quickly as it had in the streamed situation.<endOfText>
<human>And I think really this comes from the problem of those pupils in the streamed situation, in the bottoms streams in particular, who found that they wanted alternatives to school, when the, they were in an inferior position in the school, they were devalued if you like by finding themselves in the bottom streams, and so they tended to look for out-of-school things, alternatives to school, from which to gain their satisfactions, and they would look to the pop media, to fashion, to football, to these kinds of things, and in the mixed ability situation this certainly did not happen in the same way.<endOfText>
<bot>So the, the children in a sense remained children longer in the mixed ability situation, and again this was something that the teachers found, found very pleasing, in that the, the pupils were remaining involved in the school much more and much longer.<endOfText>
<human>Carol Dyhouse has made a special study of women and education.<endOfText>
<bot>She will be taking part in a programme on this subject on March the twenty-ninth.<endOfText>
<human>But as a preview, this was her reply when I asked her whether the problem was, not whether women needed more education, but that men needed educating about women.<endOfText>
<bot>Men, perhaps, should be encouraged to realise that women want to speak up for themselves, they don't really like being told what they want by men.<endOfText>
<human>It's difficult, though, because if you talk to adolescent boys in schools they're violently opposed to women's liberation, they hate the name women's liberation, because they're very defensive perhaps about their own masculinity at that age, and their own masculinity is defined very much in terms of being superior to girls and having mums who wait on them at home.<endOfText>
<bot>So it's difficult to challenge that kind of supposition at that age.<endOfText>
<human>Later on, it's easier.<endOfText>
<bot>Boys need to be discouraged from assuming that they know what women's position is.<endOfText>
<human>I think it's, it really begins in the home, this, because mothers can do quite a lot in not educating their own sons to think of them as servants.<endOfText>
<bot>A lot of women do this, they're very tolerant about boys' mess in the home and untidiness generally, and in a sense they, they lay the foundations, right from the very beginning, of boys' growing up to think of women as kind of household servants.<endOfText>
<human>This attitude, you know, boys will be boys and they make a mess and poor Mum has to do all the washing, is really quite, quite misguided because it, it does encourage those assumptions that mothers are there to tidy up after sons, and of course then sons when they grow up and get wives want to replace their mothers.<endOfText>
<bot>So women themselves can do something about educating men in the home, starting with their sons.<endOfText>
<human>Talking to members of the Education Area about their researches, I was struck by the constructive relationships that they built up with the schools and groups that they studied.<endOfText>
<bot>Many of the projects arose not just because they seemed to be suitable topics for academic research, but at the direct instigation of teachers or sometimes students.<endOfText>
<human>The roles of the researcher were seen in terms of helping to identify, study, and solve an educational problem, with the fullest collaboration.<endOfText>
<bot>The premium was on being involved as a partner, or as an invited guest, rather than remaining as a detached outsider.<endOfText>
<human>Michael Eraut is concerned with evaluation in education, and had this to say.<endOfText>
<bot>In my mind, the object of doing an evaluation is to create some kind of improvement in the situation that is being evaluated.<endOfText>
<human>I'm not interested in producing reports and publications out of evaluation studies, I'm interested in affecting the situation, and affecting it to the mutual satisfaction of the people involved in it.<endOfText>
<bot>When I'm working with people on an evaluation or discussing evaluation in general, one of the major items of discussion always is, how can you consult other people, how can you get them involved?<endOfText>
<human>I say to them, ‘Look, don't start planning this whole thing on your own from the beginning.<endOfText>
<bot>Go round and talk to the various people you know that are interested and say to them ‘Look, I'm planning to try and do this work, but I don't just want to do this on my own, I want to take into account other people's views.’<endOfText>
<human>For example if I'm looking at O-level history, ‘What sorts of things do you think might be important, or what kinds of evidence do you think I ought to collect, or what issues do you think I ought to take into account?’’<endOfText>
<bot>So one tries to build up a kind of agenda of all the things that different people involved think might be important, before one tries to produce a plan as to how one's going to, to work.<endOfText>
<human>If people aren't interested in, in evaluation of something that concerns them, then nothing will happen at the end of it.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean there's no earthly use doing a beautiful piece of evaluation erm which no one wants to know about, and publishing something that has no effect.<endOfText>
<human>We've heard about the Education Area, but there is one very important unit that works largely in the wider community, and that is the Centre for Continuing Education.<endOfText>
<bot>I asked Professor Manny Eppell to describe the Centre's activities.<endOfText>
<human>What we try to do is to make available to people opportunities for study in depth and over a fairly long period of time, on issues and in subjects which are part of University activity.<endOfText>
<bot>Now it could be said of course that we don't offer the same kind of very intense opportunities that are on offer to undergraduates, but in some senses, and many adults have testified to this, this is an advantage, because it enables people in their own time, and sometimes over a fairly prolonged period, to explore with a tutor, a scholar, the kind of interests that they have in the issues that have concerned them in society.<endOfText>
<human>It also provides an opportunity, and I think this is quite important, for people to get to know what is happening within the fields of expertise, which increasingly in our society become more and more specialised, more and more hedged off from one another, and in a sense I think that there is a very great danger if intelligent adults in the community, laymen in effect, don't have some idea, some coherent idea, of what's going on in these fields of specialisation and expertise.<endOfText>
<bot>Now I'm sure you, Brian, would acknowledge that in a certain sense we are all laymen most of the time.<endOfText>
<human>However expert we may be in a fairly narrow field we are laymen to one another.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm a layman to you and you're a layman to me in many senses, and therefore erm the, the, the fact that our students are in effect very often laymen is not something that detracts from their motivation to study, in many instances it's something that gives it stimulus and underlines it.<endOfText>
<human>There's another aspect to what we do, and that is that I think we are part of a very powerful developing movement in education, and it is based on the concept that education should not stop with the terminal rituals of school and college, and that education should be as much part of life, wanting to know, to find out, to get to grips with the body of information and knowledge that's available in society.<endOfText>
<bot>And in a relatively small way, but when you think of the other universities doing the same sort of thing, in a larger way, we are offering this kind of opportunity to people.<endOfText>
<human>I think there's one other thing that's worth thinking about, and that is that many of our students come into the University for one-day schools, for lectures, for activities of this kind, and this gives an opportunity for a kind of reciprocal traffic, if you like, so that people outside who often have very odd ideas of what universities do and what they're about and what they're like, can actually see your University, participate in its activities, and we can see ordinary folk who sometimes ask the shrewdest questions and make sometimes what seem to be the most penetrating kinds of points about the sort of things that we take for granted.<endOfText>
<bot>Many of my tutors have said that one of the most salutary of their experiences has been to work with a good adult class, which starts with no preconceptions, doesn't necessarily have a qualification in mind, and ask the kind of questions which would tend to be asked say in Swift's Gulliver Travels.<endOfText>
<human>What, what appear to be, as I said, naive questions very often are most penetrating and bring us up short because they involve things we've taken for granted for many, many years and perhaps ought to look at again.<endOfText>
<bot>Could you give me an idea as to the size of the community which the Centre of Continuing Education covers, and also the number of courses and the students involved?<endOfText>
<human>That community, for historical reasons, happens at the moment to be East Sussex, the whole of East Sussex including Brighton, Eastbourne, Hastings and so on, and a substantial slice of West Sussex, so that our open community courses are available in these areas.<endOfText>
<bot>The bulk of them, incidentally, are not in the University, some are, but they are in places that students can get to after their work, or easily from their families and their towns and villages throughout the, the county.<endOfText>
<human>In what way did furnishing change during the fifties?<endOfText>
<bot>Apart from the fact that I think most people were able to afford a far bigger range of furnishings, for instance, the number of homes that actually had a carpet in the living room, there was very small percentage of people who could afford to have any sort of carpeting except for a small square of something in their living room.<endOfText>
<human>By the mid-sixties, you see, a large proportion of homes would have got fitted carpeting throughout, so there's that kind of difference.<endOfText>
<bot>There's also the introduction of actual new pieces of furniture, like the coffee table, which you don't find in pre-war homes except in very élite, grand houses, but this is almost a, a standard fitting in a living room now.<endOfText>
<human>Can you think of any reason why the coffee table should have suddenly become so popular?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I think it's, it's largely to do with the changed uses of the living room, because I think one of the, one of the changes that I found in, in the way that people organise the rooms within their house, is changing over from having a best parlour, usually in the front, which was very seldom used except for inviting the vicar in or whatever, or laying out the dead, combined with a back kitchen, a family room, where you ate and so on, and a move over to having one combined living-dining room where all the family's activities went on.<endOfText>
<human>And I think tied in with this is people inviting people into their homes more.<endOfText>
<bot>Also of course changes in actual eating habits.<endOfText>
<human>I think we tend to eat much faster, if you like, and, and to take more snacks, and I think it's interesting that the rise of the use of a coffee table ties in a lot with the rise of people having televisions in their front rooms, because introducing the television made all kinds of changes into, just the way people arrange their chairs, not centring them round the fire any more, and a coffee table's a very neat addition to that kind of arrangement.<endOfText>
<bot>To what extent do you extrapolate from looking at furnishings to social conditions?<endOfText>
<human>I think it's very hard to separate the two, but it's a big chicken and egg, to say which came first, the social conditions or the furnishings is erm is very hard to say, but they are, I mean like in that example that I just gave, they're very strongly tied up.<endOfText>
<bot>Social conditions certainly affected Mrs. Daisy Sawyer's choice of furnishing.<endOfText>
<human>She remembers setting up her first home, right after the war.<endOfText>
<bot>They were dockets that we had, after the war, to buy our furniture, because there wasn't much furniture around, we was only allowed so many per family.<endOfText>
<human>And once you spent those dockets, you just had to go and buy secondhand if you wanted any more.<endOfText>
<bot>There's quite a few around us because then we was not going onto a council estate from the one room, and we were all in the same boat together.<endOfText>
<human>We was all having a hard time, a rough time, and doing what we could to make our homes look respectable and nice for people to come into.<endOfText>
<bot>Helen, could you call this kind of personal recollection about furnishings a type of alternative history, perhaps like oral history?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, because this is describing, analysing how ordinary people lived, what was going on that enabled them to live in this way.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, it's a kind of history that history books are not usually written about.<endOfText>
<human>When you walk into a living room, what sort of clues do you get?<endOfText>
<bot>I get clues as to how a particular family organises its life, whether the room is a room for the whole family or a, a room that's perhaps excludes children or a room that's for best, that kind of  which not only tells you something about that particular family but, when you've seen enough homes, tells you about general patterns that are going on in social life.<endOfText>
<human>Do you find it easy to deduce class from looking at a living room?<endOfText>
<bot>No, I wouldn't say I did, and I wouldn't say that's what I was looking for, particularly, because again I mean it's a much abused notion that perhaps that class disappears in postwar Britain, I think that's a political issue that was an attempt to make it look as if class was disappearing, class differences rather, but I think there is a lot of evening out, there's not the stark differences of the quality of life of furnishings that you would have found say in homes before the war.<endOfText>
<human>Where do you do your research?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, part of it I've done in the Kent Town, East Brighton area.<endOfText>
<human>Particularly in the streets that have undergone a great deal of change since the war, like the street where I live myself, which is another thing that prompted me to, to go into the research in the first place, which is erm a house of small Victorian erm I believe the estate agents call them artisans' cottages , and this kind of area which, there's a great deal of this sort of property in Brighton, has undergone enormous changes since the war from being multi-occupied before the war, with one family on each floor, were regarded immediately after the war as slums and were scheduled for demolition, but they've been a great lease of life all over the country, this sort of property, and been subjected to a process which has come to be known as gentrification, which has meant that when the middle class couldn't afford to, to buy semi-detached in suburbs they took to buying this kind of smaller property in town centres, thereby introducing a whole new element into streets that had never seen these, this kind of things done to houses before.<endOfText>
<bot>Are people generally willing to let you into their houses?<endOfText>
<human>It varies a great deal.<endOfText>
<bot>I think older people are quite naturally rather anxious, and they're also rather puzzled as to why people should be interested in what their homes were like, now or twenty years ago.<endOfText>
<human>But on the whole once I've got talking it's been very successful, and people are always amazed at what they do remember in great detail about how they got things, why they got them, when they got them, and I think by and large the people that I have talked to have found it very interesting to do for themselves as well as for me.<endOfText>
<bot>Generally what reasons did people give for choosing furniture?<endOfText>
<human>An enormous variety of reasons, and  by and large not the sort of reasons that advertisers would hope that they did give.<endOfText>
<bot>I think again the sort of picture that you get from books is rather like a stage set, with everything new from the year nineteen fifty-eight or whatever, all bundled into a room together, this is what it looked like.<endOfText>
<human>Well, of course, real homes don't look like that at all and the way that their things are accumulated is not like that.<endOfText>
<bot>erm A lot of people gave as a reason for getting a particular piece of furniture the fact that it was given to them by their parents when they got married, or that a neighbour was trying to get rid of it, or that somebody from work had passed it on and they needed one.<endOfText>
<human>When it came to new furnishings, people usually they found it difficult to say why apart from‘I got it because I liked it’, or ‘I got it because it was cheap’.<endOfText>
<bot>Who in the homes made the furnishing decisions?<endOfText>
<human>Well this provided some very interesting information I think, because I was very surprised the degree to which men were involved in decisions about what to put in the home and had very strong opinions about quite small details of colour and this kind of thing as to what went into the home.<endOfText>
<bot>But there did seem to be some pattern by which certain objects were very much considered the wife's province.<endOfText>
<human>I mean I didn't find any husbands going out and choosing lampshades, for instance, or they weren't particularly bothered about the colour of curtains.<endOfText>
<bot>It's the kind of objects that get changed more frequently, and particularly those to do with colour, were mainly the wife's decisions.<endOfText>
<human>But obviously the heavier pieces of furniture, the more durable ones, are also the more expensive, and when it's largely the money for them's going to come out of the husband's pocket they're going to have more of a stake in erm  in saying what they want.<endOfText>
<bot>And the kind of criticisms split down the middle, as well,on furnishings, that by and large men were far more concerned about the, the lack of durability in modern furnishings compared with their parents', whereas women weren't so concerned with that.<endOfText>
<human>Generally, have you discovered any particular changes in Brighton's home furnishing over the past generation?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, I'd say there was a definite move towards the same kinds of objects, the same kinds of styles and qualities of furniture being found in a wide variety of income groups, areas of the town, different types of houses, a much more over-all feel, really, a move towards classlessness I suppose you could call it.<endOfText>
<human>The fact that a very similar kind of furniture can be bought in an enormous variety of different places, there's not this same idea that ‘Oh, I wouldn't ever go in that sort of shop to buy it because it's not a place for my sort of person’.<endOfText>
<bot>In addition to becoming less class-distinct, homes generally got more comfortable as well, didn't they?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I think one of the main things that, that made this possible was the improvements in heating.<endOfText>
<bot>Heating for instance in more than just one room, which for instance became standard in council house building in the late forties onwards.<endOfText>
<human>The move towards much more efficient methods of heating like convector heaters right on through to central heating, so that you could use more just that back parlour where the cooker was that kept the place warm.<endOfText>
<bot>For instance bedrooms, much more use of bedrooms for actually living, particularly for children, although I think that is one of the few instances where you can discover class patterns if you like.<endOfText>
<human>That in lower income groups, not because you couldn't afford to heat the bedrooms, but there's a definite idea that bedrooms are for sleeping in, rather than living in.<endOfText>
<bot>What direction do you see your research taking you in?<endOfText>
<human>Well it's hard to know where to stop, really  erm I mean the, the difficulty of concentrating on  one area of the country, is that we're of course I think there must be very great differences in different areas of the country.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank very much to Helen Martin and Mrs. Daisy Sawyer.<endOfText>
<human>Next week on Ideas in Action we'll pay a visit to the Brighton Youth Orchestra, and <endOfText>
<bot>take you back in this first talk about the art of film erm to the very early days, and these are difficult I think for us to imagine because we're so used today to sound films, of all the effects in, in the theatres, we're used to the great stars, we're used to the big subjects, and yet the film began in the smallest possible way, it began really as a sideshow, it began as a hobby for a group of people, sometimes they would be French, sometimes they would be British, sometimes American, the early pioneers, whose main interest was to produce a camera, which would look like a still camera and yet somehow would manage to produce a picture which moved when it was projected on a screen.<endOfText>
<human>So the first people who made films, the first people who invented the apparatus by means of which they could be made, were relatively simple showmen or photographers, or in certain cases like Edison, erm the, you know a professional inventor, who would use either his staff to develop a piece of apparatus, or would do it himself.<endOfText>
<bot>And this is really why the beginning of cinema is an international thing.<endOfText>
<human>Because now one man, now another would produce some part of what became in the end the motion picture camera.<endOfText>
<bot>Now you may say ‘Why on earth talk about this sort of thing on Brighton Radio?’<endOfText>
<human>Well, there's a very good reason for this because as it happens erm Brighton was a filmmaking centre in the very earliest days.<endOfText>
<bot>erm There was one particularly noted filmmaker, a man called George Albert Smith, who worked in Brighton, but there were others too, there was a man called John Bennett Stanford and another called Esmé Collings.<endOfText>
<human>And Brighton, strange as it may seem, became, in Britain, one of the small pioneer centres where these first movies were made.<endOfText>
<bot>Now one has to get this picture into some sort of perspective against, as I said, the big films of today.<endOfText>
<human>These men, all of them, were people who first of all were devoted to their cameras.<endOfText>
<bot>Some of them actually made their own cameras, and even more strangely, used the cameras to project the films after they had made them.<endOfText>
<human>In the daytime they would shoot erm with their apparatus, the short strips of film, in say the streets of the towns where they were, and then in the evening they would use the same apparatus adapted to project the films onto a screen.<endOfText>
<bot>And the kind of thing they made of course erm were just short moments of motion, short silent films which showed action which lasted about a minute.<endOfText>
<human>It might be a scene in the High Street, or it might be some particular local personality who it would entertain the people to see in the evening, erm their faces on the screen.<endOfText>
<bot>They couldn't hear any speech.<endOfText>
<human>erm These films could only just run and show the faces, show the expressions, show a little action.<endOfText>
<bot>And this really was the basis therefore of the first films, they were really demonstrations that pictures could move, and this was sufficient for people to pay a few pence to come in erm and look at the films.<endOfText>
<human>Now this was the kind of man that George Albert Smith of Brighton was, and he made a whole range of short films, as all the early filmmakers did, erm publishing a catalogue every so often, and offering his films for sale to other showmen, because as the years passed erm these films became extremely popular.<endOfText>
<bot>Now we're dealing with the year about eighteen ninety-six onwards, and the filmmakers of this time erm would make this large number of short films, make several in a day if they had the, if the, they had the opportunity and the subjects, and then they would print catalogues of these pictures and market them.<endOfText>
<human>Market them not only in this country but abroad.<endOfText>
<bot>It became quite big business.<endOfText>
<human>Now I remember it was about oh twenty years ago that Rachel Low, the daughter of celebrated cartoonist, and I, we were both on the staff of the British Film Institute then, erm decided we would write the early history of British film.<endOfText>
<bot>And we travelled down to Brighton from London and met in his home George Albert Smith, who was then in his nineties, a charming old man, very good-looking, and very, very interested to share his experiences of the past with us, and I remember he showed us his account books.<endOfText>
<human>And there it was, in the late nineties, he was adding up his pence and his shillings and the odd pound or two here and there, these were his costs of making the pictures that he was making in those days, and then when you turned over and we came to nineteen hundred, nineteen hundred and one, nineteen hundred and two, erm the figures had broadened and under the pounds into three figures and then into four.<endOfText>
<bot>And this was what kind of business filmmaking became.<endOfText>
<human>It was a matter of very small beginnings for everybody, and then as the pictures that they made became more and more popular, more and more acceptable, used not merely in fairgrounds or in odd corners of shops and this sort of thing, for the odd fifteen minutes or twenty minutes of movie, but entered into the music halls, became one of the acts in the music hall entertainment erm this really was the foundation of a new industry, a new industry of entertainment, a new industry of information.<endOfText>
<bot>This was the background to it all.<endOfText>
<human>George Albert Smith was later of course erm to come on and make a big name, a world name for himself as the inventor of the first colour process, a very simple, two-colour process, but it was invented by him in Brighton, and it was the first world colour process.<endOfText>
<bot>And it was patented erm in nineteen hundred and six, and was called Kinemakolour .<endOfText>
<human>And in nineteen hundred and eight, erm this Kinemakolour was put on the market with a special company and erm Smith in nineteen hundred and eight was awarded a silver medal by the Royal Society of Arts erm for his invention.<endOfText>
<bot>And this colour process was to be used erm Delhi Durbar for example was, was filmed in colour by Smith, and this marvellous colour process, at least marvellous for its day, erm was known everywhere.<endOfText>
<human>Unfortunately it resulted in a patent war, and finally by the mid-teens, about nineteen fifteen, erm the process died as a result of the rivalries of other companies.<endOfText>
<bot>Nonetheless, George Albert Smith's name stands as the inventor of a colour process which was viable, which was shown worldwide, and which presented for the first time on the screen a photographically produced colour picture.<endOfText>
<human>All the others had been hand-tinted or hand-painted, and this after all was not the real thing.<endOfText>
<bot>So this was another reason for his, his place in film history.<endOfText>
<human>Now you may wonder the kind of films these early pioneers made.<endOfText>
<bot>I've mentioned one or two kinds of very simple films, but of course they soon became much more erm elaborate in a, in a simple way elaborate.<endOfText>
<human>They lasted much longer, they lasted five or ten minutes.<endOfText>
<bot>erm Some were what we would call nowadays newsreels.<endOfText>
<human>Some of these newsreels I might say were faked, I don't mean George Albert Smith's were faked, but erm there was for example the case erm of the Boer War.<endOfText>
<bot>The Boer War was on and the first sort of major conflict erm in the period of movie history, and naturally people wanted to see what the war was like.<endOfText>
<human>So it was much easier if you hadn't got a lot of money to fake some action, and produce some fake Boer war newsreels than to do the real thing.<endOfText>
<bot>So I'm afraid that some were faked and some were real.<endOfText>
<human>And this was to be the case with a lot of actuality pictures of the time.<endOfText>
<bot>Nonetheless it was news really which brought people in beyond the mere curiosity of seeing pictures that moved, brought people in erm to these early shows.<endOfText>
<human>They wanted to see a battleship launched, they wanted to see Royalty in action, they wanted to see anything that was happening which was an event in the world, and so cameramen like George Albert Smith, and eventually George Albert Smith's staff, would go out around the world, much as it would happen now but in a much simpler way, erm to make actuality pictures.<endOfText>
<bot>And in the course of time they began to make simple documentaries erm which would be something say the study of Pekin, if you happened to go there, or Italy if you happened to go, any country that to which you could go, you went and you made not just newsreels but also erm documentary studies of these films, of these places.<endOfText>
<human>That is they would really be the beginnings of what we would now call travelogues.<endOfText>
<bot>Travelogues were immensely popular, people hadn't the resources to travel in those days easily unless they were wealthy, and here was a chance to see what the world was like in various places that were inaccessible erm to the average member of the audience.<endOfText>
<human>And then there were the vaudeville films.<endOfText>
<bot>films which featured, although you couldn't hear their voices unfortunately yet, featured erm famous singers and artists of, of the variety stage.<endOfText>
<human>They would be featured and then a live player with a piano or what have you erm would produce the music which went with the action on, on the screen.<endOfText>
<bot>And then there were trick films.<endOfText>
<human>Now the trick films came particularly out of the pioneers' own attitude to their apparatus.<endOfText>
<bot>erm If you were not so much an artist as a technician, you became as a technician interested in what this camera of yours could do, and therefore George Albert Smith, who was primarily I would say a technical man rather than an artist, he was very interested in the trick film.<endOfText>
<human>Now trick films were the sort of first visual magic that the cinema could produce and erm these, these films you would see for example a motor car disintegrate and then reassemble itself, this kind of thing, people's clothes change, drop off and a new set of garments would come on, all this sort of thing, people's faces would change, their environment would change, their chairs would collapse under them and rebuild themselves, this sort of thing which could be done relatively easily once you knew how to do it.<endOfText>
<bot>And the trick films were these, in a sense, the magic comedy form which erm these early films took.<endOfText>
<human>They were very, very popular and went all over the world.<endOfText>
<bot>Well these were the main films.<endOfText>
<human>Only later were, was one to find it possible to develop a small comedy action or a small dramatic action on the screen, this would be around nineteen hundred and three, four, five, about five or six years from the beginning, that films of this sort would make.<endOfText>
<bot>Well now I have in front of me my book that I wrote with Rachel Lowe about these erm these early film erm makers of Britain, and leafing it over I see some of the facts which lie behind the Brighton's, Brighton's contribution to this.<endOfText>
<human>Esmé Collins, I read, was a well-known Brighton portrait photographer, one of the very first to take up the production of cinema films in eighteen ninety-six.<endOfText>
<bot>So Smith, as I said earlier on, was not alone in this.<endOfText>
<human>He erm was himself erm one of a school of Brighton filmmakers.<endOfText>
<bot>And then there was John Bennett Stanford, who was a wealthy amateur, who was one of the people who pioneered the filming of the Boer War.<endOfText>
<human>And his films were shown in London at the Alhambra, and were, this was something new and exciting and erm therefore helped to establish the popularity of the newsreel.<endOfText>
<bot>Incidentally you might like to know where George Albert Smith worked in Brighton.<endOfText>
<human>He was erm in St. Anne's Well Gardens, erm that's where his address was, and eventually erm he was erm able to take over erm quite a considerable estate in Brighton, and develop it erm as a studio.<endOfText>
<bot>Now erm some of this films might be of some interest.<endOfText>
<human>Among the trick films, for example, he made use of double exposure as early as eighteen ninety-eight in a group of films, these are titles, ‘Cinderella and the Fairy Godmother’, ‘The Mesmerist’, ‘The Corsican Brothers’, things like this, and he was one of the pioneers incidentally of the close-up.<endOfText>
<bot>Usually it's D W Griffith of America who's given credit for the intelligent use of the close-up erm but Smith was immensely interested in the portraiture area of photography, and made a series of films which were called at the time ‘facials’.<endOfText>
<human>‘Facials’ meaning erm films of people pulling faces, grimaces, caricatures, human caricatures really.<endOfText>
<bot>And this was a most interesting branch of early filmmaking, it was the mobile portrait, the portrait where people's faces were in action.<endOfText>
<human>erm I see here one of his catalogue entries for eighteen ninety-eight, ‘Waves and Spray.<endOfText>
<bot>Fine effect.<endOfText>
<human>Rough sea dashing against stone groin.’<endOfText>
<bot>This was the kind of thing which fetched people in, in the very early days.<endOfText>
<human>erm Well these, I think, I think this perhaps gives sufficient of the feeling of erm the kind of work these people did.<endOfText>
<bot>But I would like to say just one word about what I felt about the character of George Albert Smith.<endOfText>
<human>I knew him over a period of about two years before he died.<endOfText>
<bot>I actually invited him when I was Director of the British Film Academy to come to London erm and with the help erm of Brian Coe of Kodak we actually reconstructed about thirty seconds of this two-colour process erm and put it on a screen for our filmmaker colleagues in London.<endOfText>
<human>And this was a tremendously moving moment, I think.<endOfText>
<bot>There he was, this very old man, talking about his process with tremendous enthusiasm, and then we said, ‘Well all right, now we'll all sit down, we'll have a look at exactly what this two-colour process looked like.<endOfText>
<human>We've only managed to reconstruct about thirty seconds of it, but this at any rate will give the impression of the way it was.’<endOfText>
<bot>Well in a sense we were able to give this very quiet manner and very enthusiastic, very explicit, very kindly, very polite erm man his chance to relive for a moment erm this great contribution that he made in the past.<endOfText>
<human>He was able to come back, and this was in the late nineteen fifties, half a century later, and tell us all about it.<endOfText>
<bot>well known as centres of academic learning and excellence, where people are taught to degree-level standard.<endOfText>
<human>They've always had links with industry and commerce, but over the last few years they've recognised the need to develop and publicise their links.<endOfText>
<bot>The University of Sussex is no exception.<endOfText>
<human>Over the past decade it's built up an international reputation for the quality of its scientific and technological research.<endOfText>
<bot>In fact it's one of the very top U.<endOfText>
<human>K.<endOfText>
<bot>research universities.<endOfText>
<human>It's high standing is shown by its being in the top three universities, along with Oxford and Cambridge, in the national table which shows the proportion of income derived from research grants.<endOfText>
<bot>For example, last year alone, the University earned a total of four point nine million pounds from research grants and contracts, a figure which has risen despite the recession.<endOfText>
<human>About a third of the four point nine million pounds came from contracts placed by industrial firms, government departments and other agencies, for work to solve specific problems.<endOfText>
<bot>Much of this work has been done for the larger national and international companies.<endOfText>
<human>However the University also runs an extensive Services for Industry programme, designed to help smaller local firms in Sussex.<endOfText>
<bot>And in the last four years about one hundred local firms have been given help.<endOfText>
<human>I've been joined today by Professor Mike Springford, Professor of Experimental Physics at the University, and Chairman of the Services for Industry Coordinating Group, and John Golds, the University's Industrial Liaison Officer.<endOfText>
<bot>They've come along to talk about the Services for Industry programme, and what the University can offer local firms.<endOfText>
<human>So Mike, what's the background to the Services for Industry programme?<endOfText>
<bot>Well you could say that erm our background goes back erm twenty-five years, in fact, we've had a considerable involvement with industry both local and national for as long as the University has been in existence, which is now nearly twenty-five years.<endOfText>
<human>Now in this respect, of course, twenty-five years is rather a short time in the life of a university, and a good deal of this time has been spent in building up a research base, and now, as you mentioned in your erm remarks a few moments ago, Andrew, we have an enviable research record in a very wide range of disciplines.<endOfText>
<bot>Now about four or five years ago, we felt that the time was right to promote our involvement with industry and commerce rather more vigorously.<endOfText>
<human>I think erm there were essentially three reasons for this.<endOfText>
<bot>The first was to give some form, and to formalise, our collaboration, and our involvement with existing industrial colleagues.<endOfText>
<human>The second was a conviction that many of us had, that we do indeed have a great deal to offer, by way of expertise and consulting, from the campus.<endOfText>
<bot>And thirdly, and certainly not erm least, we hoped ourselves to benefit at a time when the Government cutbacks were just come into force, which were requiring us to raise erm more income from non-government source.<endOfText>
<human>And what sort of facilities can the University offer?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I suppose most of those, but certainly not all, are on the Science side of the University.<endOfText>
<human>Let me just mention erm just a few.<endOfText>
<bot>We organise ourselves in different schools of studies.<endOfText>
<human>If I mention them and then perhaps give you a few examples of the sort of facilities which erm which we have available.<endOfText>
<bot>In Engineering and Applied Science, there's a very wide experience in the broad area of electronics and computers and micro-processors, computer-aided design, and such topics as biomedical engineering and instrumentation.<endOfText>
<human>In my own school, which is Mathematical and Physical Sciences, there is a considerable expertise in erm materials, in the study of surfaces using electron microscopy, in subjects like opto-electronics, in the use of radio isotopes and mathematical modelling say.<endOfText>
<bot>In Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, one finds a whole range of analytical tools, experience with erm polymers, and again the chemistry of surfaces and interfaces.<endOfText>
<human>And in Biological Sciences, erm one finds erm subjects like drug testing, plant physiology and biochemistry, and subjects like speech analysis and synthesis.<endOfText>
<bot>In addition to this, of course, on the campus there are other erm units.<endOfText>
<human>We have erm a special research unit, which we call Micro-processors, Instrumentation and Control.<endOfText>
<bot>In addition to this, of course, there's a good deal of energy research goes on in the campus, and erm there's another unit which we call the Science Policy Research Unit.<endOfText>
<human>And so, John, how have these University facilities benefited local firms?<endOfText>
<bot>Well as Mike said, since the inception of the Service for Industry programme in nineteen eighty, the University of Sussex has helped nearly a hundred local companies.<endOfText>
<human>Some jobs are problem solving, or analysis, some are much more involved.<endOfText>
<bot>You see a university has a wide spread of expertise and facilities, which is well beyond the finance of a small company, and even sometimes a larger company, especially when the expertise or facility required is out of the ordinary.<endOfText>
<human>We are, by this programme, doing our best to serve Britain's future by working with industry?<endOfText>
<bot>And can you give me some examples of the firms that the University's managed to help?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>The University does work for a variety of large companies, such as Rolls Royce, I C I, Shell, B P.<endOfText>
<human>These are international companies or, put another way, household names.<endOfText>
<bot>However, I cannot divulge the names of local companies, because in the majority of cases, the results of the work are confidential.<endOfText>
<human>What I can give are examples of the expertise and facilities provided.<endOfText>
<bot>For example, analysis, using the N M R machine.<endOfText>
<human>Gas chromatography.<endOfText>
<bot>Tailor-made short course for individual companies, to bring their staff up to date with modern computer techniques.<endOfText>
<human>Designs of locks.<endOfText>
<bot>Design of a new magnet detection system.<endOfText>
<human>Medical research.<endOfText>
<bot>Mathematical progress of schools of our education area.<endOfText>
<human>These are just some of the facilities and expertise that have been made available to industry.<endOfText>
<bot>As another example, and totally unrelated to science, a couple of years ago we undertook a project to look into the organisation of a charitable trust.<endOfText>
<human>And so you've been able to help a number of firms.<endOfText>
<bot>How have the firms found out about what the University offers?<endOfText>
<human>How's the programme been publicised?<endOfText>
<bot>Well we do this in a number of ways.<endOfText>
<human>We collect together most of the information erm in a single brochure which we call ‘Services for Industry’.<endOfText>
<bot>And indeed we've just erm put together a new edition of this erm document erm it collects together the range of advisory and consultancy services on the campus, together with a list of the sort of test equipment and facilities around, and it also notes other things, such as M S E courses and short courses which can be put on.<endOfText>
<human>And then from time to time, erm in fact a few times during the year, we circulate a newsletter to something like a thousand erm companies on our list.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, I think in addition to that we, the University participates in exhibitions.<endOfText>
<human>For example, last February at Birmingham, at an exhibition called Barclays Techmark, the University participated.<endOfText>
<bot>It is also going to Eastbourne, to an exhibition organised by the Confederation of British Industries, and to another in Brighton, on Technology Transfer.<endOfText>
<human>We all have close ties with the Southeast Region of the C B I.<endOfText>
<bot>In fact they held one of their regular meetings here last September.<endOfText>
<human>We also work very closely with the Federation of Sussex Industries, and they will be having one of their monthly meetings at the University in November, and we also hope to organise a joint open day with the F S I next June or July.<endOfText>
<bot>The University is a member of the Brighton-Hove Chamber of Commerce, and it is also on the Management Board of the local Business Enterprise Agency.<endOfText>
<human>This agency, supported by the towns of Brighton and Hove, is sponsored by the local business, with the aim of advising people willing to form their own business and thereby create jobs.<endOfText>
<bot>Also earlier this year the University formed a Managing Directors Club.<endOfText>
<human>Well that sounds quite interesting.<endOfText>
<bot>Can you tell me a little bit more about that?<endOfText>
<human>The club has about sixty members from industry and commerce, with East and West Sussex, and the boundaries of the surrounding counties.<endOfText>
<bot>It is organised by the University of Sussex.<endOfText>
<human>Aims are to provide an opportunity for industry and the University to meet, and assess each other 's needs, and for industry to find out what we are doing.<endOfText>
<bot>It is also a vehicle for industrialists to meet each other, and discuss common problems.<endOfText>
<human>The club meets three or four times a year.<endOfText>
<bot>So far the meetings have been held at the University, but the plan is to move the club's meetings around the counties of East and West Sussex.<endOfText>
<human>Membership is open to managing directors and chief executives of industry and commerce.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, so what you've told me so far's fine.<endOfText>
<human>But I'm sure there are people listening who are thinking, ‘Well, how much is all this going to cost if I want some advice?’<endOfText>
<bot>Can you give us some idea of that?<endOfText>
<human>Well obviously this very much depends on the expertise and service required.<endOfText>
<bot>If it's just advice, that service is normally provided free.<endOfText>
<human>Analysis of a single sample, using say, one of the smaller machines, will cost as little as twenty-five pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>An investigation, or a design of a new system, are obviously much more expensive, even a few thousand pounds.<endOfText>
<human>There are, however, government-sponsored schemes whereby the research councils support research in conjunction with industry through co-optive studentships or co-optive grants.<endOfText>
<bot>These are not expensive.<endOfText>
<human>For example a studentship to undertake research leading to a higher degree can cost as little as five hundred pound per year for the three years.<endOfText>
<bot>Well we've been talking about the benefits which the local firms obviously gain from the work that's going on here, but the question could be asked, what benefit do the academics in the University and also the students gain from the, the programme?<endOfText>
<human>Well first of all I think there are a number of intangible benefits which accrue from us making new contacts outside the University, and tackling and discussing new problems in different areas.<endOfText>
<bot>But certainly, on the more tangible side, it's true to say that an increasing proportion of the research in the University in widely different areas erm is supported now erm through this programme.<endOfText>
<human>I can give you a couple examples of the more tangible advantages with reference to schemes which are administered by the erm Science and Engineering Research Council.<endOfText>
<bot>erm One of them is called the Teaching Company Scheme, in which partners from universities and manufacturing companies get together to tackle problems with the objective of increasing manufacturing performance in some area.<endOfText>
<human>erm Another example is the CASE Scheme.<endOfText>
<bot>This stands for Cooperative Awards in Science and Engineering and erm under this scheme, a company erm can have a problem tackled by a research student working in a university and erm a supervisor, and indeed in this case, the input, the financial input, by the company may be quite small, may only amount to a few hundred pounds.<endOfText>
<human>One of the other advantages of this scheme is that the student erm spends some months each year in the company, and in a number of cases in the past this has led to the student erm getting a job when he leaves.<endOfText>
<bot>And finally on the undergraduate side, a number of our erm contacts have led to the undergraduates being able to erm find vacation work.<endOfText>
<human>And finally there have been some items in some of the national newspapers recently concerning university science parks.<endOfText>
<bot>I understand that Sussex University doesn't have a science park, but in fact it's got a research park.<endOfText>
<human>Can you tell me what the difference is, please, John?<endOfText>
<bot>Many science parks have been developed through the combined initiative of a university, local authority, or development agency, and a finance house.<endOfText>
<human>The buildings is built speculatively.<endOfText>
<bot>In other words, tenants are then sought.<endOfText>
<human>Our approach at Sussex is different.<endOfText>
<bot>Departments have forged close links with a number of companies in the area of research and development.<endOfText>
<human>Because of the benefits, the close collaboration, excellent facilities, some companies wish to cement even closer, more permanent links.<endOfText>
<bot>This can be achieved by siting their R and D base, or part of it, on the campus.<endOfText>
<human>Companies do not, always, on the basis of existing collaboration, wish to move directly to a purpose-built building.<endOfText>
<bot>At present four companies have part of their research and development base on campus, renting existing space.<endOfText>
<human>By using this facility they can further develop the links and use our services.<endOfText>
<bot>One company,Asansiki , a subsidiary of Toyota, is building a fourteen hundred square foot building on the campus, and an international high technology company is about to build a ten thousand square foot building.<endOfText>
<human>The agreement for this should be reached on the second of November.<endOfText>
<bot>These two companies will form the nucleus of the University of Sussex Research Park.<endOfText>
<human>From this you can see that there is a major difference between our approach and the conventional science park, in that we are not undertaking speculative development, but are using what is termed internally within the University as ‘the incremental approach’.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay then.<endOfText>
<human>Suppose I'm an industrialist listening to this programme, and I've been very interested in what you've been saying, and I feel that I've got a problem that the University could possibly give me some advice on.<endOfText>
<bot>How do I go about it?<endOfText>
<human>Well that's quite simple, Andrew, as an answer.<endOfText>
<bot>All they need do is to contact me, John Golds, either by phone or by letter.<endOfText>
<human>I will then do my best to see whether we can solve their problem.<endOfText>
<bot>My telephone number is Brighton six oh six seven double five.<endOfText>
<human>Well thank you very much to both Mike Springford and John Golds.<endOfText>
<bot>Hello.<endOfText>
<human>This is the start of a short series on science, in which we're going to explore some of the boundaries of our physical universe as we understand it.<endOfText>
<bot>Space, time, temperature and so on.<endOfText>
<human>Now that winter's coming on, what would be more appropriate than a programme about low temperatures?<endOfText>
<bot>And by low temperatures I don't just mean a few degrees below freezing, but the world close to what scientists call ‘absolute zero’.<endOfText>
<human>And to help us in these explorations we have as a guide Dr. Low Thomson.<endOfText>
<bot>Low, when we talk about low temperatures, what do we actually mean?<endOfText>
<human>I think depends upon the, the problem.<endOfText>
<bot>A room temperature might be a low temperature for certain erm physical phenomena, but by and large I think in physics low temperatures tends to mean temperatures below the erm boiling point of liquid helium, I think.<endOfText>
<human>And how cold is that?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, on the centigrade scale that's at minus two six nine approximately, but in fact we in physics tend to work always with an, what we call an absolute scale of temperature.<endOfText>
<human>Room temperature is around about three hundred kelvins, but why we call it absolute is it, erm the lowest temperature one could ever get to is in fact designated as zero.<endOfText>
<bot>So that's interesting in itself.<endOfText>
<human>What you're saying is that there is actually a limit to how cold you can get.<endOfText>
<bot>In the way that erm that the temperature scale has been defined yes, that's correct.<endOfText>
<human>There in fact originally were different ways suggested.<endOfText>
<bot>Logarithmic ways would have meant there would be, there would have been no limit in fact, one could have always gone to, to, one would essentially have minus infinity as, as the lowest.<endOfText>
<human>But erm on the absolute scale of temperature, zero kelvin is the lowest one can get, and all one can hope to do is to get ever closer to that zero, when one goes to low temperatures.<endOfText>
<bot>I think we're probably going to come back to that again in a minute.<endOfText>
<human>But let's talk for a moment about how one actually tries to get low temperatures.<endOfText>
<bot>How do you do that?<endOfText>
<human>erm As far as we're concerned, we do much the same I suppose as, as the housewife does in her kitchen.<endOfText>
<bot>She buys a refrigerator, plugs it in, and puts her food in there, and gets to some, maybe minus ten, or minus fifteen erm centigrade that way.<endOfText>
<human>We essentially buy some rather larger refrigerators which will liquify some gases for us.<endOfText>
<bot>We have two in the University, one that liquifies nitrogen from the air, and another which liquifies erm helium gas which we buy in from erm Texas in fact it comes.<endOfText>
<human>And the air when it's liquified gives us a starting base temperature of seventy-seven kelvins, whereas the helium when it's liquified gives us a base temperature of four point two kelvins.<endOfText>
<bot>Basically it's very easy, isn't it, to get down to about seventy-seven degrees above absolute zero?<endOfText>
<human>Liquid air, liquid nitrogen is, is about that temperature and, and it's <endOfText>
<bot>That's right, it's <endOfText>
<human>easier to get hold of.<endOfText>
<bot>It's fairly easy to get hold of, it doesn't cost too much to liquify.<endOfText>
<human>The, the, the, the  cost of liquifying air is around about ten p a litre.<endOfText>
<bot>So that one, fairly readily, can get down to about minus a couple of hundred degrees below room temperature <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Something of that order.<endOfText>
<human>Very easily, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>And, and, and liquid nitrogen you'll find in, in all walks of life, in hospitals all over the place that erm farmers now often have it in their farm, they, they <endOfText>
<human>That's the sort of thing you use to burn warts off fingers  and <endOfText>
<bot>That sort of thing, that's right.<endOfText>
<human>What happens when you try and get below that?<endOfText>
<bot>It gets progressively harder to get down in temperature, does it?<endOfText>
<human>You have to erm spend progressively more because it, it, it, it just is as you say much much harder to get down.<endOfText>
<bot>You have to have bigger compressors, higher pressures, and, and better insulation.<endOfText>
<human>erm Helium does liquify at a much lower temperature than any other element and in fact it was not until erm this century that erm helium was finally liquified.<endOfText>
<bot>All the other elements had been erm liquified in, in, during the Victorian period.<endOfText>
<human>How on earth would that have happened in the first instance?<endOfText>
<bot>Did people expect it to be liquified and work on it until it happened, or was it just an accidental discovery?<endOfText>
<human>No, there was a, a programme right throughout the erm second half of the nineteenth century to try to liquify all elements.<endOfText>
<bot>There was speculation in fact that helium might not liquify at all.<endOfText>
<human>People had so much difficulty with it.<endOfText>
<bot>What's interesting, Brian, by the way, is that, that helium is, it is the sort of the life and blood of low temperature physicists.<endOfText>
<human>Most peculiar element.<endOfText>
<bot>It was discovered not on earth in fact but on the sun in the first place, in about eighteen sixty-eight erm absorption lines were seen, and, and it was a long time after that before people realised there was some helium on the earth and, and, and eventually erm helium, some gas was found bubbling up through, from a pit in the Black Forest and, and analysed and found to be helium.<endOfText>
<human>I see.<endOfText>
<bot>And then, erm it was at a much later stage, in the nineteen twenties or perhaps a little bit earlier than that they actually first managed to get enough of it to liquify.<endOfText>
<human>Nineteen oh eight.<endOfText>
<bot>Nineteen oh eight.<endOfText>
<human>Is, is in some sense the starting point of low temperature physics, erm One doesn't want to mention too many names but one erm the sort of grandfather of, of the whole subject is a man called Cameling Onis who in the, erm in Holland in the Leiden erm University there, first liquified helium.<endOfText>
<bot>He was an astonishing man because not only had, no sooner had he done that, than he then performed a tremendously important experiment.<endOfText>
<human>Only three years after that he put some erm mercury into a glass capillary and measured its resistance, and in nineteen eleven he discovered superconductivity.<endOfText>
<bot>It's quite remarkable that a mere three years after liquifying helium he, he erm had got this tremendously important erm effect.<endOfText>
<human>This is one of the most important effects in low temperature physics, the fact that electrons, in many metals, go into a superconducting state in which they have no resistance whatsoever, no electrical resistance.<endOfText>
<bot>All right.<endOfText>
<human>Well let's just take a step backwards.<endOfText>
<bot>We're, we're getting rather complicated here.<endOfText>
<human>It's the electrons in metals which actually carry the electricity, is that right?<endOfText>
<bot>That's right, yes.<endOfText>
<human>And what you're saying is that if you get to sufficiently low temperatures, you get a situation in which the resistance in the metal drops to zero.<endOfText>
<bot>What's the implication of that?<endOfText>
<human>Well, the resistance of course is caused by the fact that electrons as they move around in, in, in metals, bounce off things and this erm causes their, their flow to be impeded.<endOfText>
<bot>Now erm suddenly, it sets in at one particular temperature, this resistance just disappears entirely.<endOfText>
<human>First of all it's a, it's a most astonishing theoretical phenomenon that this should happen, and in fact it took a whole half of century later before an explanation could be found as to what, what was happening.<endOfText>
<bot>Many applications that involve superconductivity, and around us today we see I think lots and lots of erm important applications.<endOfText>
<human>What comes to mind erm is that in the last erm fifteen years or so erm we've been able to make magnets using superconducting wire, and these magnets erm involve very very large magnetic fields, much larger than one could ever get using a, a copper-wound magnets which were the, way when you did things previously and erm there are an enormous number of applications.<endOfText>
<bot>The most recent, and it's quite exciting, is to use magnetic resonance imaging to look at erm nuclei in the body and to see what they're doing and where they are, and that's going to be very exciting but it involves having a very very large magnet in which one puts a whole patient all at once.<endOfText>
<human>This is a medical diagnostic tool.<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>That's right.<endOfText>
<bot>It's, it's just coming in, erm not many hospitals have this at the moment but erm Britain is really quite to the fore in, in this work.<endOfText>
<human>This work started originally in, in erm Nottingham University and in Aberdeen University and erm now we're rather lucky in that I think we have erm one company, Oxford Instruments, that supply almost all the big magnets that are used in this work all over the world.<endOfText>
<bot>Essentially you put the person in the centre of a huge magnetic coil, and that allows you to find out what's going on medically inside the person.<endOfText>
<human>That's right.<endOfText>
<bot>All the nuclei in the body process at a, or rotate at a particular speed, according to whatever size magnetic field you put them in, and then you apply a radio frequency field to the body at the, at just that frequency, and if you tune things correctly, there is absorption of energy, and you can detect that.<endOfText>
<human>And that can detect erm tumours, body defects and so forth in a, in a non-destructive way if I could put it that way.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, it will <endOfText>
<human>It's less harmful than X-rays, for example.<endOfText>
<bot>You get the same kind of picture you can get with X-rays, with what's reckoned to be no harm whatsoever.<endOfText>
<human>As well as that, essentially X-rays just tell you where things are, but erm in this erm magnetic resonance imaging, you find out not only where things are, but what they're doing.<endOfText>
<bot>You can find that certain nuclei are moving fast, others are moving slowly.<endOfText>
<human>This will inevitably lead to enormous erm help in diagnostic aids for medicine.<endOfText>
<bot>You mentioned erm tumours, in fact you get this as I said the same picture with, with X-rays as you get with magnetic resonance imaging, but what is different about tumours apparently is that the erm relaxation time with which the erm nuclei move erm varies erm according to whether a cell is, is cancerous or not.<endOfText>
<human>So that's one application of superconductivity.<endOfText>
<bot>There are other low temperature phenomena which are rather fascinating.<endOfText>
<human>There's a thing called superfluidity, isn't there?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Superconductivity essentially is just superfluidity of electrons in metals.<endOfText>
<bot>Superfluidity is something which is seen so far in two liquids.<endOfText>
<human>One is liquid helium four, which is the standard most common isotope of helium, that's the stuff that was liquified in nineteen oh eight.<endOfText>
<bot>That was discovered to be superfluid in about nineteen thirty-two.<endOfText>
<human>The way that superfluidity shows up is most extraordinary as well.<endOfText>
<bot>For instance if one has a, a bucket of erm liquid helium, the helium will climb out of the bucket before your very eyes and empty.<endOfText>
<human>It can see a lower surface and it will literally climb out <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>and down.<endOfText>
<bot>It forms a film all over the surface and essentially erm climbs up through this film and, and will empty out of the bucket.<endOfText>
<human>So what really happens as you go towards low temperature?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, things become simpler.<endOfText>
<human>Essentially if you're at a, at a high temperature, the real nature of the substance is being masked by a large amount of erm energy, excess energy, a large amount of excitations that cause randomness and cause extra things to happen.<endOfText>
<bot>If you, if you can cool down you're essentially taking away all that erm extra energy, you're making things less random, in fact one way to look at low temperature physics is, is to think that we're always striving after the ideal, we're trying to make things more and more perfect.<endOfText>
<human>The first, simplest way is simply to take a boiling liquid and to pump on it.<endOfText>
<bot>If you do that, you're pumping away the erm highest energy atoms and leaving behind the lowest energy ones, and in that sense it's becoming more perfect.<endOfText>
<human>We've talked a lot about four degrees above absolute zero.<endOfText>
<bot>What happens if you actually try and get down to absolute zero or even pass the other side?<endOfText>
<human>No, you can never pass the other side.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean absolute zero is, is just some absolute that we, we strive to get to, but you can certainly get closer and closer, and in the last erm ten or twenty years one has seen erm enormous strides in, in getting there.<endOfText>
<human>I think erm when I started doing low temperature physics about twenty-five years ago or so, the lowest temperature that had been reached was around about erm two milli-kelvins from absolute zero.<endOfText>
<bot>That's about two thousandth <endOfText>
<human>Two thousandth <endOfText>
<bot>erm degrees.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Two thousandth of a, of a degree <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>In fact erm at Lancaster University quite recently a temperature of around about nine micro-kelvins was reached from absolute zero, so that's a, an advance of almost three orders of <endOfText>
<bot>That's about erm one over a hundred thousandth of <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>a degree.<endOfText>
<human>That's right.<endOfText>
<bot>So that's getting very close indeed.<endOfText>
<human>But it's, it's like trying to climb a mountain, isn't it, in a sense, you, it's getting steeper and steeper as you get to the peak, so it gets harder and harder to get that last little bit.<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>It's by, by ever successively smaller, smaller steps we'll eventually head ever towards absolute zero without ever getting there, that's true.<endOfText>
<bot>And at Sussex, there are quite a number of people doing these sorts of experiments, what, about six or eight different people doing experiments in low temperature physics?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>We have about, I would say in all about erm twenty chriostats at, at least, and, and <endOfText>
<human>A chriostat is, is what low temperature physicists call the little bit of experimental apparatus in which they get their low temperatures.<endOfText>
<bot>That's correct.<endOfText>
<human>That's right.<endOfText>
<bot>And, and we have erm maybe twenty or so of these, some of which go not much below four degrees, but some of which in fact really go to quite low temperatures.<endOfText>
<human>We, we're one of the main centres in the country for that, and some of these erm big apparatuses go to erm well below one milli-kelvin.<endOfText>
<bot>And it's really good to know that there are so many applications in the, in the real world, medical and physical and, and otherwise.<endOfText>
<human>It's not just a little bit of science for the sake of science although it has a strong content there.<endOfText>
<bot>Low, the last question I want to ask you is really a rather naive one.<endOfText>
<human>These temperatures are incredibly cold erm and very low.<endOfText>
<bot>You can get frost-bite only about ten degrees below freezing point.<endOfText>
<human>erm Do you have to wear gloves and protective equipment to do these experiments?<endOfText>
<bot>No, no, no, not at all.<endOfText>
<human>erm The low temperatures we're talking about, Brian, are, are right inside erm very big apparatuses, so that as far as we're concerned  the room is just at a normal temperature and the low temperature is within a can within a can within a can within a can away from us.<endOfText>
<bot>It's really erm insulated by about ten different layers from erm of various kinds of insulation from, from, from the room, so that erm we never actually experience the low temperatures ourselves, I must confess.<endOfText>
<human>Probably just as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you very much, Low, and that's all that we have time for today.<endOfText>
<human>Hello.<endOfText>
<bot>This is the first in our new series of Ideas in Action from the University of Sussex.<endOfText>
<human>I'm Andrew Panting, the Information Officer for the University, and for this first programme I've been joined by Ted Nakhle and Lawrence Suss.<endOfText>
<bot>Ted is the Senior Assistant Registrar in Student Administration, and Lawrence is the Admissions Officer for the University.<endOfText>
<human>They've had a very busy summer in the Admissions Office, but now the new academic year is underway, I've invited them into the studio to ask them about this year's admissions.<endOfText>
<bot>Right then, Lawrence, what's the current state of play at the moment?<endOfText>
<human>Well, the University's just admitted all its students this year, and we've had what I think is a particularly good year.<endOfText>
<bot>First of all applications to the University rose by about thirteen per cent, which was very much better than what happened to all other universities.<endOfText>
<human>So we've done rather well there.<endOfText>
<bot>erm Secondly the result was that our intake this year has been particularly good.<endOfText>
<human>I think you may know that sometimes universities need to go into something called clearing, which is a last-minute applications process in erm in late August and September, to fill the last few vacancies.<endOfText>
<bot>And in the past few years we've had to go into clearing as most other universities would do.<endOfText>
<human>Well this year, we closed all our courses except one.<endOfText>
<bot>So we did extremely well.<endOfText>
<human>And the second point I think about this year's intake is that, in terms of A-level grades, it's particularly good.<endOfText>
<bot>We've got some extremely competent and bright students, and I'd like to think that they'll do quite well.<endOfText>
<human>So it's been very good this year.<endOfText>
<bot>Ted.<endOfText>
<human>What advice can you give to anybody thinking about applying to university in nineteen eighty-five?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I think that it must be recognised that the current state of demand and supply is going to make it very difficult for most applicants, and we would be concerned to advise them not to panic unduly as a result of that, and to make their choices on the sort of rational criteria that would apply in any year.<endOfText>
<human>One of the important lessons I think to learn is that the choice of course, which tends sometimes in situations of high demand to be too related to supposed vocational use, so we notice for example that there is increasing demand for courses which appear to have a vocational content, can sometimes lead to disadvantage.<endOfText>
<bot>If I could cite one example of that, the accountancy profession recruits seventy per cent of its intake from non-accountancy graduates, and in fact, a student taking accountancy, and getting a not particularly good degree, even a lower second class honours degree, can sometimes be regarded by employers as having demonstrated not particularly good aptitude for accountancy, and be discounted in favour of a candidate from another major subject, who's got a better class of degree.<endOfText>
<human>The lesson, I think, there is to pick a course that will create the sort of environment in which performance can be maximised, rather than to pick something which appeared to have more vocational use, but may not be as good for the individual student as a course that he or she will enjoy.<endOfText>
<bot>What about deciding which university to go to, because there are a lot of universities offering a lot of different courses?<endOfText>
<human>I think there, again, the message would be the same.<endOfText>
<bot>Think about it seriously.<endOfText>
<human>Don't pay too much attention to media pressure.<endOfText>
<bot>Think about the total environment.<endOfText>
<human>The students who perform well at university are those who are well-motivated rather than those who are able, since most students entering university are able.<endOfText>
<bot>Use the vacations to visit as many campuses as you can.<endOfText>
<human>Living in this area, for example, you can visit a campus university here at Sussex, a town-type institution at Brighton Polytechnic or Portsmouth Polytechnic, a city-based university in Southampton, and it's very easy to get to London.<endOfText>
<bot>That will give you a fair idea of the sort of environment in which institutions are placed, and the sort of environment in which you might be happy, and again, go for the environment in which you think you will be happiest.<endOfText>
<human>Could I just reinforce something that Ted said about erm vocational course as well?<endOfText>
<bot>I think candidates who are thinking of applying for entry in nineteen eighty-five, who are now say seventeen coming on eighteen, have got three or four years ahead of them at university, which is a considerable time, and if nothing else, university will make them question themselves, what their interests are, and they'll introduce them to new subjects, new areas of study, and it may be a mistake to embark on a vocational course, and discover halfway through that actually it's not what you want to do.<endOfText>
<human>I would emphasise what Ted said.<endOfText>
<bot>That is, motivation is the most important thing.<endOfText>
<human>That if you go on a course for which you're well-motivated, then you'll do well.<endOfText>
<bot>I know some people take a year off before they enter university.<endOfText>
<human>Could that be a good idea, say for, to try out a vocational area?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Provided the erm the candidate or the student knows what they're going to do in that year.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think it's any good sitting around, on the dole, doing nothing.<endOfText>
<human>So it's, it's very important to have something to do.<endOfText>
<bot>Most universities welcome it, because it gives the student a chance to look at themselves afresh during that year off, to increase their experience, maybe for a chance to stand on their own two feet and travel or work somewhere else.<endOfText>
<human>So that when they get to university, it's not the first time away from home, it's not the first time they've got their money and so on.<endOfText>
<bot>One of the, the tasks I have to do in May each year, is I write to the candidates who've just taken a year off, who've been away for the last two-thirds of a year, and I write to them and say, ‘You've been away for two-thirds of a year.<endOfText>
<human>Are you going to come in October?’<endOfText>
<bot>I get three sorts of responses.<endOfText>
<human>The first are those people who say, ‘Thanks for writing to me.<endOfText>
<bot>There's no way I'm going to come to Sussex.’<endOfText>
<human>And I'm delighted, frankly, that people write to me that early and say, ‘I'm not going to come’, because I can give their places to somebody else.<endOfText>
<bot>There's a second group of students who write to me after that letter in May, and say, ‘I no longer want to do English at university.<endOfText>
<human>I'm much more interested in psychology.’<endOfText>
<bot>Because they spent their year off teaching children in a nursery school, or working in a home for mentally handicapped people, and they discovered a new area of interest to which they can relate, and they become motivated to read that subject.<endOfText>
<human>And of course the third group of students write and say, ‘Yes, I applied last year to do Biology, I want to do it, and I'm really clear I want to do it.’<endOfText>
<bot>And they too have examined their motives.<endOfText>
<human>There are lessons in that for people thinking about applying this year, and who may not intend to take a year off.<endOfText>
<bot>And the main lesson is that there are no short cuts to choosing a university course or choosing a university.<endOfText>
<human>It has to be a serious process of thought and research, both about the candidate's own interests and motivation, and about the type of course and institution which they want to attend.<endOfText>
<bot>One of the dangers of the current climate for admission, which makes it more difficult than it has been in recent years for students to get into universities, is that the concentration is on the techniques of application, rather than on what lies behind the mechanical process.<endOfText>
<human>And I would urge all intending applicants to give very serious thought to what sort of person they are, to what their real academics interests are, and to what sort of institution they want to attend, and to recognise at the outset that that cannot be gleaned from any one compendium or any one adviser.<endOfText>
<bot>And that it's up to them to do the research, to listen to advisers, parents, other students and so on, but at the end of the day it's them that's got to go and do the course.<endOfText>
<human>All they can get from other people is advice, and not instruction.<endOfText>
<bot>You mentioned the technique of applying.<endOfText>
<human>I understand that there is quite a, a complicated form called an, an UCCA form.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm not terribly sure what UCCA stands for, but it's the form that pupils use to apply for university.<endOfText>
<human>Are there bits of technical advice that you can give to people intending to apply to university?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>UCCA is the Universities Central Council on Admissions, and applications to universities go through the UCCA.<endOfText>
<bot>It's a central system.<endOfText>
<human>It's like a clearinghouse for all, all applications to all universities in, in the United Kingdom.<endOfText>
<bot>The form is a long form.<endOfText>
<human>It can be quite off-putting.<endOfText>
<bot>Little bits of advice I would give erm are these.<endOfText>
<human>Firstly, when UCCA get the form they photoreduce it for the universities.<endOfText>
<bot>So it actually comes to us quite a bit smaller than when it's filled in by them.<endOfText>
<human>So it's important that their writing is clear, is large enough for us to read, otherwise we're going to have a really quite difficult job.<endOfText>
<bot>A second point I would make is, check spelling.<endOfText>
<human>I've got a whole list of funny errors, some a bit too near the bone to repeat on the air, but they're extremely funny, and it's certainly not a good way of getting your application noticed by misspelling.<endOfText>
<bot>So get the writing clear, the spelling clear.<endOfText>
<human>I think the third general point I'd want to make is this: if you're applying for a course at university, then it doesn't matter what A-levels you're taking, or what courses you've put down for at the five universities.<endOfText>
<bot>I think candidates somehow have got to assume that the admissions tutors or selectors don't think the candidate wants to do the course.<endOfText>
<human>That's the starting point.<endOfText>
<bot>That is you've got to prove to the admissions tutor or admissions selector that you want to do the course.<endOfText>
<human>For instance, because you take A-level English, and you apply to five English courses, I don't think you should assume that the admissions tutor thinks you want to do English.<endOfText>
<bot>And there's a section on the form which asks candidates to fill in their interests and it's in that section that a candidate puts over their own personality, and so I would ask people who are applying to think very carefully before filling that section in, and to be both broad in what they say, that is to include all their interests, but also to be very specific as well.<endOfText>
<human>I think in, in shorthand terms the best thing to do is to regard the UCCA form as a mirror, and to look at it when it's completed and say, ‘This is the picture of me.’<endOfText>
<bot>If it looks scruffy, then it implies that you are scruffy, if it looks badly thought out, unclear, then it implies that you are badly thought out and unclear.<endOfText>
<human>And to recognise that the bureaucracy of the system is inevitably large and complicated.<endOfText>
<bot>There will be, next year, something in the region of a hundred and seventy thousand applicants nationally through UCCA.<endOfText>
<human>They can all submit up to five choices, which means that there will be something like eight hundred thousand application forms floating through the system.<endOfText>
<bot>If you make a mistake, it's just not possible to go back and retrieve it, and for a selector to say, ‘Well, I don't think this person's made a very good case, I'm sure if we gave them another chance they would make a better one.’<endOfText>
<human>It doesn't happen like that.<endOfText>
<bot>The form is all you have in the initial stages, and if you don't erm fill it out sensibly then you don't get as far as the interview, when of course your individual personality can start to come through.<endOfText>
<human>All right, so you've decided which university you want to go to and which course you want to do.<endOfText>
<bot>And you've filled in your UCCA form making sure that you've put yourself across properly.<endOfText>
<human>What happens next?<endOfText>
<bot>Well what happens next is this.<endOfText>
<human>There's a reference required from a headmaster or headmistress or principal of the college.<endOfText>
<bot>And so it's passed on to the person in the school or college responsible for that.<endOfText>
<human>And of course at this time of the year I would guess the people responsible for writing references get hundreds of requests, not just for universities but for polytechnics and other colleges of, of higher education.<endOfText>
<bot>And that may take a week or two weeks in the school or college to get that done.<endOfText>
<human>And it's up to the school or college then to pass on their application form directly to the UCCA.<endOfText>
<bot>UCCA then have to process it, they create a computer record, they photocopy it, and pass those papers then on to the universities.<endOfText>
<human>And I would guess it takes something like two or three weeks, after UCCA get the papers, that we actually receive them.<endOfText>
<bot>Which is quite a long time.<endOfText>
<human>So so far we've got maybe a week or two filling in a reference, two or three weeks in UCCA, and a week in the university, which is almost I guess almost two months.<endOfText>
<bot>So it can take quite a long time to process applications to that point.<endOfText>
<human>Well I'm sure that information's going to be very useful to pupils applying to university for next year.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you very much, Ted and Lawrence.<endOfText>
<human>During some of the earlier programmes in this series, the question of how far parents could or should be involved in their children's education was raised.<endOfText>
<bot>We talked about ways in which parents could encourage their children to read, and also the extent to which Dad or Mum should help with homework.<endOfText>
<human>Today I have with me Mrs. Julia Knight and Dr. Michael Eraut, who, together with Tony Becher, have recently completed a study that looked at parental involvement in primary schools.<endOfText>
<bot>Julia, should parents be involved in schools?<endOfText>
<human>I suppose the answer to that depends on whether you're a teacher or a parent.<endOfText>
<bot>Most teachers say that they like the parents of the children they teach to be involved in their children's education, in fact I think nearly all teachers would say that.<endOfText>
<human>But of course what they mean by involvement varies from one teacher to another, erm and there are certain limits which most teachers feel that they should put on parental involvement.<endOfText>
<bot>For example, when you're thinking of young children learning to read, teachers like parents to read to their children at home and look at books with them at home.<endOfText>
<human>erm They don't like them to buy copies of the school reading scheme and keep it at home and go through it book by book, that they feel is encroaching on their professionalism.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you think, in fact, Michael, that, that parents actually can do harm to their children by insisting on being involved in their teaching at too early a stage, for example by forcing their children to read?<endOfText>
<human>Well, it's always erm possible to, to do harm, but it's also possible to do a lot of good by the interest that's shown in, in children's work.<endOfText>
<bot>erm One just needs to be sensitive to, to the issue.<endOfText>
<human>I mean if obviously the child is reacting in some way or feels that they can't even relax when they're at home, erm then someone's overstepped the mark.<endOfText>
<bot>But if it's a question of a child feeling that a parent thinks that it's important, and feeling that parents are interested in what they're doing, then that I would have thought was beneficial.<endOfText>
<human>Julia, you studied about twenty-one different schools, all in East Sussex, were they?<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>And did you find that parents were involved in most of these schools?<endOfText>
<bot>Did most of them have P T As, for example?<endOfText>
<human>All the schools involved in our study were very welcoming to parents.<endOfText>
<bot>They had actually chosen themselves to come in on the study and so they were obviously schools which were particularly interested in involving parents as much as they could, and erm they would all certainly have done as, probably as much as most schools in the country are doing as, as far as involving parents are concerned, both in having parent helpers in the classrooms, and in having organisations for parents and social events for parents of the, of the fundraising type.<endOfText>
<human>From the parents' point of view, to go back to your original question about whether it's good for children to be helped at home, of course it's, it doesn't make any sense to stop helping your child just because he's reached the age of five.<endOfText>
<bot>It's a normal thing to do, to teach your children everything from the time they're born, so to put some kind of arbitrary division on where you stop helping is nonsense to the child and it's, it's absurd to parents, too, and of course it doesn't happen.<endOfText>
<human>With the parents we interviewed erm not only did all of them see their own role as being helpers and supporters of their children as being a very important one, but a very very large number of them were doing extra teaching at home or getting even paid tutors in to help with their children.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you have any sense in talking to schools, for example, that parents were a nuisance, Michael?<endOfText>
<human>erm I think there were times and occasions where some teachers felt that some parents could, could be a nuisance.<endOfText>
<bot>erm I suppose that would mean if they felt they were taking up so much of their time that they couldn't do what they considered to be their job properly, and if they felt that I think the parents were persisting and insisting that their own children got more attention than the school could really afford to give them if they were going to be fair to everyone.<endOfText>
<human>But this was a term that I think was only applied to very few parents, on the whole, it really, it was not a sort of  ‘Parents are a nuisance’ is not a general belief of, of teachers at all, not today.<endOfText>
<bot>I know a local primary school that doesn't have a P T A at the moment, and my feeling is that in fact the head teacher in particular is terrified of the, the pressures that would be put on her if in fact the P T A was formed.<endOfText>
<human>erm Do you have any similar experience?<endOfText>
<bot>Not through our study, certainly.<endOfText>
<human>I don't think the existence or non-existence of a P T A makes that much difference to the pressure that's put on.<endOfText>
<bot>If you have a group of parents who want something particular from a school and are going to organise themselves into a group to pressurise that school, they'll do it whether there's a P T A there or not.<endOfText>
<human>But erm perhaps that's a good point to erm mention that most of the parents we interviewed didn't see themselves as erm people operating in a group.<endOfText>
<bot>They saw their relationships with the school very much in terms of an individual one, and it was their own child that was the important thing.<endOfText>
<human>That is important, isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>The, the difference between parents as a group or individuals.<endOfText>
<human>Very much so.<endOfText>
<bot>erm I think we found that a school has, it's very important for a school to get the relationship right with individual parents in talking about their children, and how their own children are progressing, and that's quite a different kind of relationship from the one between schools and a body of parents about general school policy.<endOfText>
<human>And I think both of them need to be erm thought about and looked at, but they're certainly not the same thing.<endOfText>
<bot>There's been quite a lot of discussion recently about how many parent governors or parent managers there ought to be in a, in the school system.<endOfText>
<human>And I think on the whole the movement is towards building in parents, more parents formally in this particular level.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you approve of this?<endOfText>
<human>I don't think it will make very much difference to the way things actually happen in practice.<endOfText>
<bot>I think, my own personal feeling about governing bodies is that erm they're rather ineffective because there isn't really a role for them to play.<endOfText>
<human>They may have occasions when they can be called into use for some particular issue, but on the whole there's no real mechanism for contact between governors and parents.<endOfText>
<bot>erm Governors have no true power of any sort really.<endOfText>
<human>erm There's always an ambivalence in the relationship between governors and schools in that, in order to have a good relationship with a head, you need to be on friendly terms with him so that the head, or her, so that the head will communicate with the governors.<endOfText>
<bot>If you're on too friendly terms with him, you may be in danger of not doing your job properly as a governor, because it can be quite difficult to stand back from somebody in an objective way when you know them too well or are too closely involved with them.<endOfText>
<human>And certainly the school governors who we interviewed for that, the project, on the whole felt that erm it was a slightly empty role.<endOfText>
<bot>I know that your study was largely concerned, in fact totally concerned with primary schools, but do you feel that there is a difference between the parental role in a primary school and secondary school?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>erm I think first you have to relate to so many teachers erm as a parent of a secondary school child, and this is obviously a much more complicated procedure and also I think parents, many parents feel that they know a little bit less about what their children are doing at school at the secondary stage, it's all that little bit more advanced, that little bit more different perhaps from what they had in their own education.<endOfText>
<human>So I, I think it's difficult to sustain the same kind of relationship.<endOfText>
<bot>And I'm not sure that the children necessarily want their parents quite so involved in their school life by the time they, they get to that age, they're, rather value their independence in, in many ways.<endOfText>
<human>I don't entirely agree with Michael over the business of not being quite so familiar with the work when the children are at secondary school.<endOfText>
<bot>I think erm that sometimes the fact that children have moved to a school where they have a timetable which has got subjects written down on a piece of paper, and the fact that they bring homework back with them and parents can see work in exercise books, sometimes that acts as a kind of reassurance to parents that something is going on which they recognise as education.<endOfText>
<human>The problem with many of the parents we interviewed of primary school children was that they didn't really know what their children were doing at school a lot of the time and, because they didn't know what they were doing, they sort of feared that it, they weren't doing anything or that what they were doing was not actual work, what they remembered as work.<endOfText>
<bot>erm Many primary school children have no timetable and they don't bring homework home, and when the parents ask them what they did all day at school they say ‘Nothing’, and some parents, that's all they've got to go on, and they, they get quite worried about it.<endOfText>
<human>Is part of the problem that the schools just don't communicate with the parents?<endOfText>
<bot>erm Well the schools communicate, but they tend not to tell the parents the obvious things.<endOfText>
<human>I think this is the problem.<endOfText>
<bot>In other words if you, you've been a teacher and you're working in a school, you tend to talk about the things about your school that different from other schools, not about the things about your school that are the same, and that go on in all the other schools as well.<endOfText>
<human>And yet, from a, any visitor from a, another country or another planet would notice much more the things were the same, than the things were different.<endOfText>
<bot>So parents tend not to hear about the things that really go on a lot of the time in nearly all schools and they do hear a bit about the things that are a little bit different, so they can get quite a distorted picture of, of what's going on.<endOfText>
<human>In fact there was a, I think some of the recent erm concerns about schools have come from an image that's been built up over a period of time that the schools spend very little time on the, on the three Rs for example.<endOfText>
<bot>And we found that many parents were inclined to believe these kinds of reports, and yet this just wasn't true if one saw what was going on in the schools.<endOfText>
<human>The problems were, was that the schools, since they were doing this, they assumed that all schools did this, therefore they didn't need to talk about it, they didn't need to tell them about it.<endOfText>
<bot>And the communication that does exist between schools and parents, in most schools there's, there is plenty of communication but it's hardly ever about the curriculum.<endOfText>
<human>It's almost always about the sort of fringe things that happen in schools, the not strictly educational erm organisational matters about when to bring bits of equipment and which day the term's going to finish, but very few schools put much into writing about how they teach maths, or what the children are going to be doing that term as a topic.<endOfText>
<bot>And do you think this would be an advantage, if they did so?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I do.<endOfText>
<bot>erm I think it could be quite time-consuming for the teachers, at least initially, until they'd got used to some reasonably easy form for doing it.<endOfText>
<human>But I think that erm once they'd got started on it  they would find it very beneficial in terms of erm improving their kind of over-all general image.<endOfText>
<bot>Well you've made this study and you've written a book, Policies for Educational Accountability I think it's called, which is just recently come out, and I'm sure that will be a, a very worthwhile contribution, but let me just ask you a personal questions.<endOfText>
<human>You're both parents.<endOfText>
<bot>How do you get on with your schools, the schools to which your children go?<endOfText>
<human>Really I suppose much the same way as those parents whom we interviewed who had some sort of educational knowledge or understanding of their own, since we're both involved in education.<endOfText>
<bot>It's not nearly so difficult for people who, who do know a bit about teaching, to understand what's going on.<endOfText>
<human>I'm a teacher myself and if my children come home and tell me things they've been doing in maths which might seem very perplexing to somebody who knows about modern maths, I understand the educational reason for them doing so.<endOfText>
<bot>If I didn't have that advantage, I might easily be extremely suspicious of what was going on and think that much of the sort of thing they're used to especially at primary school was not maths at all but was playing around with bits of string and round cylinders and erm certainly nothing like I remember doing.<endOfText>
<human>I think my relationship is a fairly normal one, but I do find myself bending over backwards not to erm use any of the sort of additional knowledge I have of education, and if there are things going on that perhaps I think that there might be better ways of doing it, then I bend over backwards not to give that kind of impression or to suggest it at all, because it seems to me that it's going to make the relationship with the school or with the teachers erm a rather awkward one, and I don't think it will good for my children.<endOfText>
<bot>Is there anything that you think needs to be changed, something that you've picked up as a result of your study you, you feel ought to be changed in the school system?<endOfText>
<human>Well, not in the formal sense.<endOfText>
<bot>In fact I think the people who are looking in the direction of change in terms of parent governors and P T As etcetera are, I think looking in the wrong direction.<endOfText>
<human>I mean the feeling that I got from our research was that there are certain things that are absolutely basic to a good relationship between the school and the parent.<endOfText>
<bot>First is that the parent should have a reasonably good idea of what's going on.<endOfText>
<human>I mean they like to know what's happening to their children all day.<endOfText>
<bot>And the second is that there's the, that the parents should have some kind of feel for how the child is progressing, and how the child is getting on.<endOfText>
<human>Now all schools try and communicate with parents about these things, but parents don't always perceive what the schools are doing erm in, in the way that the schools would like.<endOfText>
<bot>And I think there is scope for misunderstanding there, and I think that if those two basic things, if we could learn to do those better, and I say ‘we’ because I don't think anyone has all the answers to these problems, that, that school-parent relationships would, would improve a lot more that way, by doing these basic things better, and being sensitive to the difficulties of, of communication, rather than by trying to do all kinds of new policy things and erect new formal committees of this and that kind.<endOfText>
<human>Do you have any advice to offer parents as a whole or as individuals, Julia?<endOfText>
<bot>Only to take every opportunity to go to the school and get to know it as well as you can, I think, erm and don't be afraid to ask questions.<endOfText>
<human>I think that's quite important.<endOfText>
<bot>erm It's sometimes a little bit daunting to go to a school, particularly if you happen perhaps to have hated school yourself and not to have been near a school for a long time, got away from it as soon as you could when you were younger.<endOfText>
<human>erm It can be daunting to go back and erm meet teachers again and talk to them as, as adults rather than in the way that you used to when you were a child and erm the teacher was very much above you, but erm try your best to, to do that for the sake of the child because it is very very helpful for children if they feel that their teachers and parents are on pretty good terms.<endOfText>
<bot>Well thank you very much, Julia and Michael.<endOfText>
<human>Hello.<endOfText>
<bot>Continuing our short series on disasters, today we're going to talk about weathering and erosion in Sussex.<endOfText>
<human>What is happening to our famous chalk cliffs?<endOfText>
<bot>Are we losing them as they're attacked by the sea?<endOfText>
<human>Will any of the famous cliff paths be left in a century or two?<endOfText>
<bot>I recently put these and other questions to David Robinson, a physical geographer at the University.<endOfText>
<human>He had this to say about weathering.<endOfText>
<bot>Depends what you mean by ‘weather’, but yes, the countryside of Sussex is constantly suffering the attack of rain and the rain either has to soak into the ground where very often it erm dissolves material and eventually finds its way to rivers so that all rivers are carrying material from inland in solution out to the sea, or if erm you get very heavy rain, then the water actually runs off the surface of the ground, and as it runs off it will carry particulate material out into the rivers and then out to sea.<endOfText>
<human>An average rate is probably somewhere in the order of ten to fifteen millimetres per hundred years, which probably doesn't seem very fast when you say it in terms of a hundred years, but when you think in terms of the length of time that landscapes have been involving, then erm you've got to multiply it by centuries and indeed millions of years, and erm you can see that quite erm dramatic changes can occur.<endOfText>
<bot>Well taking our rivers, first of all, have the rivers of Sussex changed very much in recent years, and when I say recent years I mean over the last few centuries?<endOfText>
<human>We don't really know a lot about how much sediment load they've been carrying because we have been measuring the amount of material being carried by Sussex rivers for the last decade to two decades, so our level of information is very, very low.<endOfText>
<bot>What we do know is that, particularly in the lower reaches of the rivers, they have suffered in the time that man has been around in Sussex, in say the last ten thousand years, very, very dramatic changes.<endOfText>
<human>We know, for example, that for much of that period, places such as the lower Ouse Valley and the lower Arran and Ada Valleys were in fact flooded arms of the sea and that the sediment brought down by the rivers of Sussex from inland, along with deposition by the sea in the quiet waters within those estuary-type areas, has gradually in-filled them.<endOfText>
<bot>Going a little bit further east, Rye used to be a very important port, and erm that was, what, in the sixteenth century certainly and possibly even later than that.<endOfText>
<human>It now is very far inland.<endOfText>
<bot>Was that caused by the same sort of sedimentation, the same sort of depositing of silt?<endOfText>
<human>The history of it has been the subject of a lot of work just recently, in fact, from an archaeological standpoint by Professor Cunliffe.<endOfText>
<bot>But yes, erm it, it's partly sediment brought down from inland, it's also the fact that you have offshore of Rye the area of Winchelsea Beach and so-called Rye Harbour which is somewhat detached from the town of Rye, and there's been an enormous accumulation of shingle there, so that the Castle, which was built in, that's Camber Castle which was built in the reign of Henry the Eighth, since that time the shoreline at Winchelsea Beach, as a result of the accumulation of shingle, has moved in excess of one point five kilometres seaward of that point, and so obviously erm Rye is now much further inland than it was at that time.<endOfText>
<human>Thinking about our coastline, seeing that we're talking about it a bit, what about our white cliffs all along the coast?<endOfText>
<bot>Are they going to be erm falling into the sea gradually over the coming years?<endOfText>
<human>Are they eroding rapidly?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, yes, they're eroding rapidly.<endOfText>
<human>At the present day a large survey that was carried out by East Sussex County Council in the nineteen seventies, mostly looking at different maps of different ages and the position of the coast on different maps, showed that the average rate of erosion is between point three and point five metres per year.<endOfText>
<bot>erm But certain headlands and certain soft parts of the cliff were going back at more than a metre a year.<endOfText>
<human>It, it is a serious problem, I mean the area at the moment between east of Saltdean, erm Telscombe Cliffs, erm through to the east end of Peacehaven, is in the process of being protected by a seawall and an undercliff walk, rather like the area from erm Black Rock in Brighton through to Saltdean, because the rate of retreat of the cliffs there was so great erm that it would very shortly be threatening the houses on the clifftop at Peacehaven, so that erm a lot of money's having to be spent to stop the erosion of the cliffs along that stretch.<endOfText>
<bot>Is this protection effective?<endOfText>
<human>Well the protection from Black Rock at Eastwood has been quite effective.<endOfText>
<bot>The cliffs themselves are banted back in order to make them safe from rock falls and so forth, but they, they do still suffer from weathering attack by rain, by frost, and the combination of salt from spray and frost is quite damaging, so that anybody who walks along the undercliff knows that in winter, for example , you tend to get a sludge of erm white erm finely divided wet chalk which sledges off erm cliff, particularly those people in recent years who've walked behind the marina, where it no longer gets washed off by the high tide  erm where Brighton Corporation have to keep trying to remove it.<endOfText>
<human>The wall and the walk, yes, it's effective as long as it's maintained.<endOfText>
<bot>What about the walks along the top of cliffs?<endOfText>
<human>Do they, these damage erm cliffs at all?<endOfText>
<bot>Cliffs, use of cliff paths?<endOfText>
<human>No, compared to the weight of rock in the cliff, the, the extra weight of a person walking along the clifftop is, is minimal.<endOfText>
<bot>erm What does tend to happen is that in very dry weather, such as we've had this summer, the chalk dries out and cracks open up.<endOfText>
<human>Most cliff falls occur in the wet autumn and winter weather during gales, when you get a lot of pounding by waves at the foot, and the cliff itself is very very heavy because of all the water which is contained within it.<endOfText>
<bot>Moving inland a little bit, are there any significant problems which are caused by weathering or erosion?<endOfText>
<human>The major problem inland probably that affects general public is mass movement, that is to say where erm slopes en masse erm fail, that is to say sections of slope simply slip or move en bloc down erm the hillsides, and there are a, a number of occurrences where roads in particular have been cut or damaged erm in this way.<endOfText>
<bot>One, for example, oh five, six years ago, perhaps more, time passes so quickly  erm on the Lewes to Wych Cross road, closed the road at Dane Hill for a very long period of time, while the road was completely reconstructed.<endOfText>
<human>And there was another one which affected the road, again the same road but north of Wych Cross, at Bramble Tie , which is between Forest Row and East Grinstead.<endOfText>
<bot>So erm this happens quite regularly.<endOfText>
<human>And it even happens where the clays which overlie the chalk, the tertiary clays which you can see for example in the top of the cliffs at Newhaven, and if you look back at the cliff from the western breakwater for example you can see clay sitting on top of chalk.<endOfText>
<bot>Those clays in fact go right across the hillside there, and they cause a lot of problems because they slope inland, and over Ritchie Hill, coming out of Newhaven, the road there is nearly always during the winter months broken by cracks which open up, and has in fact been subject to considerable reconstruction this last summer.<endOfText>
<human>In fact there's a road at, near Wadhurst, at a place called Best Beach Hill, which slips so regularly that in fact the County Council decided it was hopeless trying to keep it open, and it was closed in oh about nineteen seventy.<endOfText>
<bot>And it's quite interesting to, to go and look at that road now and see just what it's like.<endOfText>
<human>I mean the problem is roads don't mend themselves.<endOfText>
<bot>If these things happen in fields you don't particularly notice them, because the vegetative cover is self-healing.<endOfText>
<human>It covers the breaks and tears very rapidly, and all you see is a slightly rumpled field.<endOfText>
<bot>And if you go round, particularly the steep slopes on the margins of Ashdown Forest, not on Ashdown Forest itself but when you climb up from the very flat erm plain area of the Low Weald onto the so-called High Weald, then that area in particular is very subject to, to this type of activity.<endOfText>
<human>We talked earlier about the effect of erosion and weathering on the coastline, cliffs, protection and so forth.<endOfText>
<bot>Historically there'd been attempts to cut down the effects of the sea by building breakwaters and so on.<endOfText>
<human>Have these effects been entirely beneficial or have they had side effects we don't fully appreciate?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, if one looks at the Sussex coast at the present day, most of the Sussex coast is protected in some way from the action of the sea, either by a sea wall, or by a groined beach.<endOfText>
<human>The idea of groining a beach is that along the Sussex coast the beach material is moving from west to east, this is because the prevailing winds drive the gravel erm onto the beach from the southwest, and it moves in that direction all the time.<endOfText>
<bot>The idea is that if you build groins then it gets trapped by the groin, it can no longer travel erm pass beyond it, and what you get is the gradual fill-up with beach material between groins.<endOfText>
<human>Now there's no doubt that groining on the beaches has been very successful in many cases.<endOfText>
<bot>The groining tended to begin in places such as Brighton and Hove, where  which were holiday areas, and who wanted to make sure they kept their beach, and wanted if possible to even enlarge their beach and certainly the urban area of the resort developed.<endOfText>
<human>They wanted to try to ensure that that area wasn't flooded by high tides and so forth.<endOfText>
<bot>And erm the effect though of holding beach material on one part of the beach is of course that it starves the area which is along the Sussex Channel coast to the east of beach material that it would formerly have received.<endOfText>
<human>But that stretch of beach itself still tends to lose material further to the east, because the winds are still coming from the southwest predominantly, still driving the, the beach material along.<endOfText>
<bot>And so what tends to happen is that at the end of a groined bit of beach the area immediately down-drift, that is to the east on the Sussex coast, starts to suffer from very serious erosion.<endOfText>
<human>erm The response has been for that authority then to groin its bit of beach, and so we end up with a situation today where along the Sussex coast practically the whole of the coast is groined, except for the areas which are backed by high cliffs, erm where we have the sorts of rates of erosion that I mentioned.<endOfText>
<bot>I should mention, I suppose, that in the far east of the county erm the cliffs at Fairlight, which are sands and clays are also going back at sort of the same types of rate, that they're also receding very very rapidly.<endOfText>
<human>By different processes erm but nevertheless receding at the same rate.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, where you get a big breakwater, erm the most spectacular example, historically, along the Sussex coast is the Newhaven breakwater, which, the present one was completed about eighteen ninety erm that's just a very large groin, and on the west side of Newhaven breakwater and under the smaller breakwaters along the Sussex coast, you've got the accumulation of gravel.<endOfText>
<human>erm So that at Newhaven at the present day you now have a fossil cliff, now largely buried because the tertiary sands and clays which sit on top of the chalk have slumped over, and so much of the original chalk cliff face is, is now buried, but you have this mass of slump material on what was formerly beach, and the gravel ridges stretch for what, one hundred, two hundred or more metres erm from the bottom of the cliff.<endOfText>
<bot>And for something erm about half a kilometre to the west, so that you get this big wedge which is built up of, of gravel.<endOfText>
<human>And erm in contrast the beaches at erm Seaford have suffered very serious erosion as a result of the depletion of material which they formerly received and Seaford, which of course faces southwest anyway, has always suffered serious erosion.<endOfText>
<bot>But it does seem, historically, as if erm the rates of erm erosion and damage and the incidence of flooding appears to have increased subsequent to the building of the Newhaven breakwater.<endOfText>
<human>I shall look at breakwaters and groins with renewed interest, David.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you very much.<endOfText>
<human>This is the last Ideas in Action programme before Easter.<endOfText>
<bot>In recent weeks we've been taking a look at our Sussex heritage, and asking questions about conservation and preservation in our county.<endOfText>
<human>Today we turn from wholesale to retail, as it were, and from large scale projects to relatively small scale projects.<endOfText>
<bot>Mrs. Peggy Webb has a story to tell us.<endOfText>
<human>You don't mind if I call you Peggy.<endOfText>
<bot>Not at all, no, everybody does.<endOfText>
<human>Now you have told me that sixteen years ago you retired to Sussex for a quiet life.<endOfText>
<bot>That's true.<endOfText>
<human>And before very long you found yourself involved with a project which looked as if it was actually going to take over your life.<endOfText>
<bot>Tell us about this.<endOfText>
<human>Well I had no intention of having a project but I got very steamed up about conservation generally, particularly with my time with the Sussex Trust for Nature Conservation, where I learnt so much, and erm I felt I wanted to do something actively concerned with it myself.<endOfText>
<bot>And erm one day when I was digging in a vegetable garden, I got a whiff of a smelly swamp in the fields, which once, I knew, had been an, a pond in the last century.<endOfText>
<human>And it occurred to me, I could make that a, a little nature reserve, very small, but erm rather like nature reserves that the Trust look after, and so erm I negotiated with the farmer <endOfText>
<bot>You didn't actually own that belt of land.<endOfText>
<human>No, it was a farmer's, and erm he didn't want to sell it, but I pursued him for nearly a year, and in the end he said that I could erm buy it and erm that's when the project began.<endOfText>
<bot>So you had a bit of swamp just off the bottom of your garden <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>which you decided had some prospects of being reclaimed.<endOfText>
<human>I, I thought so, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Because it was no use to the farmer, there was no water to be seen there, and I thought I could do it with my own garden tools, and so once I'd removed all the rough brambles and so on and discovered the periphery of the old pond <endOfText>
<bot>How big an area are we talking about?<endOfText>
<human>An acre, approximately.<endOfText>
<bot>An acre , yes.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>I started to dig in one corner of it, and I dug for six months, winter months, erm and erm managed a shallow pool which erm wasn't what I had envisaged at all, but erm two snipe lived there and liked it.<endOfText>
<human>And then I decided very reluctantly to have an excavator and for three and a half days it worked down there and erm created a sort of Black Hole Calcutta and put all the stuff it had taken out, it spewed around so that it, there was just mud and no water.<endOfText>
<bot>Well that must have been quite a mess.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, it was dreadful.<endOfText>
<bot>Most depressing.<endOfText>
<human>Weren't you, you were really quite horrified when you saw what the excavator <endOfText>
<bot>I was.<endOfText>
<human>had done.<endOfText>
<bot>My idea of a nature reserve and what I was actually looking at were not the same thing at all.<endOfText>
<human>Did they dig just a big hole, essentially, or did they <endOfText>
<bot>Well they left <endOfText>
<human>dig patches <endOfText>
<bot>a huge island in the middle, and erm went all the way round, and anyway I, I made a path out of flints from, taken from all the mud, and worked my way round, and then started to plant things, and a hawthorn hedge, bushes and shrubs, and erm my son gave me a boat and I was able to go across to the island.<endOfText>
<human>But how did you get water in that, that area?<endOfText>
<bot>It just came.<endOfText>
<human>Some from, a lot from the heavens, because it rained for a solid week after the excavator had left and erm from the springs, it's a natural water-gathering area.<endOfText>
<bot>And once the springs were cleared again, and all the junk removed, I've, I didn't mention that it, it took about six months to get all the junk, prams and barbed wire and tins etcetera etcetera, removed, before you could actually start anything.<endOfText>
<human>So it used to be a pond last century or <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>or earlier.<endOfText>
<bot>A, a big pond and used for watering erm the cattle and erm then it silted up and erm got neglected and people naturally just threw things into it.<endOfText>
<human>There seems to be a natural habit of people to throw things into ponds <endOfText>
<bot>Yes, I think so.<endOfText>
<human>Terrible habit.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>It, it's a thing that we have to live with, it seems.<endOfText>
<bot>There's an infinite variety of erm wildlife down there now and always mallards and moorhens, and in the pond, roach and rud and <endOfText>
<human>Did you put the roach and rud there?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, we got those put in after a holiday near Rye.<endOfText>
<bot>There was a pond by us, belonging to the people that we were with, and they let us bring some, and we popped them in, and erm on the far bank of the pond there are always lovely dragonflies, and on the other side there's some marsh orchids which, I didn't let the excavator erm scoop away that bank and each year there are marsh orchids.<endOfText>
<human>How much of the items there are natural, as it were, and how much did you import?<endOfText>
<bot>You brought the fish in, the <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>roach and the rud.<endOfText>
<human>I brought the fish in, and I, I brought various erm flowers in, such as irises and erm marsh marigolds, and a few waterlilies, and I planted a hawthorn hedge from two hundred and fifty quicks, as they call it.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, I, I think it's erm mostly nature, really.<endOfText>
<human>And the birds turned up of their own volition?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, there, there are woodpeckers down there.<endOfText>
<human>erm We had bats down there, but I haven't, but not the last two, two or three years, I don't know where they've gone.<endOfText>
<bot>When did you get the pond more or less completed, as it is now?<endOfText>
<human>erm About five years after I started it, I think everything was, was growing up, and erm I haven't done the major things recently, I'm just doing gentle management.<endOfText>
<bot>I used to do <endOfText>
<human>How much do you have to look after a pond, I mean <endOfText>
<bot>Oh <endOfText>
<human>is it something that just looks after itself or <endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>do you actually have to do <endOfText>
<bot>No <endOfText>
<human>things to it?<endOfText>
<bot>A pond won't stay still at all.<endOfText>
<human>If you leave it for a while, the reeds invade, and there's no expanse of water at all.<endOfText>
<bot>And so quite a big job has been cutting reeds back around the islands and the banks, and also we've had what they call blooms of blanketweed, not so much recently but, apparently it's more common with new ponds and I had a tremendous bloom of blanketweed the first year after I made it.<endOfText>
<human>And I filled up the boat with forty loads of blanketweed.<endOfText>
<bot>Good heavens.<endOfText>
<human>But now, if I do it in spring, it isn't such a big job.<endOfText>
<bot>It's never taken such a hold.<endOfText>
<human>Do you do it all yourself, or do you get people to help you?<endOfText>
<bot>I've had erm on two separate Sundays I've had volunteers to come and help but  and my son-in-law made a silt trap, and the Water Board erm made the sluice gate, because it goes into their stream, and it was part of their responsibility.<endOfText>
<human>But otherwise I've done it myself.<endOfText>
<bot>And I enjoy it, it's so peaceful down there.<endOfText>
<human>And you have lots of visits from schoolchildren?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, they come from the local schools and erm The Watch, the children of what they call The Watch erm part of the Sussex Trust come along, and erm oh, they just pop in and very often they, at the end of term they come with tadpoles and things that they  Oh, I, I haven't mentioned the frogs and toads, we've plenty of those.<endOfText>
<human>And the children give me gifts of frog spawn and we pop it all in.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>How marvellous.<endOfText>
<bot>And they send you lots of drawings and pictures and little poems and <endOfText>
<human>Oh, yes!<endOfText>
<bot>They <endOfText>
<human>articles?<endOfText>
<bot>When, when they've been down, and they've been back to school, they've sent me a collections of drawings and nice little notes about it, and we've come firm friends because first they look at me, on me as the pond woman, oh, they saw me on television getting my award, and erm they thought that was rather wonderful, and so we, we, we talk and now the, the first ones have quite grown up.<endOfText>
<human>But we're all friends.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, I'm glad you mentioned the award, because I know you didn't do this to do an award, but nevertheless you did get an award.<endOfText>
<human>erm Tell me about that.<endOfText>
<bot>That was totally unplanned. erm I was told by a friend that there was erm Pebble Mill were going to organise an Environment Project Competition for Great Britain, and they suggested I sent for a form, which I did, and filled it in, and erm to my astonishment a film crew came down and filmed the pond, and later on I was invited with my husband to Pebble Mill to get this award  and it was given me by Virginia Mackenna and Bill Waters, and David Bellamy was there, and erm we had a wonderful time.<endOfText>
<human>And you, you won the individual award in the Conservation Category, is that right?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, for nineteen eighty-two.<endOfText>
<human>And erm it shows erm a butterfly sitting on a cogwheel.<endOfText>
<bot>And that was to symbolise erm conservation being supported by industry.<endOfText>
<human>And Ford's put up a lot of the money and so they wanted their cut from the publicity, and they gave me another award, and their manager in Brighton came to present it.<endOfText>
<bot>But I don't know what to do with it.<endOfText>
<human>It's a plaque.<endOfText>
<bot>Put it on my tomb <endOfText>
<human>It's a plaque.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, it's just a plaque and erm but  The thing that erm I enjoyed on that occasion was meeting the other conservationists who'd been called up.<endOfText>
<human>erm Everybody was so enthusiastic about what they were doing and erm people like David Bellamy, he gets very excited on television programmes but talking to him as we were, you could see how sincere he is about everything that he does and how dedicated to the cause.<endOfText>
<bot>Peggy, thank you very much for talking to us.<endOfText>
<human>It's<endOfText>
<bot>And welcome to a new series of Ideas in Action, in which we're taking a look at various approaches to history.<endOfText>
<human>What better way of starting such a series than by talking to Asa Briggs, Lord Briggs, prominent author and historian, previous Vice-Chancellor of the University and now Provost of Worcester College, Oxford?<endOfText>
<bot>I asked him whether history had changed from the dull factual subject, all about kings, queens, and the Repeal of the Corn Laws, that I encountered when I was a schoolboy.<endOfText>
<human>I think history can be so many different things to different people, and it's partly a matter of the way in which you are taught, it's partly a matter of what you're taught.<endOfText>
<bot>There's still unfortunately a great deal of history which is pegged to dates, and dates are very important to historians, but fortunately now there's a lot of history which tries to bring the past back to life in some kind of way.<endOfText>
<human>And this kind of history is taught in school, and to a certain extent it's taught in universities also.<endOfText>
<bot>erm And of course there's a great deal of history which is now being written which is much more exciting than most of the history that used to be written in the past.<endOfText>
<human>And the appearance and the style and the treatment of, the kind of materials which come out of history publishers really represents a kind of revolution in the subject, this subject, in the course of the last twenty-five years.<endOfText>
<bot>You are essentially a social historian?<endOfText>
<human>I'm essentially a social historian, although I sometimes think that if I wanted to find the right adjective, and I've never been too much worried about adjectives, I would say I'm really a cultural historian.<endOfText>
<bot>Because I'm not just interested in society, which can be thought of in a kind of abstract fashion, but I'm very much interested in the expressions in ordinary ways of life, in the arts, in literature, in music, of the kind of society that you've got.<endOfText>
<human>And I think if I had to choose an adjective to describe myself, I would say that I'm a cultural historian, with a very strong social interest.<endOfText>
<bot>I started by being a very straight economic historian.<endOfText>
<human>I did a degree in Economics, and erm the first kind of history that interested me was really rather meticulous and careful and detailed economic history.<endOfText>
<bot>I switched increasingly to erm political history, then I moved from economic and political history to social history, to some extent linking the two, and increasingly over the last ten years, partly through the work that I've done on the history of broadcasting, and on twentieth century history, I think I would say that I would now be a cultural historian.<endOfText>
<human>We don't use the adjective much in England.<endOfText>
<bot>It's used a good deal in the United States.<endOfText>
<human>Let's have a look at some of the historians through the ages.<endOfText>
<bot>When I knew we were going to talk, I dug out some of my old history books.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>The earliest ones I think is, are books by erm Clarendon, The History of the <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Rebellion.<endOfText>
<human>Great work.<endOfText>
<bot>Eckhardt <endOfText>
<human>Yes, yes, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Dr. Howell's History of <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>These, were these really the earliest historians in our nation, as <endOfText>
<human>Well they were chronicles, in a sense, erm there were chronicles very frequently written by interested parties, and in the case of Clarendon's History, it was really an attempt to look back over some experiences which he himself had had, and in a way it is a, a, a classic of its kind.<endOfText>
<bot>There were historians even earlier than that, of course.<endOfText>
<human>There were first of all Tudor chroniclers of various kinds, many of them writing straight political propaganda.<endOfText>
<bot>There were mediaeval chroniclers, working from monasteries and sometimes from the courts, and those chroniclers were producing history which was an attempt as it were to set down what seemed to them to be the most important things that were happening at the time, with a few asides.<endOfText>
<human>And of course you really, in order to get at the origins of history, you've really got to go back to the, to the Greeks.<endOfText>
<bot>And the Greeks did really produce two quite outstanding historians by any criteria, Herodotus and Thucydides.<endOfText>
<human>And it used to be very fashionable to say that Thucydides was much the better of these two historians, he was describing erm a war in which he himself took part, he weighed the evidence very carefully, erm he produced very incisive statements about individuals and about problems, and that Herodotus had a lot of myth in what he wrote, and he was more wide-ranging, and he didn't really have the same standards of truth that Thucydides had had.<endOfText>
<bot>I read them both again erm last year for the first time for many years, and I found Herodotus much the better of the two, because Herodotus was prepared to be curious about everything.<endOfText>
<human>And I think that the revolution in history which has taken place over the course of the last twenty-five years has been a revolution which has been fuelled by people's curiosity to study things which previously had not been studied, rather than just to take some formal statement of what seemed to be important, which is what the chroniclers took, or some propaganda statement, which is what the Tudors took and what the seventeenth century historians took, or indeed to write very academic history, which is what professional historians have tended to do, over the course of the last erm forty or fifty years.<endOfText>
<bot>In the last century, there were many histories written.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Perhaps erm Gibbon's History of <endOfText>
<human>erm Gibbon's written in the eighteenth century.<endOfText>
<bot>That was a little earlier <endOfText>
<human>and Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is again a great historical work, it very wide-ranging.<endOfText>
<bot>The footnotes by themselves are worthwhile reading.<endOfText>
<human>But in a way the nineteenth century was the century of history, because it was erm thought at that particular period of time that in order to understand what was going on in contemporary life, you had to have some historical appreciation, knowledge and perspective, and erm a great deal of the explanation of other subjects in the nineteenth century was, erm if you like, historical in character.<endOfText>
<bot>The theory of evolution, in a way, is a historical theory.<endOfText>
<human>In the twentieth century, history has suffered to some extent in terms of its general significance in relation to people's interpretations of life, because we now have a whole generation of politicians who, and statesmen, if you can call them such, who know very little history at all.<endOfText>
<bot>But there's a great public interest in history in this country, so that every football club, every voluntary organisation, erm every town erm wants somebody to write its history.<endOfText>
<human>Anniversaries are landmark occasions.<endOfText>
<bot>And through this kind of general interest in history, which is not started in academic circles, but elsewhere, and through the interests of adult education works and working groups of various kinds in history, and through some of the best history taught in schools, we've really broadened our notions of, of, of what history is, and one of the most lively recent developments has been erm the idea of history workshops, where people themselves recall erm what has happened over the course of their own lifetimes, using oral history, tape recorders, and things of that kind.<endOfText>
<human>So history's a very much broader and more popular subject in this country than I think it is in almost any other country in the world.<endOfText>
<bot>We are a country which is very conscious indeed of history, or let's put it this way, of the past, and the job of the historian is to convert that interest in the past into something which is a little bit more critical, more profound, erm and which will genuinely, I think, provide you with some kind of perspective in which to understand the problems of the present.<endOfText>
<human>You feel that very strongly in the introduction to your book, your recent social history <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>book, you, you say that history is not something, I can't remember the quotation exactly but roughly it was to do with history's not something that you just write and put up on the shelf, it's <endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>something that you're very aware of and you're aware of your own destiny <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>and, and your own background and <endOfText>
<bot>Sure.<endOfText>
<human>your <endOfText>
<bot>Sure.<endOfText>
<human>own future even.<endOfText>
<bot>Well I wrote that history erm that social history of England with erm one point very much in mind.<endOfText>
<human>It seems to me that if we have any knowledge of England's past at all, we do tend to have a kind of a picture of our history in the back of our minds which may be completely wrong.<endOfText>
<bot>And there is no one single picture of English history which is absolutely right, in other words there are different interpretations of almost everything that matters in history, but what I wanted to try to do in that social history was to give some account of England's past which was meaningful to people living in the late erm twentieth century.<endOfText>
<human>Not for professional historians so much as for people who really did want to have a version of England's past which makes some sense sort of sense now.<endOfText>
<bot>And we're always revising that picture of the past, in other words, somebody else in twenty-five years' time will have to do a different kind of social history.<endOfText>
<human>My social history is very different from Trevelyan's, one of the most remarkable books on English social history, because of course I come from a very different background, I've different experience from Trevelyan, but also I've been writing at a different time.<endOfText>
<bot>And somebody else with different experience from me, writing in twenty-five years' time, will produce a very different book from mine.<endOfText>
<human>Trevelyan wrote in nineteen forty-two.<endOfText>
<bot>Trevelyan wrote during the course of the, of the, of the war, and it was of course a book which was read by enormous numbers of people erm particularly after the end of the war, and he was of course the nephew of erm Macaulay, and therefore he's in line with another of the great books on English history which were written in the middle of the nineteenth century, Macaulay's A History of England, which also had as many sales as Trevelyan's.<endOfText>
<human>And they're the kind of books which in a way encapsulated people's views of what history was, the history of this country was, at that particular point in time.<endOfText>
<bot>There's a sense in which I think you are saying something which I've often heard people say recently, and that is that in a day, in a time of rapid change, we personally and collectively need to make sense of where we're going, our futures, in terms of our past.<endOfText>
<human>And some people talk about roots, it's a common thing <endOfText>
<bot>Sure.<endOfText>
<human>Sure.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that that's something close to what you're saying.<endOfText>
<human>It's something very close to what I'm saying erm and erm I'm saying perhaps one thing in addition, which is that just as when we look into the future, which, as a historian, I'm asked to do more often, I think, these days than looking at the past, but when we look into the future, we have different versions of what that future will be.<endOfText>
<bot>There are different futures, there are alternative futures, and any deterministic view of what the future will be is clearly erm something which is wrong, in my view.<endOfText>
<human>Similarly, I think, as we look into the past, there are different versions of the past.<endOfText>
<bot>There are different scenarios, to use the term that science fiction writers and futurologists use.<endOfText>
<human>The different scenarios are there in the past just as they are in the future, and it's the historian's job in a way to explain why there are different scenarios, and to give some idea of how many of them there are.<endOfText>
<bot>And he will require, in order to do that, to be a time traveller into the past as much as a science fiction writer would have to be a time traveller into the future.<endOfText>
<human>Asa, you've got very close to saying something which I've often pressed historians on, but they've never got quite as close as you have, and that's actually saying that history is useful insofar as it might tell us something about the future.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that history is interesting insofar as it will tell us something about the future.<endOfText>
<human>erm We've got to be very careful about the word ‘useful’, because in my experience it's perfectly possible for people to know an enormous amount of history and to make terrible mistakes.<endOfText>
<bot>History in these days can be as much a consolation as it can be of an inspiration, and I also believe too that sometimes in life it's very important to emancipate yourself from the shackles of the past in order to make the kind of decisions which it's necessary to make in present conditions.<endOfText>
<human>Having said all that, I think the interest erm of history lies in exactly the same kind of area as interest in the future, in the sense that we are dealing erm as historians with time, and, to use the old cliché, time marches on, it certainly moves, and the future, the present and the past do form some kind of continuum.<endOfText>
<bot>Therefore, the historian to my mind who is really a lively and stimulating historian is going to be interested in the future as well as in the past.<endOfText>
<human>Asa Briggs will be speaking again in our concluding programme in this series, but next Sunday John Rohl will be talking about the archivist's role, and his work and discoveries concerning twentieth century Germany.<endOfText>
<bot>What do you know about the Muddletonians, the Ranters and the Diggers?<endOfText>
<human>And who were Praise God Bare Bones and Deliverance Smith?<endOfText>
<bot>I recently discovered the answer to these questions from Willie Lamont, as I talked to him about his approach to history.<endOfText>
<human>I first asked him what changes he would like to see in the history.<endOfText>
<bot>I think two of the big changes that I would like to see happening, and I think are beginning to happen, one is to put much less stress on the content of history, which in many cases is, is less important, than the learning the skills of a historian.<endOfText>
<human>And oddly enough erm the lead in many cases has come as much from the primary school as from the university in this respect.<endOfText>
<bot>The good primary school, in encouraging children to use documents, to dramatise in the classroom, to get the children into the experience of people living in another age, in many ways come close to what the university historian is doing than some of the secondary erm school histories, which are still weighed down with this content.<endOfText>
<human>So I'd like to see more emphasis on the activity of the, the pupil as historian.<endOfText>
<bot>Secondly I think the other thing is, is a change in what is regarded as the content of history.<endOfText>
<human>Because I think one of the extraordinary changes that have taken place in history at professional level is the much greater interest in things that older historian would have thought was outside their province.<endOfText>
<bot>What sort of things do you have in mind?<endOfText>
<human>Well I was thinking of things like witchcraft, which would seem a rather a luxury fringe subject, but some of the most fascinating research that's been done recently in my period of early modern history has been showing how witchcraft erm was the second most important erm crime to come before the courts apart from theft in, in my period, and in exploring why witchcraft had this appeal you're learning much more about the age.<endOfText>
<bot>The serious point I'm making is that, too often, in schools, the kind of questions are focused on just what is least interesting, not the, people's attitude to witches, or to their bodies, or their attitudes to women, to children, all these things which are now considered part of the historian's province, but instead we get saddled with the Treaty of Uncia Scolesi and the Repeal of the Corn Laws, and this is worrying.<endOfText>
<human>One of the qualities which I think you alluded to earlier was the quality of imagination, to the ability of, to actually feel what it was like to be in a particular place at <endOfText>
<bot>mhm<endOfText>
<human>a particular time.<endOfText>
<bot>mhm<endOfText>
<human>Is that, is that the case?<endOfText>
<bot>That's absolutely right.<endOfText>
<human>There was a, a very touching erm and I think rather important book erm published in about nineteen sixty-nine, called The School I'd Like, which was edited by Edward Blisham, in which he got children to describe what they thought the ideal school was like.<endOfText>
<bot>And I still remember, there was a fourteen-year-old Judith, describing her history lessons, and saying ‘Four years ago in the primary school I crouched, spellbound, before the eye of a Roman gladiator.<endOfText>
<human>Now four years later I'm doing British social and economic history, seventeen hundred to the present day, and then listing a whole lot of textile inventions and the flying shuttle and so on, all of which didn't work anyway.’<endOfText>
<bot>And she finally ends by saying, ‘All I can look forward to now is the toneless drone of the master's voice and the pendulum swing of his leg over the desk.’<endOfText>
<human>It was a terrifying thought, but it had behind it a lot of erm I think of force, and the point is that the primary school teacher who was getting the child to crouch before the Roman gladiator was not in the business of training professional historians, was much more interested in getting the child involved in an educational way, yet ironically was coming closer to perhaps what we're trying to do at university now, than the teacher who was going through a list of the textile industries and so on.<endOfText>
<bot>There's been a lot of publicity given, from time to time, to groups that try and live as people did in the Stone Age.<endOfText>
<human>And they set up little communities <endOfText>
<bot>mhm<endOfText>
<human>and they try and last a year through the winter <endOfText>
<bot>mhm<endOfText>
<human>and make things out of wood, and, and try and exist more or less independent of twentieth century society.<endOfText>
<bot>Is, is that serious history, or is it just a sort of jokey thing to do?<endOfText>
<human>Well, I, I, I think it depends on the skill and the industry that has gone into the enterprise, but in itself it could be extremely interesting.<endOfText>
<bot>I found that erm in dealing with erm a radical group in the seventeenth century, the Diggers, led by one called Jerod Winstanley, that erm I did have students who were emboldened by reading of their experiment to, to, to, to see what it was like, as the Diggers did, to form their own little commune and practise their communal living erm à la seventeenth century.<endOfText>
<human>I think it only lasted through the summer vacation, but it was a, it was an interesting experience, and in fact in, in their own little way the group showed some of the tensions which we found in our seventeenth-century radicals.<endOfText>
<bot>I think the, the imagination, training the historical imagination, is, is the most powerful contribution that the study can make.<endOfText>
<human>And I think it, it's a mistake to see it just as a kind of erm as a little frill.<endOfText>
<bot>One sees it occasionally in, in a, in school lessons where a teacher will give a straight factual lesson for thirty-five minutes, and then say, ‘Sit up, get your rulers out, imagine you're a Saxon peasant.’<endOfText>
<human>That's the kind of gimmicky, artificial sort of exercise, when in fact erm in a sense what, what is wanted is, as in fourteen-year-old Judith's case, to, to get into that situation right from the start.<endOfText>
<bot>I know that you've made a particular study of the Muddletonians.<endOfText>
<human>Who were the Muddletonians?<endOfText>
<bot>Well the Muddletonians were a weird group.<endOfText>
<human>They were formed at the same time as the Quakers, actually, in sixteen fifty-two, and the main erm belief of the group was that John Reeve and his cousin Ludowick Muddleton were the two prophets who'd been chosen by God as the last witnesses in the Book of Revelation.<endOfText>
<bot>God spoke on three February mornings to John Reeve, and told him that he was to be the prophet and his cousin was to be Reeve's mouth.<endOfText>
<human>And this little weird group existed in the seventeenth century, never numbered more than about two hundred, and dwindled in number, and was supposed to have died out in about the nineteenth century.<endOfText>
<bot>And in fact in Chambers' Encyclopaedia, they are confidently reported as being extinct.<endOfText>
<human>erm There they might have remained erm but erm a sensational discovery took place, which was during the Second World War, when, in the Blitz, a bomb actually hit the, the, the place of worship for the Muddletonians, where they were still worshipping though in very small number, and the man whom we have called the last Muddletonian, who was a farmer in Matfield in Kent, went out with his lorry — you remember petrol was rationed during the war, but he was allowed as a farmer — he took his fruit to Covent Garden, and then went to the smoking ruins of the Muddletonian worship, and filled his apple boxes with papers, and they remained there until the nineteen seventies.<endOfText>
<bot>A most extraordinary thing, because there was the records of a group running right through from sixteen fifty erm to, to the present day, and lying there in apple boxes.<endOfText>
<human>So you were able to get access to these records and make a full study of them.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, and one of the great ironies is that when I'm talking to students about the nature of history, one of the first things I try and say to them is ‘Look, don't have this idea that there's a great bundle of documents lying in an attic, and this is the way that history works, that people make a sensational discovery and then they write a book about it.<endOfText>
<human>It doesn't work like that at all,’ I say quite confidently.<endOfText>
<bot>Unfortunately the Muddletonians erm seems to contradict the point I'm wanting to make, because erm frankly it seems to belong more to the world of historical novels.<endOfText>
<human>The fact is that this last Muddletonian lived on till nineteen seventy-nine, and we believe that the, the sect ends with him there.<endOfText>
<bot>But his widow has made a present of a portrait of, of the, of the prophet, which is now in the Meeting House in Sussex University, with a plaque erm commemorating the gift.<endOfText>
<human>And in one respect it's not quite erm as straightforward as I've made it appear, and perhaps after all I'm not wrong in making the claim I did, because E P Thompson, the historian, erm was the person who really made the discovery in the first place, and it came about because he had been interested in the possible links between the Muddletonians and Blake, and this led him to ask questions which, in a roundabout way, led to the discovery of the archive.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, there was certainly an accident element in, in the, in the physical discovery of the manuscripts, but also it arose out of the historian asking questions, out of the interest that he was wanting to explore.<endOfText>
<human>This part of the country is extraordinarily rich in small sects that grew up and flourished in the last two or three centuries.<endOfText>
<bot>mhm<endOfText>
<human>Is that for any particular reason?<endOfText>
<bot>erm<endOfText>
<human>We've got quite a number in Sussex, haven't we?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes, that's true.<endOfText>
<human>Just now been produced erm a local study on Quakers in Lewes, and of course we have the, the Marian martyrs, and a wonderful blacksmith creature called Huntington, William Huntington, who in fact does actually mention the Muddletonians with great contempt.<endOfText>
<bot>It's very interesting that it's in Sussex and East Kent that, just in the border there, that some of the most exotic Puritan names that you sometimes hear about, Praise God Bare Bones and Deliverance Smith and these kind of weird names, which are often thought of as typically Puritan, in fact are very narrowly defined to a geographical area, and in time.<endOfText>
<human>That most of these exotic names, these exotic Puritan names, are to be found just in the few villages on the borders of East Sussex and Kent that, and are, are to be found in the fifteen nineties to sixteen hundreds.<endOfText>
<bot>It was a fad which didn't last, but again it does bear out your, your general point.<endOfText>
<human>And some of them, of course, emigrated to the United States because they couldn't cope with life back in the old lands, the Shakers, are they part of the same sort <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>of thing?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, that's right, and in fact I, I was interested for erm even before I got interested in the Muddletonians in the way in which people in the early modern period were fascinated by the idea of Christ returning on earth a second time, on the millennium, and erm I wrote about that experience.<endOfText>
<human>Another Sussex colleague, John Harrison, erm followed this through erm for the nineteenth century, and he's written about the Shakers and I've been interested in the Muddletonians and the Ranters.<endOfText>
<bot>In all these bizarre religious groups, one is in fact trying to recreate in an imaginative way a world that's rather different from us.<endOfText>
<human>I think that one of the great problems, and I've made a number of studies of individual Puritans in the seventeenth century, is that we talk about Puritanism and we think of Victorian Nonconformity.<endOfText>
<bot>In fact, as Christopher Hill says, they're as different as vinegar from wine.<endOfText>
<human>And one of the things we mustn't do, in fact, is to assume that erm our seventeenth ancestor is just ourselves in funny clothes.<endOfText>
<bot>What we have to do, we have to make the mental leap into a very different world in which witchcraft and dreams and superstitions and so on are mingling together and we must make that effort, and not just assume that somehow it's William Gladstone who happens to be dressed up in Oliver Cromwell's clothes.<endOfText>
<human>So history really is not just facts, it's also imagination.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>There's a lovely erm James Thurber cartoon which shows somebody sitting in a room and there's a lovely party going around and everybody else is talking very animatedly and somebody's looking over their shoulder and saying contemptuously, ‘He doesn't know anything except facts.’<endOfText>
<bot>And one has a nasty feeling that this would be erm a, an O-level history candidate, where unfortunately that is, seems to be just the quality that's required.<endOfText>
<human>And there was a Dutch historian,Reneer in London, who used to give lectures in which he made a point of not knowing any dates, and he would say ‘The Armada came in’, and then there'd be a little row of girls who'd call out ‘Fifteen eighty-eight’, and then he'd say ‘James the First came to the throne in’, and they would call out ‘Sixteen oh three.’<endOfText>
<bot>That may be a rather spectacular and extravagant way of showing his disdain for factual knowledge erm which no doubt can go too far.<endOfText>
<human>But I think it's going in the right direction, that in, in a sense what is not wanted is, is facts to, to cluster the, the, the memory but erm imaginative qualities to kindle the, the intellectual spirit's curiosity that we really want to awaken.<endOfText>
<bot>Willie, thank you very much indeed.<endOfText>
<human>Next Sunday, I shall be talking to Keith Middlemas about his studies of European Communism.<endOfText>
<bot>Hello.<endOfText>
<human>There are probably as many approaches to history as there are historians studying the subject.<endOfText>
<bot>In my investigations so far, I've come across practitioners who could equally well be categorised as anthropologists, geographers, economists, sociologists and even philosophers.<endOfText>
<human>Vivian Hart, for example, could be described as a political scientist, who has found herself delving into history.<endOfText>
<bot>Her main interest is that of minimum wage negotiations.<endOfText>
<human>That's right, it may sound a very boring topic but in fact it's turned out to be a very interesting piece of historical research which I'm still working on.<endOfText>
<bot>How far back in time does this go?<endOfText>
<human>Well, in Britain and America, which are the two countries I'm looking at, erm almost the same moment, round about nineteen oh nine in both countries.<endOfText>
<bot>And does it go back earlier in other countries, or is it just restricted to Britain and America?<endOfText>
<human>No, various European countries started erm thinking about the same idea at the same time, and there are some interesting questions here about why everybody suddenly lit upon this piece of legislation.<endOfText>
<bot>Well why did they?<endOfText>
<human>Well, the answers to that of course are very complicated, but they all became interested or anxious at a similar time about the problems of extreme poverty.<endOfText>
<bot>They discovered sweatshops and people working in their homes for long hours trying to erm patch together a very very poor living.<endOfText>
<human>And one of the reasons they all became interested at the same time was that a lot of them knew each other, and so one of the things I've been looking at is the correspondence between Americans and British people, and the fact that they travelled and kept diaries of who they met in the other country, and they all swapped ideas on how to deal with this particular level of poverty.<endOfText>
<bot>Now the year nineteen oh nine seems to me a curious year.<endOfText>
<human>I, I don't identify that with any particular happening in the United States or this country.<endOfText>
<bot>Why nineteen oh nine?<endOfText>
<human>Well, the legislation in Britain, the first law which is the law from which our present wages councils for people like hairdressers came from erm was passed in nineteen oh nine, and it was because we had a reforming Liberal Government at the time.<endOfText>
<bot>And also because a great wave of public pressure built up.<endOfText>
<human>There were big exhibits of people living in dreadful conditions in tenements in the East End for example, and the legislation in Britain followed about, in America I mean, followed about three years later.<endOfText>
<bot>erm Partly out of the same kind of wave of public sympathy, but was much slower and much more long-drawn-out process in America.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, Americans, erm I have the impression, they're being rather slow to go in for this sort of Federal legislation.<endOfText>
<bot>But presumably there were one or two great exponents around at that time that set the whole thing off?<endOfText>
<human>Oh, there were some very strong-minded individuals, whose papers I've been reading, and whose correspondence is, is fascinating.<endOfText>
<bot>The main one I think was a woman called Florence Kelly, who was a powerhouse of reforming energy.<endOfText>
<human>She erm lived in a rented room in a settlement house in New York and she really provided the, the energy of the movement all over the country.<endOfText>
<bot>If you read her diaries you discover that she travelled incessantly on trains and overnight trains so that she could speak at meetings the next morning.<endOfText>
<human>She had a number of very enthusiastic friends who did the research and, and generally assisted her, but everybody gives her credit for, not only working in New York, but it actually was not Federal legislation, they had to work state by state.<endOfText>
<bot>So they achieved it in one state and then they moved on to another and started a whole new campaign.<endOfText>
<human>Your study may be a historical one, but it in fact, this is very much a political movement, isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>It must be.<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>It was erm a movement to pass legislation.<endOfText>
<bot>It was very controversial at the time and it's remained so ever since, and indeed in both Britain and America there are political movements right now to change minimum wage laws in, in ways that I think Florence Kelly would deeply have disapproved of.<endOfText>
<human>What sort of directions are these movements going, then?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, for example, to pay young people a lower minimum wage.<endOfText>
<human>They may be doing the same job as older people, but there are questions about whether you might not make more jobs for young people if you paid them seventy-five per cent, two-thirds of, of the going minimum wage.<endOfText>
<bot>And that's the kind of singling out of one group of workers, and making a special case for them, that she really disapproved of.<endOfText>
<human>She wanted all poor people to have a floor below which their wages could never fall.<endOfText>
<bot>A subsistence level of, of wages which would be basic and never dropped.<endOfText>
<human>erm Nineteen oh nine is relatively recent in terms of history.<endOfText>
<bot>Are there any of the people who were involved in those negotiations still around?<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes, one of the, one of the surprises of this was discovering that in fact one of the people who knew Florence Kelly and indeed worked for her for a while, and who herself set up a minimum wage board in Washington, in the District of Columbia, is indeed still alive, and has very powerful memories of, of both the people and the activities of the movement.<endOfText>
<bot>And I was able to go and talk to her in Washington, and, and really feel that history was coming alive.<endOfText>
<human>She's ninety-three now, so she has a, a very long memory of, of political causes.<endOfText>
<bot>And she actually remembers the, the details of what happened in those days?<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes.<endOfText>
<bot>She talked about her entire life, and I was running behind trying to keep up with which decade she was talking about.<endOfText>
<human>She was also very much involved in the nineteen thirties in Franklin Roosevelt's social programmes.<endOfText>
<bot>But she remembers very well and erm she was able to give me a lot of personal details about the movement in nineteen nineteen.<endOfText>
<human>She wasn't actually there in nineteen twelve, she was still an undergraduate in nineteen twelve, but she became active in government about nineteen seventeen and, and her memories are very vivid.<endOfText>
<bot>How absolutely fascinating.<endOfText>
<human>And when you actually do a study such as this, where do you go for source material?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, you start out by reading any books that you can find to give you an idea of who was involved, and my next stop after that was the Library of Congress in Washington, where they have the papers of the National Consumers' League, which was Florence Kelly's organisation, and, and contains most of her own personal records, too.<endOfText>
<human>And after that it's, it's partly systematic, that you discover more organisations and you go and look for them, and it's partly luck, that erm you drop into a library or you meet someone who says ‘Oh, did you know that erm there are these papers in, in such and such a library?’<endOfText>
<bot>For example I found myself in a warehouse in Manhattan, where the New York Public Library keeps a lot of its records, and I discovered an enormous deposit of papers of, of an organisation which was actually very strongly against the minimum wage, which appeared not to have been touched for about the last — sixty years?<endOfText>
<human>My goodness.<endOfText>
<bot>Very dirty.<endOfText>
<human>I'm sure.<endOfText>
<bot>Minimum wages.<endOfText>
<human>erm Has that been a concern of unions, or has it been other sorts of organisations that have been pressing for them over the years?<endOfText>
<bot>Mostly other organisations.<endOfText>
<human>In, in Britain the unions accepted the idea and went along with the legislation.<endOfText>
<bot>In America the unions fought it.<endOfText>
<human>They didn't want the government starting to set wages.<endOfText>
<bot>They felt that if it set the wages of very poor people, the next thing it would do would be to start setting the wages of trade unionists.<endOfText>
<human>So they actually took a very active role against it, and had been the allies of people like the National Consumers' League on other issues, but on this one they really differed, and were one of the major blocks to passing the legislation.<endOfText>
<bot>And how about in Britain?<endOfText>
<human>Have the unions supported minimum wage negotiations here?<endOfText>
<bot>On the whole, on the principle that the people who are not covered by union membership very often are people it's very difficult to organise.<endOfText>
<human>They're very poor people, they may work in industries with hundreds and hundreds of small outlets, whether they're workshops in people's homes or hairdressing shops, and it's much harder to organise that kind of person than it is to organise a factory worker in a big factory.<endOfText>
<bot>And so on the whole the unions in Britain have seen this as a way of catching some people who otherwise would fall through the net entirely.<endOfText>
<human>Whereas in America the unions have seen it as an intrusion on their rights to collectively bargain, even though they haven't been very active in trying to organise them themselves.<endOfText>
<bot>In terms of this country, in particular, you said that it, it started roughly the same time because of the, the legislation in nineteen oh nine.<endOfText>
<human>That was legislation was put through by the Liberals at the time, would it be?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, Winston Churchill was the President of the Board of Trade at the time, and he actually sponsored the legislation.<endOfText>
<human>Since then it hasn't changed at all.<endOfText>
<bot>It's been recodified but the general principle of it has stayed really exactly the same.<endOfText>
<human>In America where initially it was done one state after another, it actually has changed quite a lot and erm the developments have been very interesting, partly because they've been in the courts rather than in Congress.<endOfText>
<bot>So lawyers as well as politicians have been very much involved in defining what it actually means.<endOfText>
<human>Is there actually a definition difficulty?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, there's a tremendous difficulty in deciding what a minimum wage should be.<endOfText>
<human>Should it be a subsistence wage and if so how do you calculate how much that is?<endOfText>
<bot>Is it the same in the middle of New York as it is in erm a rural area somewhere, where people presumably can live on the land more easily?<endOfText>
<human>And there's also a big problem in defining who should get it.<endOfText>
<bot>The original American legislation was only for women, and they made in fact some very erm convoluted and not very satisfactory arguments about why they should only do it for women.<endOfText>
<human>There were a lot of very poor men also in a number of these trades who were not originally covered by the legislation, and that's where the erm the developments have, have come from since then, the dynamic of the policy, because the argument over whether it should be only for women rebounded on them, and people said, ‘No, it shouldn't’, so for a while the legislation was all scrapped and then they started again, and now the Americans have much more comprehensive laws than we do.<endOfText>
<bot>Why was it originally only for women?<endOfText>
<human>Well they thought they could only get it through both legislatures and the courts for women.<endOfText>
<bot>Women at the time didn't yet have the vote, and they made arguments about women being more dependent people, less able to fight for themselves, more in need of the protection of the state, which in some cases did not actually distinguish women from men in the same industries.<endOfText>
<human>But at the time they thought that was all they could get, and they decided to go for half a loaf rather than the whole.<endOfText>
<bot>Roughly speaking, what are the arguments against having a minimum wage?<endOfText>
<human>You've explained what are the erm objections which come from unions, and I would imagine there's a political element in the sense of, roughly speaking, more conservative inclined people might be pushing against, more socialist inclined may be pushing for.<endOfText>
<bot>Am I right?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, that's true.<endOfText>
<bot>The, the erm conservative tends to believe that the free market should set people's wages and that the supply and demand of labour and the number of people looking for jobs in an industry will affect the level that the wages reach.<endOfText>
<human>And the argument that my reformers made against that was simply that where you have a huge number of people who are desperate for jobs, there's no level below which the wages may not fall, under a free market system.<endOfText>
<bot>But there's a moral argument that at some point you're not paying them enough to live on.<endOfText>
<human>You're paying them starvation wages, and someone else therefore is keeping them alive, might be their husbands, it might be the state giving them charity, it might be the state giving them pensions or unemployment benefits, it might be charities giving them clothes and food just to keep them alive, and that that's immoral.<endOfText>
<bot>No employer has a right to take the work of a man or a woman without paying them a living wage.<endOfText>
<human>So the moral argument was the one originally that triumphed, but the argument about the market is, is the alternative.<endOfText>
<bot>You basically are in favour of a minimum wage.<endOfText>
<human>I'm convinced by the moral argument.<endOfText>
<bot>It's very hard to spend months in the archives, reading the papers of the people who spent so much of their lives fighting for this kind of thing, and not I think be rather affected by dedication and by the evidence that they amassed with such enormous difficulty, and by the way they kept coming back and fighting for it over and over again, and the free market argument by comparison lacks that kind of humanity I think.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you very much, Vivian.<endOfText>
<bot>Hello.<endOfText>
<human>About a month ago I spent an afternoon looking through the German National Film Archives in Coblentz.<endOfText>
<bot>Three of us, an American student, a German woman and I, watched newsreels dating from before the First World War to about nineteen forty-eight.<endOfText>
<human>After a couple of hours the German lady and I were so choked with emotion that we were scarcely able to speak.<endOfText>
<bot>‘That was a lot of fun,’ said our young American companion, as we left.<endOfText>
<human>John Rohl is a historian with a special expertise in modern German history.<endOfText>
<bot>John, how did you actually get interested in German history?<endOfText>
<human>I think the first answer I must give you is, is simply in terms of my personal biography.<endOfText>
<bot>I was born in London in nineteen thirty-eight, but my father was German, my mother was English, I was actually born in the German Hospital in London.<endOfText>
<human>And so I was almost predestined to consider how the two great nations of Western Europe, the Germans and the English, related to one another.<endOfText>
<bot>And of course I was also born almost with the, with one very important advantage, which was that I could speak German erm from birth, as well as English.<endOfText>
<human>So you've carried out quite a lot of your studies actually in Germany.<endOfText>
<bot>I am very much an archive man, Brian.<endOfText>
<human>I spend all my vacations, and sometimes my sabbatical years, in German archives, rooting out erm previously unpublished material.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you have a particular speciality, a particular interest?<endOfText>
<human>In a narrow sense my main interest is the period in which the Kaiser ruled over Germany, which of course includes the First World War.<endOfText>
<bot>In a more general sense I am fascinated by some of the things you've just mentioned in your introduction, the question of continuity in German history, how we, how this marvellous nation, the nation of Beethoven and Wagner and Marx and Freud, actually finishes up going to war twice against its European neighbours, and in the Second World War in particular committing these awful atrocities.<endOfText>
<human>And in the process of course destroying the old Europe, allowing the very thing that, arguably, they were trying to stop from happening, to happen, that is to say, allowing the Russians to advance towards the Elbe, and allowing the Anglo-Saxons as they see it to erm come from the west and taken over the western half of Europe.<endOfText>
<bot>Germany as a country hasn't really existed for very long, has it?<endOfText>
<human>It was founded, as you rightly imply, in the eighteen sixty-six to seventy-one period as a nation-state, although one could argue whether in fact it was a nation-state or not.<endOfText>
<bot>And of course it was completely cut apart in nineteen forty-five, losing two-fifths of its territories altogether to Poland, and erm the remainder then being erm cut into two, to East Germany and West Germany, with France receiving Alsace-Lorraine back again.<endOfText>
<human>What went wrong with Germany as a nation?<endOfText>
<bot>That's a question we're all asking ourselves.<endOfText>
<human>There are basically two interpretations, if you like, in a broad sense.<endOfText>
<bot>The first is that everything was really all right until nineteen eighteen.<endOfText>
<human>In other words, according to this view, Germany along with all the other nations stumbled into war in nineteen fourteen, was then declared, simply because she was the defeated party, declared to be the guilty party, erm had punitive terms imposed on her at the Treaty of Versailles, and as a result of this moved towards extremism in internal politics, with the erm consequence that the Democratic Republic of Weimar collapsed, erm Hitler came to power, and Hitler was some kind of evil person, a Satanic messenger from Hell, who first of all visited his atrocities on, on the Germans before doing the same to Europe as a whole.<endOfText>
<bot>That is the old view that a lot of the older generation of conservative German historians have been trying to persuade us of.<endOfText>
<human>The alternative vision is the one that I subscribe to, and along with me, most historians in this country and in America, and indeed increasingly erm a young generation of German historians, and this is that things began to go wrong well before nineteen fourteen, and that the Germans in fact deliberately started the First World War as the Treaty of Versailles said they did, that nineteen eighteen was not therefore the beginning of the evil, but merely a hiccup in erm a German attempt to conquer Europe, erm as it were, a play with two acts, the first act being nineteen fourteen to eighteen, and then the second act being nineteen thirty-nine to forty-five, two attempts to dominate the continent of Europe by military force.<endOfText>
<bot>It's an interesting situation that you alluded to, that people that win wars, on the whole, given enough time, are regarded as ‘all right’, whereas people that lose often are cast in the role of being baddies.<endOfText>
<human>I suppose if we look at British history there was a period in the last century and earlier where we did a pretty good job of conquering people, but we don't feel too badly about that, but we feel pretty indignant about Germany trying to take a bit more territory at various points.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, I think one of the mistakes the Germans made erm was to try to take territory in Europe.<endOfText>
<human>The times had simply passed when one could conquer France, conquer Belgium, conquer Holland, even conquer Eastern Europe, and say, ‘This is the same as moving into Africa or moving into the Far East’.<endOfText>
<bot>The nations of Europe had become too proud, too self-aware to tolerate that, and gradually, with this kind of behaviour, a collective anti-German consciousness arose I think which, strangely, even today unites Russians, Poles, with people in the west of Europe and America.<endOfText>
<human>Do you believe in what I might call national characteristics?<endOfText>
<bot>Do you think, for example, in Germany, in the nineteen-thirties, there was just an evil genius, Hitler, who managed to carry all before him, or do you think that the, the people as a whole were ready to be persuaded along those particular lines?<endOfText>
<human>I don't believe in national character in any biological sense, but I do think that the German people were ready for a person like Hitler.<endOfText>
<bot>Now in between those two extremes, the notion on the one hand that somehow national character is biologically predetermined, and the other that what nations do is merely accidental, erm you've got the whole area of erm education, state control of the media, newspapers, erm even prisons and armies, conscription, things of that kind, which actually fashion erm national character for, not forever, but for the period in which those forces are in control, and that is a particular message that the youth of that country is receiving.<endOfText>
<human>In other words this can be susceptible to change.<endOfText>
<bot>If you then get a complete change in regime, as happened in nineteen forty-five, if you get re-education, if you get a completely new economic and indeed world, international situation, then of course the Germans become different people.<endOfText>
<human>How is the German background, the German education, the German social system, whatever it is, how does it differ, say, from the English system?<endOfText>
<bot>Well since nineteen forty-five, in the Federal Republic of Germany, there is very little difference essentially between the educational system erm there and the educational system in this country, for very obvious reasons, I think the western Allies simply imposed their values, their educational systems among other things, on the West Germans, who were rather reluctant at the time to accept it, but have grown to love those values and arguably are now as good if not better at preserving them than we are.<endOfText>
<human>Of course before nineteen forty-five the value system being emitted by the educational system and other sources in the whole of Germany, in a much larger Germany than the Federal Republic of Germany, was very different indeed from those being purveyed in the educational establishments of this country or in France.<endOfText>
<bot>In what ways, John, did they differ?<endOfText>
<human>erm I think there was a great erm stress on authoritarianism.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean all the clichés really on Germany's need to expand militarily, on the need to do one's duty, to obey orders in an unquestioned way.<endOfText>
<human>You had to be very courageous to be a democrat.<endOfText>
<bot>It wasn't the dominant ideology.<endOfText>
<human>If one is of course a member of a minority, let us say, one is a Jew or erm a socialist or erm a South German, erm then one is much more likely to cherish democratic values and federal values, and much less likely to accept authoritarian rule from above.<endOfText>
<bot>John, you're clearly very passionately involved with this, and have been involved with studying German history for twenty years plus.<endOfText>
<human>erm Why is this?<endOfText>
<bot>One of the reasons, Brian, is that I think German history is too important to be left to the German historians.<endOfText>
<human>They've not in the past shown themselves to be very honest erm nor very keen on going into their own archives, and I think it's, actually takes people like me, who live on the border-lines if you like of the two cultures, to go in and discover erm sometimes embarrassing documents, embarrassing information, to confront them with it, in their own language, so that they have to take stock.<endOfText>
<bot>If it weren't for people like myself erm then maybe the older German tradition of historical writing would still today be dominant.<endOfText>
<human>One of the things that always puzzles me about archives is it seems to me that there must be a limited number of archives, and there are an awful number of historians.<endOfText>
<bot>How do people keep on finding new things to look at?<endOfText>
<human>erm I think the first answer is that erm not all historians go into archives.<endOfText>
<bot>I think they ought to much more than they do, but the plain truth is that they don't.<endOfText>
<human>A lot of them philosophise, and let's be clear about this, it's actually extraordinarily difficult to read erm German archival records.<endOfText>
<bot>I've known many British historians who have an adequate reading knowledge of German, erm who go into the archives expecting to be able to read the documents, and what they don't realise in advance is that the handwriting is actually Gothic script.<endOfText>
<human>It is a handwriting that you could not read, for example, however hard you tried.<endOfText>
<bot>It is as foreign to, to your eyes as the Russian script would be.<endOfText>
<human>So one has to actually learn erm an entirely new alphabet before even being able to read the first word on the first page that you see in the archives.<endOfText>
<bot>And a lot of people at that stage give up.<endOfText>
<human>There are a lot of archives, but there are even more archives than you imagine there are because there are actually erm a huge number of archives in private houses and castles in Germany that are not public archives, and a lot of people don't even know about these.<endOfText>
<bot>I think you have to evolve, develop quite a lot of detective sense, to meet people, to imagine where could further letters be that would help me, and you have to charm your way virtually into those houses, and persuade the people erm to let you look at Grandfather's letters in the trunk in the attic.<endOfText>
<human>And do you very often come up with erm new papers, new information, which, in your mind, at any rate, changes one's view <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>about what happened?<endOfText>
<bot>All the time.<endOfText>
<human>Every time I go into a new archive I just can't believe what I'm discovering.<endOfText>
<bot>Just give you one example if I may erm which erm will serve to underline the sort of points that I've been making erm to you.<endOfText>
<human>I discovered recently, in a public archive, a letter from the Kaiser, written in nineteen nineteen, to erm an ex-general of his, saying that the Jews must be exterminated from German soil.<endOfText>
<bot>More recently still, I came across a letter written in English, by the Kaiser to an American friend, dated nineteen twenty-five, in which he writes, erm ‘The Jews must be exterminated in a pogrom covering the whole world.’<endOfText>
<human>That is clear in his mind, the only question for him is how this should be done, and he says, ‘I think probably we should treat them like mosquitoes, that is to say, we should, we must use gas.’<endOfText>
<bot>And it was popularly believed that those ideas weren't prevalent until much later presumably.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, I mean this material, which I've discovered, when it's published, will rock the German historical establishment, there's no doubt about it.<endOfText>
<bot>Their entire case has been designed to prove that Hitler was some kind of freak event that had no links with the German past.<endOfText>
<human>If I can demonstrate that the Kaiser himself, the monarch who ruled Germany for thirty years until nineteen eighteen, had ideas very similar if not identical to those of Hitler's, at a time when he was not in contact with Hitler, when Hitler's party was nowhere in political terms, then I think that's yet another very important indication that there is continuity in German history from say the Bismarckian period through to nineteen forty-five, and that Hitler stands in that national tradition, and is not some kind of lightning erm that, that struck Germany erm from a blue sky.<endOfText>
<bot>John, my last question is simply this: Can one learn from history?<endOfText>
<human>Do you think that the German people today have a sense of their own recent history?<endOfText>
<bot>Somebody once said that if we don't history we're condemned to repeat history, and God forbid if that were erm to happen.<endOfText>
<human>I don't think it will happen, because I think the German people have learned from their history.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm bound to say that they failed to learn from their own history after nineteen-eighteen, so that they did in effect repeat erm their history a second time with disastrous consequences for everybody.<endOfText>
<human>Had they, after nineteen-eighteen, learnt the lessons that were to be learnt, then we might have been spared Hitler and the Second World War.<endOfText>
<bot>You said at an earlier stage in this conversation erm that it's always the defeated parties who are blamed for starting wars.<endOfText>
<human>That implies that in a sense that there's a question of choice about it.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think there is a question of choice.<endOfText>
<human>I think the record, it's available in the archives, historians who are honest and hardworking could even then have come up with erm answers that would have incriminated the German leaders of nineteen-fourteen, and therefore moved German society, I believe, substantially towards the democratic centre, if not the Social Democratic Left.<endOfText>
<bot>Fascinating, John.<endOfText>
<human>I wish we had time to talk more about this.<endOfText>
<bot>Next Sunday, Willie Lamont gives his approach to history, when<endOfText>
<human>Of a number of works on twentieth century literature, including books on Camus and other people.<endOfText>
<bot>And, perhaps most important from the point of view of Sussex, he was the originator and the editor of a series which will be many of you, largely based on productions from this University, erm involving, comprising six volumes on French literature and its background.<endOfText>
<human>He was fairly recently awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters by his college, Trinity College Dublin, he tells me he's not quite sure why but I think there are really good reasons, and he is a member of the University's Grants Committee.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm not at all sure about the relevance of the last of these qualifications to the proceedings this evening  but I am sure that all the other qualifications and all the rest of the experience conspire to make John Cruikshank an eminently suitable lecturer on our subject for tonight, which is ‘Proust: Novelist and Explorer’.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you, John.<endOfText>
<bot>Ladies and gentlemen, I'm very grateful to Professor Eppell for his characteristically kind and generous remarks, and erm I accept them all the more readily because I know you will treat them with a healthy degree of scepticism.<endOfText>
<human>erm At least two considerations, I think, make it a rather unnerving experience to attempt a critical assessment of Proust.<endOfText>
<bot>In the first place, because of his own sharp intelligence and his, particularly perhaps his self-awareness, as a writer, he's one of the best exponents of his own work, and one has moments of panic therefore, erm in which further comment seems either foolhardy or superfluous or quite likely both.<endOfText>
<human>erm Again, Proust emphasised repeatedly the shifting, elusive nature of personal identity.<endOfText>
<bot>erm In fact a simple formulation of this problem occurs in the opening paragraphs of À la Recherche, erm when the narrator writes this: ‘When I woke in the middle of the night, I could not tell where I was, just as I did not know at first who I was.<endOfText>
<human>I simply experienced, in its most elementary form, the sense of existing.’<endOfText>
<bot>This distinction, between, as it were, having an existence, and possessing an identity, erm is a major preoccupation in the novel, just as finding answers to the questions ‘Where am I?’ or rather more importantly ‘Who am I?’is one of its central objectives.<endOfText>
<human>The fact that individual identity is surrounded by doubt and confusion in this way prompts of course the anxious question in such as myself, ‘Who was Marcel Proust?’ and ‘Has one identified him in terms appropriate to a centenary celebration?’<endOfText>
<bot>In seeking to answer this last question, erm I decided not to attempt a kind of structural analysis, the kind of structural analysis which characterises in fact a lot of important current critical writing, but to approach Proust in fact along the more familiar lines of biography and straight analysis of his work.<endOfText>
<human>I did so erm partly because this seems the most useful approach for an audience, not all of whom perhaps have read in detail the fifteen volumes of À la Recherche du Temps Perdu, erm and partly because he in fact offers a very interesting challenge, I think, at this precise level.<endOfText>
<bot>Once one thinks in terms of the man on the one hand, and his writings on the other, one is surprise, even, I think, puzzled and disconcerted, by the disparity, the apparent disparity at any rate, between, on the one hand, the frequenter of the Faubourg Saint Germain salons, and, on the other, the author of À la Recherche, between the rather eccentric hypochondriac and the observer in the novel of human weakness, erm between perhaps the often precious and whimsical Figaro columnist and the architect of an astonishingly complex and lengthy novel, amounting to something like one and a quarter million words.<endOfText>
<human>If one is inclined, as one may well be, to doubt the validity of sets of distinctions of the kind I've just made, they are at least based on a separation which Proust placed at the centre of his own critical theory.<endOfText>
<bot>In a damaging exposure of Saint Beuve's literary critical method, Proust argued against Saint Beuve that the biography of a writer, erm even an account of his habits, his social attitudes, his vices, his virtues and so on, that this may tell us nothing at all about the nature and significance of his imaginative work.<endOfText>
<human>erm The social man, Proust says, rarely offers a key to the creative personality, and he's anxious to keep a distinction between these two things, and I shall try to do something the same.<endOfText>
<bot>erm This idea, I think, takes particular form in À la Recherche.<endOfText>
<human>Marcel, the first person narrator of the novel, meets the writer Bergotte for the first time.<endOfText>
<bot>Up to this point, he'd experienced an almost boundless admiration for the Bergotte whose books he had read with intense pleasure, if you like, Bergotte the artist and thinker.<endOfText>
<human>And now, on a particular social occasion in the novel, he's introduced to Bergotte at a gathering in the Faubourg Saint Germain erm and he's shocked at what seems to be the gap between the man who faces him and the author whose works he has so admired, and he writes, ‘My greeting was returned by a youthful, uncouth, small, thickset, shortsighted person, with a red nose, curled like a snail's shell, and a black tuft on his chin.<endOfText>
<bot>The nose and beard also seemed to imply, to produce, to secrete constantly a certain kind of mind which had nothing to do with the intelligence diffused throughout the books, books that I knew so intimately, and which were permeated by a gentle and God-like wisdom.’<endOfText>
<human>One may say, of course, that Marcel is shocked simply because he has a foolish, a foolishly romantic conception of what a writer should look like.<endOfText>
<bot>One may also want to argue that an uncouth manner and a snail-like nose erm are no barrier to the possession of gentle and God-like wisdom.<endOfText>
<human>erm Yet the distinction is one on which Proust repeatedly insists, at least for critical purposes, and elsewhere I think he puts the same idea quite succinctly, when he says and I quote, ‘The man who inhabits the same body as a great genius has very little contact with him.’<endOfText>
<bot>The dualism implied by this statement can be related I think directly and appropriately to Proust himself.<endOfText>
<human>At the same time it seems fair to say that until recently, writing about Proust, particularly perhaps in England, but in France, too, has concentrated too much and too exclusively on the social element in the dualism, has concentrated too much, if you like, on the nose and the beard.<endOfText>
<bot>Reminiscences have been published, dwelling lovingly on the Belle Époque, and Proust's place in it.<endOfText>
<human>Octogenarian titled ladies have provided accounts of Proust dining at the Ritz and dispensing ridiculously large tips, playing the tables in various fashionable casinos, entertaining the Faubourg Saint Germain with his gossip and his apparently outstanding powers of mimicry, or even cautiously testing the air, at one of the Normandy seaside resorts, wrapped in his fur-lined cloak on a summer day.<endOfText>
<bot>Now of course all this is fascinating in its own way, and it no doubt leads us at least onto the fringes of an entertaining piece of social history.<endOfText>
<human>Nevertheless, I think its effect is to distort in some ways the dualism set up by Proust.<endOfText>
<bot>erm The effect is in fact to concentrate on the curling nose and the tufted beard at the expense of the wisdom and the artistic achievement.<endOfText>
<human>It seems to me appropriate and indeed perhaps essential that one should offer a brief biographical sketch of Proust on an occasion like this, but I shall try to avoid the unbalance of which I've spoken, by at least relating the biography to the circumstances in which the novel was written, and I shall in any case spend the major part of the time that remains on an examination of the novel itself.<endOfText>
<bot>Marcel Proust was born in Paris, on the tenth of July, eighteen seventy-one, two months after the collapse of the Commune. erm His father was a well-known doctor, who seems curiously enough to have failed markedly to understand the causes of his son's lifelong illness erm and his mother was the daughter of a Jewish stockbroker.<endOfText>
<human>And although Proust and his younger brother were in fact brought up as Catholics, Marcel remained particularly conscious of the Jewish elements in his background, and this indeed is quite an important element, as some of you will know, in the novel.<endOfText>
<bot>When the Dreyfus Affair, with its rather unpleasant anti-Semetic, anti-Semitic aspects, broke on the French political scene in the eighteen nineties, Proust became an active Dreyfuseur at once, signing the famous Manifesto of the Intellectuals, and obtaining the signatures of various other people.<endOfText>
<human>He attended the trial of Zola daily, and he even smuggled a copy of his first book of essays, as it turns out I think the wildly inappropriate Les plaisirs et les jours, to the imprisoned Colonel Picard, who had become the defender of Dreyfus at considerable personal cost.<endOfText>
<bot>From the age of nine Proust suffered spasmodically but severely from asthma.<endOfText>
<human>Inevitably his mother nursed and protected him in his early years, and this was the basis of a deep, perhaps inordinately and unhealthily deep, attachment of son to mother.<endOfText>
<bot>On the other hand, as his awareness of his own homosexual tendencies developed during his teens, the deep emotional dependence on his mother was complicated by a contrary feeling of resentment, based no doubt on guilt.<endOfText>
<human>Because of course he knew perfectly well that the promptings of his own nature were an offence to his mother's moral code.<endOfText>
<bot>And I think one can say that, by general standards, Proust was physically ill, and emotionally unbalanced, despite his increasing social successes, and even an unexpected twelve months spent, as a volunteer mark you, in the French army.<endOfText>
<human>erm He became in fact the arch-introspective: ill, somewhat neurotic, and yet possessing unusual insight into his own and other people's emotional and mental processes.<endOfText>
<bot>Despite the distinction he made between, as it were, the ordinary daily self and the special writing self, it's difficult not to see, in his own nature, evidence of some of his clearest gifts as a novelist.<endOfText>
<human>Indeed, he accepts, I think, this kind of connection, when he writes, at one point, well on in the novel, ‘The magnificent yet pitiable family of the nervously afflicted is the salt of the earth.<endOfText>
<bot>It is they and they only who have founded religions and composed artistic masterpieces.’<endOfText>
<human>The religion which Proust eventually elaborated, as we shall see, was I think a religion of art, and the masterpiece which he wrote was of course his novel in fifteen volumes.<endOfText>
<bot>Up to the age of thirty or so he appeared to devote himself mainly to the social life of various celebrated Parisian salons.<endOfText>
<human>Although he has been accused, of course, of social snobbery, I think it's clear that he observed the life around him closely and critically.<endOfText>
<bot>Indeed, a striking and major aspect of the final volumes of À la Recherche is their often cruel analysis of the moral bankruptcy and social collapse of this salon world, during the years that culminated in the First World War.<endOfText>
<human>It seems fair to say, in fact, that the first thirty years of Proust's life laid much of the intellectual basis for his later literary erm achievements, and it was incidentally also during the eighteen nineties, that, among other things, he obtained a, a Licence des lettres, that he attended Bergson's lectures, that he discovered Ruskin, and that he wrote the bulk of nearly a thousand manuscript sheets discovered in an old hatbox after the last World War, and published as Jean Santeuil in nineteen fifty-two.<endOfText>
<bot>And this is a novel which is I suppose an early but certainly a very embryonic attempt to write À la Recherche.<endOfText>
<human>Between nineteen hundred and one and nineteen hundred and six, increasing illness erm severely restricted Proust's social engagements, and indeed because of his asthma erm he tended to stay in bed during the day, and get up only at night, though even those who don't suffer from asthma have been known to adopt this regime for other purposes.<endOfText>
<bot>erm His father died in nineteen hundred and three and his mother in nineteen hundred and five and of course his mother's death was a particularly shattering blow, and he actually spent six weeks in a clinic for neurotics.<endOfText>
<human>However, again like many another, Proust cherished, and I mean cherished, his own psychosomatic troubles.<endOfText>
<bot>He successfully resisted treatment, and he returned home from the clinic describing himself, and I use his own words, as being ‘fantastically ill’.<endOfText>
<human>At the same time, erm if his mother's death intensified his illness, it also freed him to concentrate more fully on the writing of his novel.<endOfText>
<bot>Madame Proust had not greatly favoured his desire to write fiction.<endOfText>
<human>She had encouraged him rather to work as a translator, this seemed to be a safer activity.<endOfText>
<bot>erm Also while she still lived, he had been of course inhibited from putting down on paper very much of a novel which, now largely formed in his mind, and in which sexual abnormality would play erm at least a considerable part.<endOfText>
<human>At the end of nineteen hundred and six, he moved to the Boulevard Haussmann.<endOfText>
<bot>Because of a phobia about noise, which was one of his several rather neurotic characteristics, he had his study, as we all know, lined with cork to insulate it.<endOfText>
<human>And indeed, incidentally, when he stayed in the famous erm Grande Hôtel at Cabours in the summer, he frequently rented additional rooms on either side of his own, in order to ensure silence.<endOfText>
<bot>This is also the period when he hired as chauffeur and typist a young man, Alfred Agostinelli, who drove him to the seaside in a closed car, took him by the same means to visit many Romanesque churches in Normandy, and who was killed when the plane he was learning to fly crashed into the sea off Antibes in nineteen fourteen.<endOfText>
<human>And Proust's relationship with Agostinelli, over a period of I suppose something like seven years, undoubtedly contributed a certain amount to the main outline of the Marcel-Albertine affair in the novel.<endOfText>
<bot>The last fifteen years of Proust's life — he died in nineteen twenty-two — are mainly the story of the actual writing of À la Recherche.<endOfText>
<human>It was completed in nineteen hundred and twelve, turned down by three publishing houses, including the Nouvelle Revue Française, and finally accepted by Grasset on the understanding that, while it would appear under Grasset's imprint, it would also appear at the author's expense.<endOfText>
<bot>erm Only Du Côté de chez Swann erm had appeared when the outbreak of war, and Bernard Grasset's call-up, interrupted further publication.<endOfText>
<human>By the end of the War, the Nouvelle Revue Française people realised their mistake in refusing the novel in the first place, and with that erm commercial acumen which I think still characterises that particular publishing house, they now quickly obtained exclusive publication rights.<endOfText>
<bot>erm During the four years of war, however, erm and indeed right up to his death in nineteen twenty-two, Proust revised and enlarged his novel so much that it trebled in length, and the publication was not in fact completed until after his death in nineteen twenty-seven.<endOfText>
<human>Some indication of the immense editorial difficulties that arose, many of which I may say were not solved until the, the Pléiade edition in three volumes of nineteen fifty-four, some of the difficulty I think is hinted at, at any rate, in a recent description of the state of Proust's papers at the moment of his death, and I quote: ‘Huge packets of type- and manuscript, the pages festooned with half-illegible addenda, and blackened with savage deletions which had swallowed up entire paragraphs, heaped the ugly little bamboo table that stood near his death-bed, and overflowed from the shelves of the table along the top of the nearby chimneypiece.<endOfText>
<bot>Three of the seven sections of À la recherche du temps perdu still awaited publication, and although one had been typed and corrected, none of them was yet in proof.<endOfText>
<human>Among the papers that the novelist left behind him were many feverously scribbled notes, showing changes that he intended to make, and new episodes that, given the opportunity, he would have worked into his narrative.’<endOfText>
<bot>Turning more directly now to À la recherche itself, one can say I think that its many images of search and travel provide some justification for the sub-title of this talk, ‘The Novelist as Explorer’.<endOfText>
<human>The whole novel is in fact a voyage of exploration and discovery, erm exploration of the nature of reality and the eventual discovery of how this reality can be recreated for our detailed inspection by means of art.<endOfText>
<bot>And it's this journey from external reality to the profound truths of art, a journey which takes Proust through a series of investigations of the nature of time, the nature of the intellect, the nature of memory, it's this journey which I must now attempt to trace, and I perhaps just ought to say that I think I get abstract once or twice from this point onwards.<endOfText>
<human>I don't think it's so much the difficulty of the matter, as the inadequacy of the manner, but erm it  the main structure behind erm what I have to say at any rate revolves round these three successive ideas of time, intellect, memory.<endOfText>
<bot>If we seek to examine the external world of people and objects in terms of our own experience of that world, the fact of time is bound, I think, to be an important consideration.<endOfText>
<human>This is a truth which the late nineteenth century relearned, particularly in France, and in reaction to a predominantly static picture of reality implicit in much positivist and naturalist thought.<endOfText>
<bot>In fact in the eighteen nineties, I believe the seeds were being sown, of what has since been called the time obsession of the twentieth century.<endOfText>
<human>A new picture of a world characterised by flux, and thus a world not reducible to static intellectual categories, a picture of a world of flux was emerging, particularly clearly I suppose in the writings of Bergson.<endOfText>
<bot>Bergson held chronological time, time measured and divided into units, as a largely misleading human convention.<endOfText>
<human>What we actually experience, he argued, what we actually experience is duration, a continuous flowing and change, what he calls in a rather striking phrase, I think, ‘succession without divisibility’.<endOfText>
<bot>And of course this is rather like the distinction made by William Goulding in Free Fall.<endOfText>
<human>Some of you will remember that he makes a distinction between what he calls and I quote, ‘A dead thing.<endOfText>
<bot>The straight line from the first hiccough to the last gasp’, and human experience of time, which he describes as, and again I quote, ‘A memory.<endOfText>
<human>A sense of shuffle, fold and coil.<endOfText>
<bot>Of this day nearer than that because more important.<endOfText>
<human>Of that event mirroring this.<endOfText>
<bot>Or those three set apart, exceptional, and out of the straight line altogether’.<endOfText>
<human>Now the very title of Proust's novel, À la recherche du temps perdu erm underlines time as a major object of his own exploratory urge.<endOfText>
<bot>The first and last words of the novel, at fifteen volumes distance from each other, are in fact temporal expressions: ‘longtemps’ and ‘le temps’.<endOfText>
<human>erm ‘Longtemps’ and ‘le temps’.<endOfText>
<bot>And indeed he's preoccupied, I think, very much with the equivalent of Bergson's duration, or, if you like, Goulding's shuffle, fold and coil.<endOfText>
<human>This is frequently seen, of course, in the novel.<endOfText>
<bot>erm A very quick example would be the famous sentence in which Marcel, the narrator, says, ‘An hour is not merely an hour.<endOfText>
<human>It is a vessel filled with perfumes, sounds, projects, moods.’<endOfText>
<bot>And this distinction between an hour as sixty minutes and an hour as a section of complex human experience, is I suppose the distinction one would make between clock time and what might be called existential time, time as it's humanly experienced.<endOfText>
<human>One should perhaps just add at this point that Proust also underlines the very flexible nature of this existential time.<endOfText>
<bot>At another moment in the novel, the narrator writes: ‘The time which we have at our disposal each day is elastic.<endOfText>
<human>The passions we experience expand it, those we inspire in others contract it, and habit fills it.’<endOfText>
<bot>It's difficult, I think, just to grasp the implications of a statement like that immediately.<endOfText>
<human>I could perhaps put at least part of it in very homely erm and perhaps somewhat banal terms by saying that five minutes spent waiting for the person one loves may seem like five hours, whereas five hours spent with that person may appear a mere five minutes.<endOfText>
<bot>This insistence on human time as both flexible and, one might say, I suppose, multi-dimensional, has various consequences of course for the structure and the style of À la recherche.<endOfText>
<human>Because it rejects the straight line conception of time from the first hiccough to the last gasp, the novel is not built round a clear, sequential story, that might be summarised in a few paragraphs.<endOfText>
<bot>To read it is not to be entertained by ‘a good yarn’, but to share Proust's recreation of what he believes the nature, the quality, the, almost the texture, as it were, of various kinds of human experience, to be like.<endOfText>
<human>Equally obviously, the concern with shuffle, fold and coil, means frequent time shifts, prompted no doubt mainly by association and memory, time shifts between past and present.<endOfText>
<bot>The elastic narrative that results is one that has been given, I suppose one might say, a narrative that's given complex emotional shaping, rather than straight chronological form.<endOfText>
<human>This also means that the narrative tempo of the novel changes on many occasions, and on perhaps most occasions is particularly slow as a tempo.<endOfText>
<bot>Because like many of his near contemporaries, such, for instance, as Henry James and Virginia Woolf certainly, Proust was concerned to expand certain small but emotionally important blocks of time, to expand them so as to convey an experience fully and in detail, as one would experience it living through it.<endOfText>
<human>He sacrificed, he sacrificed the quick movement, the rapid changes of circumstance which a certain kind of reader demands, in order to match his description of thinking and feeling to the actual pace at which these things are experienced in real life.<endOfText>
<bot>Now turning from the structure very quickly to the style, one has I suppose to underline Proust's insistence that a writer's style must grow organically out of his thought, out of his conception of reality.<endOfText>
<human>Many of you will know that in the eighteenth century, Buffon had defined literary style as the order and movement which we impose on our thoughts.<endOfText>
<bot>Now Proust quite consciously stands this idea on its head, when he writes, and I quote, ‘Style is simply the order and movement which grow out of our thought.’<endOfText>
<human>‘Style is simply the order and movement which grow out of our thought.’<endOfText>
<bot>And consequently, given his own sense of the flowing, indivisible nature of duration, it's appropriate and inevitable on his own principle, that his prose should consist of long, flowing sentences, within often enormous paragraphs, and without division into chapters.<endOfText>
<human>Proust is also exceptionally aware I think of a, of the, the, the complex nature of reality, a reality built up in a number of layers, so that his sentences are made even longer than might otherwise have been the case, by the introduction of successive subordinate clauses, in which he seeks to qualify as precisely as possible what he is saying.<endOfText>
<bot>In which he seeks to introduce a sense of nuance, and in which he sometimes offers three or four possible different explanations of one particular human action, without adjudicating between them.<endOfText>
<human>His long sinuous phrases are designed to enclose the different levels and quirks of reality, just as liquid, spilt on a rough pavement, eventually seeps into every crack and cranny.<endOfText>
<bot>The style of the novel, in fact, like the structure, is used to attempt to convey in words certain sound rhythms as we actually experience them.<endOfText>
<human>erm It's not easy to give an example that's brief, because of what I've just said about the style, but I offer one very short passage here, which might or might not convey what I'm attempting to say.<endOfText>
<bot>It's a passage which reads as follows.<endOfText>
<human>In English.<endOfText>
<bot>In Anglo-Irish. erm ‘There was a small tap on the pane, as though something had struck it, followed by a light, though abundant falling, as though grains of sand were being dropped from a window above, and then a more intense and regular sound, which took on a rhythm and became fluid, resonant, musical, infinite, universal.<endOfText>
<human>It was raining.’<endOfText>
<bot>It's hardly possible to hear, in translation, the way in which the increasing tempo from the initial individual raindrops on the windowpane, to the final, single sound of the rain striking the window, it's difficult to convey the manner in which this is subtly rendered, I think, by length of phrasing, by using adjectives of increasing syllabic length, and so on, and perhaps just in this one particular case erm I, I might just read the passage, very quickly, in French.<endOfText>
<human>erm ‘Un petit coup au carreau, comme si quelque chose l'avait heurté, suivi d'une ample chute lègère, comme de grains de sable, qu'on eût laissés tomber d'une fenêtre audessus, puis la chute, s'étendant, se règlant, adoptant un rhythme, devenant fluide, sonore, musicale, inombrable, universelle.<endOfText>
<bot>C'était la pluit.’<endOfText>
<human>What I've just been saying about the importance of time and movement in Proust's novel give rise I think to a further question.<endOfText>
<bot>How do we make direct contact with this mobile, fluid reality?<endOfText>
<human>We usually assume that our minds can tell us a lot about what things are really like, but this is an idea which Proust, like Bergson, I may say, erm rather firmly rejects.<endOfText>
<bot>Bergson went so far as to describe intelligence, or the intellect, as being, and I quote, ‘characterised by a natural inability to comprehend life.’<endOfText>
<human>He argues that reality resembles a cinematographic film, a ceaseless unwinding an moving, but the intellect is so constituted, that it can only provide us with stills, separate and immobile, from that motion film which is reality.<endOfText>
<bot>Intelligence operates, in fact, through concepts which break up the flow of our experience, classifying it by isolated, lifeless categories, such as cause and effect, beginning and end, subject and object, and so on.<endOfText>
<human>On a number of occasions in the novel, the narrator Marcel himself refers to the intellect as a kind of lattice-work, with which we try to capture reality, but through which reality flows and escapes us.<endOfText>
<bot>He argues that intellectual concepts are fundamentally arbitrary, and says indeed at one point, ‘Ideas formulated by the pure intellect possess logical or potential truth only.’<endOfText>
<human>It's in this way I think that Proust clears the ground in order to claim that the artist, be he writer, painter, musician, can capture reality by means not open to and indeed mostly at variance with the discursive intellect.<endOfText>
<bot>The artist can do so by imagination, intuition, and the expressive resources of his particular art.<endOfText>
<human>And this is why at a late stage in À la recherche, Marcel says that it is a mistake, particularly where the artist is concerned, to accept, and I quote, ‘It's a mistake to accept things as they are in reality, names as they are written, people as photography and psychology give in an unalterable idea of them.’<endOfText>
<bot>‘As a matter of fact,’ he adds, ‘this is not at all what we ordinarily perceive.’<endOfText>
<human>This is a bit difficult, I think, to follow, and what Proust means perhaps becomes clearer in a story which he himself told on more than one occasion about the painter Turner.<endOfText>
<bot>It seems that Turner showed one of his drawings of Plymouth Sound, with several ships seen against a background of the setting sun, to a ship's officer.<endOfText>
<human>The officer promptly criticised the absence of portholes in the drawing.<endOfText>
<bot>erm Turner replied, ‘If you go up to the top of Mount Edgecombe, and look at the ships against the light, with the setting sun behind them, you will realise that one cannot distinguish the portholes.’<endOfText>
<human>‘But you know perfectly well that they have portholes,’ retorted the officer.<endOfText>
<bot>‘Yes, I know,’ said Turner.<endOfText>
<human>‘But my job is to draw what I see, not what I know.’<endOfText>
<bot>‘My job is to draw what I see, not what I know.’<endOfText>
<human>I suppose this might be taken as perhaps a basic statement of Impressionist doctrine, and we know, incidentally, that the fictional painter in À la recherche, Elstir, who plays a very important role in the novel, perhaps more important than either the fictional writer, Bergotte, or the fictional musician, Vinteuil, that Elstir was modelled in considerable part on Monet.<endOfText>
<bot>Elstir is described by the narrator as an artist who painted objects, and I quote, ‘not as he knew them to be, but according to the optical illusions of which our first sight of them is composed.’<endOfText>
<human>It's significant, I think, incidentally, that Elstir paints so many seascapes, since the restless flowing movement of reality is I suppose particularly obvious in, exemplified by the sea.<endOfText>
<bot>And when Marcel visits Elstir's studio, he's fascinated by the way in which the sea is sometimes painted as though it were part of the sky, and sometimes it looks as though the sky is part of the sea.<endOfText>
<human>These are paintings in fact in which the line of the horizon is fluid and changing in order to convey an optical illusion which is quite familiar to most of us, I think, by inspection on Brighton Front.<endOfText>
<bot>Elstir's paintings persuade Marcel of their truth, but it's a truth which is different from the intellectual truth which he first brought to his initial contemplation of those paintings, and Marcel says that in this way, by his art, Elstir frees us from the cramping tyranny of the intellect, by painting, and again I quote, ‘by painting some unusual picture of a familiar object.<endOfText>
<human>A picture different from those that we are accustomed to see, unusual and yet true to nature, and for that reason doubly impressive to us, because it startles us, and makes us emerge from our habits.’<endOfText>
<bot>This brief explanation of Elstir's originality as an artist might I think be applied equally appropriately to Proust, the novelist.<endOfText>
<human>By a combination of Impressionist vision, imagination, a magical mastery of language, Proust uses À la recherche to explore often banal objects, often apparently dull people, often apparently trivial episodes, in such a way that he recreates them with a freshness, erm a power of conviction, that persuade us we're actually seeing them with a privileged insight, or perhaps even seeing them for the first time.<endOfText>
<bot>Apart from this, Elstir's insistence on painting what his senses register, not what his mind believes, is connected with two features in À la recherche which ought to be mentioned I think however briefly.<endOfText>
<human>Firstly, Proust often describes the material world by means of kinetic imagery in the novel.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean by that that he attributes motion to what we know in our minds to be static, immobile, inanimate objects.<endOfText>
<human>For example, as Marcel drives along the winding road to Martinville, he describes the three spires of the church in terms of active movement, the spires exchange places, they come closer together, they draw further apart, they hide behind each other in turn.<endOfText>
<bot>erm And he describes them in these terms because of course this is how he sees them from different angles while rounding a series of bends on the road, so that in fact he describes the movement which his senses perceive, not the solid immobility to which his intellect testifies.<endOfText>
<human>On other occasions in a, in a different though I think related way, erm Proust shows that a phrase such as, for instance , ‘the Church of St. Hilaire’ is a piece of shorthand which the intellect employs to define and to stabilise and to make easy to deal with what is at the sense level a complicated and continually changing reality.<endOfText>
<bot>He therefore describes the very different appearances of the village church, the Church of St. Hilaire, its very different appearances on a spring day, on a misty autumn morning, on a summer morning, at midday, at five o-clock, in the late afternoon.<endOfText>
<human>And this attempt to embrace a constantly shifting reality reminds one of course of the various series of Monet, including of course the famous series of paintings of the west front of Rouen cathedral, seen at different times of the day, and during different seasons of the year.<endOfText>
<bot>But Proust also regards the world of people as being just as fluid and difficult to grasp, indeed more so, than the world of objects.<endOfText>
<human>At the beginning of this talk we found Marcel asking the question, ‘Who am I?’, and personality, whether it be the self or other selves, is seen by Proust as something so changeable and mysterious, that it's virtuously impossible to pin it down.<endOfText>
<bot>The result is that the main characters in À la Recherche are not by any means all of a piece.<endOfText>
<human>They're not, in Proust's own phrase, ‘as photography gives an unalterable idea of them’.<endOfText>
<bot>They are fascinating not least of all because they possess, even as characters in a novel, an aura of mystery and uncertainty.<endOfText>
<human>They have a dimension of being beyond the reach of rational formulation, and they often disconcert us by behaving quite differently in one novel, in one volume, from what the previous volume had led us to expect.<endOfText>
<bot>This view of people, and the shifting, changing, fluid evanescent reality which is a human being, this sense leads Proust to a particular theory which affects the way in which many of his characters behave towards one another.<endOfText>
<human>He sees what is nowadays called, I think, ‘inter-personal relations’ as being largely predicated on the need for people to convince themselves that they have a wholeness and a separateness and an individuality and a defined self, and they do this by trying to define themselves against those other shifting, evanescent erm personalities that they call their friends, enemies, wives, children and so on.<endOfText>
<bot>So erm because of his emphasis on the shifting, ill-defined nature of the self, Proust sees people as seeking chiefly in others, whether consciously or not, a confirmation of selfhood.<endOfText>
<human>And I think it's this, rather than his homosexuality, which largely explains Proust's extremely negative view of love.<endOfText>
<bot>For example, in the relationship between Marcel and Albertine, which is the chief of several memorable love affairs in the novel, we find Marcel feverishly seeking to understand himself, to define himself, in relation to Albertine.<endOfText>
<human>More than physical possession, in which, Proust says, one actually possesses nothing, Marcel seeks from Albertine reassurance concerning his own distinctiveness, his separateness, his individuality, and in Proust's conception of love, therefore, failure is inevitable, because despite the conventionally unifying language of love, what we seek at the most profound level is not contact with another person, but contact with ourselves.<endOfText>
<bot>And Proust concludes from this that erm when we believe ourselves to be in love, and I quote, ‘the bonds between us and the other person exist in our minds only.’<endOfText>
<human>Well, I move rapidly from these dispiriting erm thoughts erm to say something about the third and last point, the question of memory, because even could the artist recreate, in the way that I've tried to suggest, through an awareness of time, and through a, a rejection of the intellect, even if he could recreate in this way reality present to him in time, how is he to make contact with the past?<endOfText>
<bot>The attempt to answer the question, ‘Who am I?’ inevitably led Proust, as it leads his fictional hero, to explore and examine his past.<endOfText>
<human>In the novel, however, Marcel finds that this exploration mostly leads to a dead end, since the conscious effort of remembering, which is after all an effort of mind and will, is something which at best yields only a lifeless image of the past.<endOfText>
<bot>Marcel says repeatedly that what he calls ‘voluntary memory’ or ‘intellectual memory’fails to make the past truly live again.<endOfText>
<human>However early in the novel he has an experience which makes him aware of a significantly different kind of memory, and this is of course the famous incident in which as a young man he dips a small cake, a madeleine, into a cup of tea.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, the mere sight of the cake crumbs floating on the tea has no particular effect on him, but suddenly when he actually tastes them he gets a strange feeling of excitement, a feeling almost of elation.<endOfText>
<human>For some time he struggles to explain this feeling, and eventually he realises that the taste is of course exactly the taste which he enjoyed as a small boy when his Aunt Léonie gave him a madeline dipped in an infusion.<endOfText>
<bot>And the fact of having, and also of course of realising that he is having, the same experience as he, and the same sensation, as he'd experienced many years before, this sensation releases a whole set of associated feelings.<endOfText>
<human>The past becomes present to him with a total immediacy and a complete conviction which he says intellectual memory could never achieve.<endOfText>
<bot>Proust says that rather like those thin, flat pieces of coloured paper called Japanese flowers, which expand and become indeed three-dimensional when placed in water, similarly the taste of the madeleine brings back, not an abstract intellectual idea of the past, but the authentic sensation of his experiences as a small boy in the houses and the streets and the gardens of Combray.<endOfText>
<human>This type of remembering, which comes unbidden, through the sense of taste or touch or smell, is what Marcel of course calls ‘involuntary’ or ‘affective memory’, and in contrast to intellectual memory it recaptures past experience in its lived immediacy.<endOfText>
<bot>This privileged memory, spontaneously derived from sense association, is something of course that other writers, such as Châteaubriand, Nerval, Baudelaire, had pointed to before Proust.<endOfText>
<human>Nevertheless, if his discovery is less original than he claimed, he rightly says that his novel analyses the mechanism of involuntary memory in unique detail.<endOfText>
<bot>However, Proust's real originality, on this point, springs from the fact that he gave to the phenomenon of involuntary memory an aesthetic application.<endOfText>
<human>He found in its nature the means by which he could impart freshness, immediacy, spontaneity, imagination to his own vision as a writer.<endOfText>
<bot>In fact, eventually, the phenomenon, if you like the psychological phenomenon, of involuntary memory, become the creative principle of À la recherche.<endOfText>
<human>It is the mystery which Marcel explores throughout the course of the novel, the intuition which he finally learns to understand and use, the revelation, ultimately, the revelation of his distinctive vocation as an artist.<endOfText>
<bot>I think it explains in large measure why as we read the novel we are frequently struck by its quite special ring of truth, by its memorable rendering of the physical world, by a profound insight into human experience.<endOfText>
<human>Indeed with involuntary memory as the creative principle, one might almost dare to say that the opposition between poetry and the analytical is removed, because perhaps one of Proust's greatest achievements as a novelist is the way in which he reveals poetry and imaginative perception as the most appropriate and authentic means by which our human experience can be both understood and recreated for ourselves and for others.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, I know many would not agree with this.<endOfText>
<human>erm I take refuge in the fact that this is what Proust says, and I report, erm I think this amounts to claiming that the artist can give us privileged insight into life.<endOfText>
<bot>That I do believe.<endOfText>
<human>erm That art possesses some form of saving truth, and this is certainly Proust's belief.<endOfText>
<bot>François Mauriac quite rightly observed, I think, that God is terribly absent from À la recherche.<endOfText>
<human>And indeed, it's a novel which offers not salvation through erm a recognisable religion, but rather something like salvation through art.<endOfText>
<bot>Because Proust saw involuntary memory, which after all causes the past to coalesce with the present, he saw involuntary memory as a means of abolishing time, however provisionally, however briefly, and in this way the artist takes on a God-like role, since through his art he can free the individual from time, and to this extent confer immortality on that individual.<endOfText>
<human>In the final volume, Proust speaks of involuntary memory as being used in art, being used in such a way that, and I quote, ‘this moment, freed from the bondage of time, recreates within us the sensation of a self freed from the bondage of time.’<endOfText>
<bot>I'm conscious of having talked about Proust's novel in somewhat forbiddingly abstract terms, in the sense that I choose to talk about time, intellect, memory.<endOfText>
<human>I've said little about the rich descriptive skill, the human insight with which he leads the reader through humorous happenings, tragic episodes, through the follies of social manoeuvring and the deceptions of love, through a portrait gallery of adolescent girls, aging homosexuals, upstart socialites, and solidly sensible servants, to an eventual understanding of his, Marcel's, artistic vocation.<endOfText>
<bot>Yet Proust insisted, himself, in a letter to Gide, that he was incapable of narrating anything in which he was not primarily seeking to grasp a general truth.<endOfText>
<human>And since I believe that criticism cannot be a substitute for the reading of the novel, I've been content to sketch some of the general truths which I think lie behind it, and a familiarity with which would I think help to illuminate an eventual reading of À la recherche du temps perdu.<endOfText>
<bot>These general truths culminate in a final illumination, an ultimate discovery, brought back by Proust from his exploration of time, intellect, memory, and this discovery, this final illumination, is I think his assertion that there exists an extra-temporal and infinitely potent reality which only great art can express.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>Today, Tony McCaffery talks about some aspects of chemistry, becoming a chemistry student, and the importance of research in maintaining good chemistry teaching.<endOfText>
<human>But first, Jenny Payne gives us her view of the University from the viewpoint of the Information Office.<endOfText>
<bot>If you should ever telephone the University, there's a pretty fair chance that you'll be put through to Jenny.<endOfText>
<human>But does she know all the answers?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, we do our best or try to pass people on to other people who would know the answer.<endOfText>
<human>We get really weird things at times.<endOfText>
<bot>What sort of weird things can you think of?<endOfText>
<human>Well, oddities.<endOfText>
<bot>We've had somebody ringing up for their crossword puzzle, can we fill in the clue to that?<endOfText>
<human>Did you manage to fill in the clue?<endOfText>
<bot>I'm not sure that we could, actually.<endOfText>
<human>My goodness.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, that's very bad, or could you pass them on to somebody that could, could do the crossword?<endOfText>
<human>Well, you have to be terribly diplomatic.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't imagine that erm somebody would be, like to be interrupted in the middle of lecture to answer somebody's crossword puzzles, you have to be diplomatic about things like that.<endOfText>
<human>It's not part of the University's public service.<endOfText>
<bot>We don't see it quite as part of our role, no.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>So what other things happen in your Information Office?<endOfText>
<human>Well, we get the usual sort of things you would expect, about fact and figures about the University itself.<endOfText>
<bot>We provide a service not only for the six thousand odd people that are on the campus <endOfText>
<human>Six thousand odd people!<endOfText>
<bot>That's a heck of a lot of people.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, it is.<endOfText>
<bot>They're not all students, presumably.<endOfText>
<human>No, we've got about four thousand five hundred students.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>And the rest are lecturers and other staff, and then various other units are on campus, and also now we have some industry people on campus.<endOfText>
<bot>We have two high technology companies <endOfText>
<human>mhm<endOfText>
<bot>Which have recently come onto the campus, and they work with some of our scientists here .<endOfText>
<human>Oh, I see.<endOfText>
<bot>Are they, are they part of the University, or are they entirely separate from the University?<endOfText>
<human>No, they're, they're separate.<endOfText>
<bot>They have an arrangement with the University and they have their own buildings, and they collaborate with the people here, mostly in Engineering.<endOfText>
<human>So it's a bit like a science park at <endOfText>
<bot>It is.<endOfText>
<human>at the University.<endOfText>
<bot>We haven't actually called it a science park but it's something on that line, yes.<endOfText>
<human>mhm And, and you had to provide information about them, apart from everything else.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes, and we deal with the press a lot of course, but you, as I say you do get calls from anybody, about anything.<endOfText>
<human>It can be about other universities.<endOfText>
<bot>erm Brighton generally, Sussex, anything anybody thinks they don't know and then they think the University would know, and they just ring us up, which I suppose somebody on the campus will know, but you don't always, can't be able to find them always, so it's quite difficult.<endOfText>
<human>Well, every day a different challenge <endOfText>
<bot>mhm That's right.<endOfText>
<human>It certainly sounds like that.<endOfText>
<bot>Tell me, what are the changes that have taken place in the University over the past few years?<endOfText>
<human>We don't hear so much about student problems these days.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>A few years back there was quite a lot of trouble.<endOfText>
<bot>It was really only a very small group of students involved, but they got a lot of publicity and I think over the last few years it's changed quite a lot.<endOfText>
<human>Students seem much more inclined to knuckle down to the work and not get involved in quite such dramatic protests as they were before.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you think there's any particular reason for this?<endOfText>
<human>Are they worried about getting jobs, or <endOfText>
<bot>Oh, I'm sure it's partly that, yes, yes.<endOfText>
<human>So you think the students are quieter and, and working harder now than they used to.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, I think the majority always have worked hard, but they, some of them became quite flamboyant and extravagant in their gestures about what they, how they wanted to change things, and I think nowadays they, perhaps sadly, really, they feel they, they can't so they just knuckle down to it all.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, it sounds to me as if you miss the days when there was a bit more action on,<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, I wouldn't say that .<endOfText>
<human>on the campus.<endOfText>
<bot>All right, I won't quote you.<endOfText>
<human>Don't listen, anyone, to what she's saying, she denies it.<endOfText>
<bot>How about the, the cuts?<endOfText>
<human>I mean we're all worried in, in the world about cuts in various areas and the education area has its share of the cuts, we know the teachers are worried about their salaries and what's going on in the schools, and even we hear from the University from time to time that they, things aren't as they used to be.<endOfText>
<bot>How are the cuts affecting the University?<endOfText>
<human>Oh, in many ways.<endOfText>
<bot>There's been something like twenty per cent cut over the last few years and erm some faculty members have taken early retirement and left, so a lot of subjects have lost some of their most able people.<endOfText>
<human>erm There's not much opportunity for job advancement, there are fewer opportunities to rise up the scale and become Readers or Professors and so on.<endOfText>
<bot>In other areas there have been cutbacks.<endOfText>
<human>erm There are fewer administrative staff to deal with, really, more problems, in a way, because though we have fewer students than we did before, there's still more work involved and we can't, we don't, we no longer have a planning period.<endOfText>
<bot>Once upon a time you used to have a five year planning period, and that has now disappeared, so we live hand to mouth, and the Finance Officer manages marvellously in juggling things round, but one can no longer plan as one used to, and therefore it's rather sad really, because people no longer have the chance to develop things as they would wish to.<endOfText>
<human>But how's it left the University? erm Are people terribly depressed?<endOfText>
<bot>Is, is the place a bad place now because it can't <endOfText>
<human>Oh, no, no <endOfText>
<bot>afford to run properly?<endOfText>
<human>It's not a bad place, but erm I think in common with a lot of other universities, well, all universities, some of the excitement, enthusiasm has gone, because people no longer have the chance to do what they would want to do.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, dear.<endOfText>
<human>It sound a little bit depressing.<endOfText>
<bot>Still, you've got a Silver Jubilee Year this year.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, yes, I'm looking forward to that very much, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>And you're going to celebrate what's left?<endOfText>
<human>Oh, yes!<endOfText>
<bot>And celebrate a prosperous future, one hopes.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, yes, I'm sure it will be.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, let's hope it is for, for you and all your colleagues and of course all the students, Jenny Payne.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>Chemistry, to many of us, is a little bit like cookery.<endOfText>
<human>Take a pinch of this and a pinch of that, stir well under a slow heat, and see what happens.<endOfText>
<bot>But in reality, modern chemistry is a much more precise science, as Tony McCaffery, Dean of the School of Molecular Sciences, would be the first to point out.<endOfText>
<human>Are there many students studying science at Sussex, and in particular, is Chemistry a popular subject?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, yes, there are quite a few.<endOfText>
<human>There's a large number of undergraduates that's studying for the B S C degree, and a very substantial number of postgraduate students studying for the Masters degree or the Doctor of Philosophy.<endOfText>
<bot>So Sussex is a university with quite a high status in terms of science.<endOfText>
<human>In terms of research it has a very high status indeed, and is one of the leading erm scientific research centres in the country.<endOfText>
<bot>erm For undergraduate teaching it also has a very high reputation for innovation and for creative teaching.<endOfText>
<human>Now, there's a lot of controversy sometimes about getting into universities, and I want to ask you, is it very difficult to get into a university these days?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, course, erm like most things you have to work at it.<endOfText>
<human>You can't just walk in off the street and say ‘I want to study a degree in neurophysiology or erm or chemistry even.’<endOfText>
<bot>You must prepare yourself for it in the erm in the time-honoured way, which is to erm acquire A-levels or erm an Open University qualification or a Higher National Certificate or something of that kind.<endOfText>
<human>Once that's accepted, then it's relatively straightforward.<endOfText>
<bot>Is it particularly difficult to get in as a chemist, for example?<endOfText>
<human>Well Chemistry of course is, is traditionally much easier in many ways than English or some other subjects, and this reflects the esteem held amongst schoolteachers and students of the sciences as opposed to the arts.<endOfText>
<bot>erm By comparison in A-level grades it's easier to get in at Sussex in Chemistry than it is in English.<endOfText>
<human>I see.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you sure you've got that the right way round?<endOfText>
<human>It sounds to me as if there are too many people that want to get into Sussex in English, and not so many that wanting to get Chemistry.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, that's quite right.<endOfText>
<human>The erm number of applicants for English is very high indeed.<endOfText>
<bot>Chemistry it's not as high as we would like, and certainly not as high as erm our status in research erm would suggest erm and we feel that the perhaps there's some image-building still to be done in this field.<endOfText>
<human>I see.<endOfText>
<bot>One of the things that a lot of people are concerned about these days is, is the future of higher education.<endOfText>
<human>There are lots of screams coming from universities about them being hard done by, being cut back financially and so on so forth.<endOfText>
<bot>How do you see the future of higher education?<endOfText>
<human>Well I, I take the implicit point that erm we're all suffering cuts throughout the country, therefore why shouldn't higher education suffer similar cuts, but of course, higher education is in a different category to erm many other fields that the government pays for and sponsors, in that higher education is investment in the future, and therefore, if Britain is to survive erm as a, a nation of erm of some economic standing, is to well in the national, in the international stakes, then we must be innovative, we must create new things, and we must erm in, in that, to do that we must invest very strongly in higher education.<endOfText>
<bot>And you would couple higher education in the terms of, in the sense of teaching students, with doing research in educational institutions presumably?<endOfText>
<human>I think that's an absolutely essential part of a higher education institution such as a university.<endOfText>
<bot>Without some knowledge of research it's very hard to keep your teaching fresh and lively and interesting and relevant, and the other factor is of course that research contributes to the long-term economic base of the country.<endOfText>
<human>mhm I find that very interesting, because I, I suspect many members of the general public think of universities where primarily students are taught.<endOfText>
<bot>They don't think of them as places where research goes on.<endOfText>
<human>But you were telling me that there's a lot of research that goes on in the universities.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh indeed there is, yes.<endOfText>
<human>I mean what sort of, take a, take a university teacher, a university don, for example.<endOfText>
<bot>What percentage of their time would they spend actually on doing research as opposed to teaching?<endOfText>
<human>Well this varies from individual to individual, but there are individuals who probably spend erm seventy per cent of their time on research, erm twenty per cent on teaching, and ten per cent on playing tennis.<endOfText>
<bot>But there are erm others who, for whom teaching is the major aspect and the major important role that they perceive for themselves erm but there is always a balance and on balance, taken over the whole system, I should think that most people spend fifty or sixty per cent of their time on research.<endOfText>
<human>erm Teaching is erm an important function, but not erm the only function of a university teacher.<endOfText>
<bot>mhm Well that's a lot of time to spend.<endOfText>
<human>And obviously it, it erm underlines your comment that research is very important.<endOfText>
<bot>You said that it was important because of the national economy.<endOfText>
<human>In what sense do you mean that?<endOfText>
<bot>Well.<endOfText>
<human>erm In a wide range of senses, really.<endOfText>
<bot>First of all there are people in universities who are inventing things which will be used next year or the year after or the year after that.<endOfText>
<human>For example there are people who are developing new plastics on industrial contracts erm within a department with our school.<endOfText>
<bot>There are others who are doing research which might lead to erm developments in the communications industry in twenty years from now, or in ten years from now.<endOfText>
<human>erm It's often long-range, strategic research which people are doing which erm it will contribute in ten or twenty years' time, provided that industry picks it up appropriately.<endOfText>
<bot>But there are other cases where research is being done which will be used next year.<endOfText>
<human>Could you give me an example of that?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, I certainly could.<endOfText>
<human>In our Polymer Research Group, there are erm people doing research on novel plastics for erm credit cards, for additives to plastics which you use for credit cards, to give bank cards and credit cards a longer lifetime.<endOfText>
<bot>There are others who are working on erm ways in which banknotes can be, the lifetime of banknotes and library books erm in the paper industry can be erm lengthened, so that our erm library books will last longer.<endOfText>
<human>erm These sound very very interesting projects, and they're all taking place at Sussex?<endOfText>
<bot>Those I mentioned are taking place currently at Sussex, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Lastly, do you think we as a country spend enough money on research?<endOfText>
<human>Well, we, we do spend a very substantial fraction of our gross national, national product on research.<endOfText>
<bot>However, a major fraction of that goes into military research.<endOfText>
<human>erm The fraction going into civil research, of this speculative kind, or of a development kind, is very small compared to all the countries of Western Europe.<endOfText>
<bot>erm It's smaller even than Italy and erm and almost as low as Greece.<endOfText>
<human>So I, I believe we don't spend anywhere near as much as we should do.<endOfText>
<bot>But in spite of not having enough money, Sussex is still active and perhaps in the forefront of the scientific research.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, because we get a larger than average slice of what is available.<endOfText>
<bot>And what's your particular line?<endOfText>
<human>My own line is studying the effect of lasers on chemical reactions to see if lasers can be used to stimulate or generate new novel types of chemical process.<endOfText>
<bot>And can they?<endOfText>
<human>erm There are indications that in perhaps twenty years' time that there might be  some novel applications of lasers.<endOfText>
<bot>It's too early yet to say whether erm it will revolutionise the chemical industry.<endOfText>
<human>Well, Tony McCaffery, good luck for the next twenty years.<endOfText>
<bot>Join us next<endOfText>
<human>And welcome to another programme in our series of Ideas in Action.<endOfText>
<bot>One of the features that worry people about modern society is the fear that it is becoming more violent.<endOfText>
<human>Scarcely a day passes without us reading in the newspapers or seeing on television assaults, batteries, violent acts of all kinds.<endOfText>
<bot>Richard Clutterbuck is a lecturer in Law in our School of Social Sciences at the University, and he's taken a particular interest into legal aspects of violence in society.<endOfText>
<human>Now, violence is not exactly a new phenomenon in society, is it?<endOfText>
<bot>It's been around a long time, as they say?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I think that's true, but at the same time there is a debate going on as to whether in fact there's more violence now than there used to be, some people say there is more violence, other people say that, that erm that's not the case.<endOfText>
<bot>Violence appears in many shapes and forms in society.<endOfText>
<human>Violence may be the erm scenes that we've been witnessing of terrorism lately, or it may simply be a boxing match, or a rugby match, or something like that.<endOfText>
<bot>So we need to be clear as to what we define as violence, and how we see violence in society.<endOfText>
<human>I would like to say that, that the level of violence has been fairly static, but at the same time we are able to tolerate certain levels of violence.<endOfText>
<bot>We all accept, for example, pushing and jostling on the Underground.<endOfText>
<human>We all accept the physical free-for-all which passes for the January sales.<endOfText>
<bot>I suppose you, you would say that violence is what is socially acceptable in a given context.<endOfText>
<human>You mentioned boxing and that's a sort of legitimate violence which takes place in a limited area and which people watch because presumably they enjoy it, but don't wish to particularly partake in themselves, and whereas it's all right for people to punch each other 's heads in the boxing ring, they would object to people coming outside the boxing ring and punching the spectators' heads.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that's right.<endOfText>
<human>I think that our attitudes towards violence do change.<endOfText>
<bot>We were willing to accept bare knuckle fights a hundred and fifty years ago, we're unwilling to accept them today.<endOfText>
<human>Today within the margins of acceptability we find professional boxing.<endOfText>
<bot>It's being erm boxing as a sport is being erm eradicated in schools, and it may be that in, in the future, maybe the none too distant future that boxing ceases to be acceptable.<endOfText>
<human>We still accept physical contact games like rugby.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's move on to perhaps some of the legal aspects and some of the areas where we are actually concerned about violence at the moment.<endOfText>
<human>In the streets, for example, how can you actually decide whether a violent act has taken place or not?<endOfText>
<bot>It seems to me that it must be a very fine line must be drawn a violent act and a non-violent act.<endOfText>
<human>The, the area of law here is bedevilled by many layers of discretion.<endOfText>
<bot>erm For example if erm two people are walking down the street and there's a certain amount of jostling, then the victim, if he is a victim, may well consider that it's not violent, or that it's nothing out of the ordinary, or that it's something which is acceptable, and then not take the matter any farther.<endOfText>
<human>If the victim reports it to a police officer, the police officer has an element of discretion whether to take the matter any farther, whether to give a warning, whether to get involved or not.<endOfText>
<bot>Sometimes actually bringing in the agencies of the law may be like pouring oil on a fire rather than pouring water on a fire.<endOfText>
<human>And then beyond that there are the layers of discretion at the prosecution stage and in the court.<endOfText>
<bot>It seems to me that we have not a very consistent to this.<endOfText>
<human>If, if I walked up to a policeman in the street and gave him a little shove, the chances are he would arrest me, unless it was done in a totally friendly way.<endOfText>
<bot>On the other hand, if I was on a picket line or somewhere, I could give him a pretty hard old shove without pulled in, I would imagine.<endOfText>
<human>erm That may well be the caricature picture.<endOfText>
<bot>I wouldn't like to go that far myself.<endOfText>
<human>Certainly discretion is exercised by human beings, and those human beings are subject to all the, the frailties of humanity, and in many situations the policeman is in a tense but essentially human situation, where he has to make snap decisions on the spot.<endOfText>
<bot>And those snap decisions may be influenced as much by his surroundings and the circumstances in which he finds himself, as by some rational academic view of what is actually going on.<endOfText>
<human>Isn't the situation really, erm taking it erm group violence, if I could put it that way, isn't it a question really checks and balances.<endOfText>
<bot>In a sense the whole point of making a group protest, for example, is that you can actually display some strong feelings or other, and isn't the, the point achieving a balance between some acceptable way of maybe even physically showing your disapproval of something and something which goes over the boundaries, actually ends up with damage being done to people or property?<endOfText>
<human>Sure.<endOfText>
<bot>Group violence has two elements which are a little worrying.<endOfText>
<human>One is that the, the presence of a large number of people can cause intimidation, can cause the apprehension of violence.<endOfText>
<bot>That is worrying to people.<endOfText>
<human>That is one of the things about mass pickets and mass demonstrations which people do find worrying.<endOfText>
<bot>And large numbers can physically cause severe damage which could not be caused by a smaller number of people.<endOfText>
<human>I suppose the, the example of that is where a house wall was pushed in by the, the mass that was thronging outside the Brunwick gates.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think there was any erm suggestion that that was a preconceived plan, it just happened because there were thousands of people in a space which was patently insufficient for that number of people.<endOfText>
<human>The other element of group violence is of course, if there are a group of people throwing bricks at the police, or chanting or swearing at people wanting to go to work from a picket line, the law, the criminal law is designed to prove guilt against an individual for an individual's conduct according to the preordained laws, whether they be statute law or common law.<endOfText>
<bot>And the question is, is the this individual guilty of this particular act and does this particular act contravene the law?<endOfText>
<human>Where you have a group of people and a brick comes out of the group and lands on a policeman's head, then it's very difficult for the law to attach individual and specific guilt to a particular individual.<endOfText>
<bot>This is one of the problems under which the law labours, because of course, if we didn't accept that it's individual guilt that counts, and we looked to group guilt, then that in itself is an infringement of civil liberties and human rights, you are being judged not according to your acts but according to the acts of others erm with whom you happened to associate, even though your conduct may not in itself be reprehensible.<endOfText>
<human>To what extent does the law deal with events which have taken place, and to what extent does the law deal with events which might take place?<endOfText>
<bot>In other word prevention as opposed to dealing with events which have already gone past?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>In the old films erm the saying was from one conduct to another, ‘Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.’<endOfText>
<human>I think in terms of public order and violence on the streets, then it's to court disaster to wait until the disruption actually happens.<endOfText>
<bot>The law does provide a battery of preventative powers available to the police and others, after all, every member of the public, every citizen has a duty to erm prevent a breach of the peace occurring in his presence.<endOfText>
<human>So it's not only a duty that, that's laid on the police.<endOfText>
<bot>But these preventative powers do exist, because once violence occurs on the streets, once there has been a breakdown of public order, then the damage has been done.<endOfText>
<human>Violence in society, I think, is rather like a fire.<endOfText>
<bot>From the moment of its inception, the fire causes damage.<endOfText>
<human>As soon as any outbreak of violence, however mild, occurs in society, then damage is done, if it's only to the social fabric of society, because one or two people cannot go about their business, cannot go about their pleasure, in the way in which they would wish to.<endOfText>
<bot>But the law normally deals with events which have taken place.<endOfText>
<human>The criminal law is normally concerned with things which have occurred.<endOfText>
<bot>A problem here is the function of the law.<endOfText>
<human>erm What do we see the function of any particular area of law or in particular any area of the criminal law?<endOfText>
<bot>One function is to, to visit retribution or sanctions upon people who have broken the law.<endOfText>
<human>Well that's okay for some crimes.<endOfText>
<bot>erm But in terms of public order crimes, it may well be that this sort of view does not act as a preventative to erm prevent the same thing happening again.<endOfText>
<human>After all, many groups which take to the streets are looking for publicity.<endOfText>
<bot>And when you look at the price of hiring thirty seconds of advertisement time on television and organising a mass demonstration with some gratuitous violence which will get thirty seconds in a T V news broadcast, erm then I think the cost-efficiency graph shows that the erm violent demonstration is the better way, in those terms.<endOfText>
<human>The old erm violence in society was dealt with largely with the Public Order Act of nineteen thirty-six, but recently we've had introduced a new Act through Parliament.<endOfText>
<bot>How does the new Act differ from the old one?<endOfText>
<human>In some ways the new Act is something which has provoked a lot of discussion.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that the bill which we first saw may well not be the bill that is eventually produced at the end of the day.<endOfText>
<human>But it looks likely that we will get a new statutory regime relating to public order offences.<endOfText>
<bot>Some of the major points erm of the old Public Order Act are reintroduced in the new Act.<endOfText>
<human>For example, the controls in the old Public Order Act Section Three over processions are reintroduced.<endOfText>
<bot>There is a new requirement that people organising demonstrations and processions in the streets should tell the police at least a week in advance, which is a good thing.<endOfText>
<human>But now these controls over processions have been erm extended to cover static large meetings, and erm I would think that at the back of the draftsman's mind was the spectre of mass pickets, things like that.<endOfText>
<bot>The earlier part of the bill as it's, in its current form, erm puts on a statutory basis several of the old common law offences, such as riot, erm affray, unlawful assembly.<endOfText>
<human>These were an amorphous group of crimes.<endOfText>
<bot>erm They have had periods when they were prosecuted, then they dropped out of fashion, now they have recently been revived over the last twenty years by prosecutors.<endOfText>
<human>All through this they've cried out for a modern definition.<endOfText>
<bot>In parts we have been given that modern definition.<endOfText>
<human>This should make life a little easier for the prosecutor, but let's not forget that the prosecutor only deals in terms of the crimes, with violence that has occurred, and the violence that has occurred is of course something which has gone wrong in society.<endOfText>
<bot>So the Act is not in itself going to do anything to prevent violence actually occurring.<endOfText>
<human>Can you define the crime more precisely?<endOfText>
<bot>It seems to me it's almost impossible to do so, because what is threatening and abusive in one situation wouldn't be in another.<endOfText>
<human>Sure.<endOfText>
<bot>There is the problem of context, and the problem of context is dealt with at present by discretion.<endOfText>
<human>erm In many cases where Section Five is invoked, erm the only witness is the police officer erm on the spot, and the court case is simply a slanging match between the policeman who says ‘This was said,’ and the individual who says, ‘No, I didn't say it, someone else did,’or occasionally somebody will argue, ‘No, that wasn't threatening, it wasn't abusive, it wasn't insulting.’<endOfText>
<bot>The issue of whereby a breach of the peace is likely to be occasioned is also a question of judgement, and it would be somewhat unusual for a court erm perhaps erm months later to go against the policeman's view, a view formed in the heat of the moment, where he had a firsthand erm taste of what was going on.<endOfText>
<human>Lastly, do you think the new laws, the new erm Act is going to be an improvement?<endOfText>
<bot>Will it help deal with violence in society?<endOfText>
<human>I'm not sure that we should talk in terms of any laws helping us to prevent violence in society.<endOfText>
<bot>It may well be that if you set the penalties so high, and if you can have a hundred per cent detection, then there may well be a deterrent element in these crimes, but basically the law is clearing up a mess, and the mess has occurred, and then the law comes along and does the best it can.<endOfText>
<human>erm The police have often described themselves as erm in the following way, that society throws its problems into the dustbin and asks the policeman to sit on the lid.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, erm perhaps extending that, it's not just the policeman but it's the law and the law enforcement agencies that are sitting on the lid of violence here.<endOfText>
<human>The trick is to prevent violence occurring in the first place.<endOfText>
<bot>erm The new Public Order Act may have some deterrent elements, but the tensions which provoke violence will probably be sufficiently great to override the deterrent elements in this Act.<endOfText>
<human>Richard Clutterbuck, thank you very much for talking to us.<endOfText>
<bot>In last week's programme I talked to Steven Medcalfe about novels, and asked him what makes a good read.<endOfText>
<human>Steven suggested Spenser and Shakespeare, with perhaps Scott and Hardy, and if I insisted on an up-to-date author, William Goulding.<endOfText>
<bot>Later, and as a contrast, I talked to John Whitley, who's Dean of the School of English and American studies, because I know that he's an enthusiast and an expert on the modern detective story.<endOfText>
<human>I started by asking John whether he was a Raymond Chandler fan.<endOfText>
<bot>I have a, a considerable interest in popular fiction, though I should add perhaps that Steven Medcalfe is very interested in detective stories, too.<endOfText>
<human>I, my interest lies particularly I think in the kind of erm popular fiction written in America between the wars, though it has to some extent carried on since World War Two.<endOfText>
<bot>This fiction has various names: ‘private eye fiction’, ‘hardboiled fiction’ which is a way of describing its style, and erm I have been interested in this for some time, partly trying to assess the reasons why such fiction occurred in America as a complete breakaway from the old kind of detective fiction which we all know about, the country house murder, why erm the figure of the private detective becomes so important in this kind of fiction between the wars, and what the relationship of this sort of fiction is to not merely other kinds of American fiction during that period but to more abiding American themes, particularly erm themes of individualism and toughness.<endOfText>
<human>I have found that erm it seems basically to be a very pessimistic kind of fiction, more pessimistic than people have often given it credit for, largely because they tend to see, for example in Dashiell Hammett, who's the author I'm most interested in from this period, erm a precursor of a lot of heroes, private eyes, who were said to have a very kind of steely moral integrity, which they balance against a general corruption in the world outside, and it does seem to me that in fact with Hammett the detective mirrors the corruption of that world as much as he stands against it, so that it does seem to me rather pessimistic.<endOfText>
<bot>I would add that erm that is of course not my only interest erm but some of my other interests are very much related to it.<endOfText>
<human>I am interested in much earlier American fiction, say in the period between seventeen eighty and eighteen thirty.<endOfText>
<bot>You mentioned Scott a moment ago, and Scott is certainly a profound influence on American fiction in the erm earlier part of the nineteenth century.<endOfText>
<human>I'm interested in the romantic novel, and erm in the way in which certain kinds of English fiction affect American models in this period, which continues in a way my interest in popular fiction, because the American fiction really takes as its model in the late eighteenth century, the early nineteenth century, not in fact so much the mainstream British fiction of the eighteenth century, we think of Defoe or Fielding or Richardson or Smollett, these don't provide very suitable models for American writers during that period because they're all models based on the assumption of a fixed kind of society.<endOfText>
<bot>I then asked John whether in recent years America was producing good literature, and what he thought of popular authors such as James Michener.<endOfText>
<human>Well, having talked about my interest in, in popular literature I suppose I should begin by saying I don't much like the distinction between good literature and pulp literature but, on the other hand, I do accept that it has a function.<endOfText>
<bot>I have no interest myself in Michener or a lot of the writers of very long sagas erm who have made a great deal of money out of it.<endOfText>
<human>I asked John what are modern American writers he would regard as outstanding.<endOfText>
<bot>I had in mind Vladimir Nabokov, if you're willing to consider him as an American writer, John Barth, Richard Brortigan, Robert Coover. erm As I say they're all writers who might come under the heading of, of postmodern meta-fiction writers who do not take for granted that fiction has a, a direct and clearly understandable relationship with society so that it can erm give you a very clear picture of society at a given moment, which was generally the case in the, with British fiction in the nineteenth century.<endOfText>
<human>They assume that erm it's very difficult to talk about reality, that reality means different things to different people, that people create in many ways their own reality, and they're interested in the process therefore of fiction-making, they're interested in erm how people create their own fictions, so that it becomes almost an endless series of mirrors, novelists writing novels about novelists writing novels and so on.<endOfText>
<bot>This isn't of course the only kind of fiction in America in this period.<endOfText>
<human>Part of the richness naturally of American fiction is erm that there are so many writers with so many different backgrounds, so many different ethnic backgrounds.<endOfText>
<bot>erm The Jewish novelist in America of course has become much more influential since the Second World War, particularly Saul Bellow, who won a Nobel Prize, erm Philip Roth, erm Bernard Malamud.<endOfText>
<human>Black novelists, of course, have become quite prominent.<endOfText>
<bot>One of the greatest novels, I think, in America since the Second World War is by a black novelist, Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man erm and of course Baldwin comes to mind, but there are many others.<endOfText>
<human>erm The more recent developments in erm women's fiction, feminist fiction, erm the lead has come there certainly from America so that not only do you have leading erm women novelists but you have leading women black novelists and black women novelists  and this erm of course may very well come, and I hope it does, in this country, but it hasn't come at the moment.<endOfText>
<bot>erm Novelists in this country, it seems to me, are drawn from a much narrower social band, and you cannot have this ethnic richness, this melting pot richness, erm that American fiction has very clearly demonstrated I think since the Second World War.<endOfText>
<human>Perhaps we could conclude by returning to the subject we started with, and that's the detective story.<endOfText>
<bot>mhm<endOfText>
<human>Why do you find detective stories so interesting?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I think I would emphasise that it is this particular kind of detective story that I find interesting.<endOfText>
<human>I have always liked to read the Golden Age detective stories, if you like, the country house murder mysteries, but I would have to admit that reading those is to some extent desire for stasis, a desire erm for a particularly safe kind of world, where everything works out in the end, because that's usually what happens, and so these days I tend only to take very small doses of that particular medicine.<endOfText>
<bot>But the private eye, hardboiled fiction I think has much more to do with erm American themes, with difficulties of erm establishing identity in American society, with erm  It seems to be a much more pliable instrument.<endOfText>
<human>It can deal erm with much more difficult and dangerous things than the classic detective novel in England.<endOfText>
<bot>If I take one example as more updated version of Hammett and Chandler, one of the most successful writers I think in financial terms in America since the Second World War has been a man called Kenneth Miller, who writes under the name of Ross Macdonald, and has been turning out for, oh, the best part of thirty years now, novels about a Californian private eye called Lou Archer.<endOfText>
<human>A couple of them have been turned into erm movies with, with Paul Newman.<endOfText>
<bot>And Archer is a detective who is a very much more human detective than Sherlock Holmes or Miss Marple or any of that line.<endOfText>
<human>He is a combination detective, father-confessor, erm psychologist, and the books, although they are somewhat repetitive if you were to read them one after the other, through quite a number, they nonetheless deal I think with very profound erm and difficult themes in American culture.<endOfText>
<bot>They deal very much with the breakup of the family.<endOfText>
<human>The figure of the lost youth, the lost child is very prominent erm in those books, there is partly an autobiographical element.<endOfText>
<bot>He's very interested in problems of ecology.<endOfText>
<human>Living in California he would be, but I mean one of his books is about, erm or has, as one very important element, a forest fire.<endOfText>
<bot>Another has an oil slick off the Californian coast, and the oil slick is not introduced in that novel purely for local interest, local colour, but is in fact a fundamental part of the themes of the novel, because the murders, the crimes involved take place within the family of the, the people who are oil millionaires, so that the oil slick is made to be an example of moral corruption in Californian society.<endOfText>
<human>Now this use of a formula, making the, the formula as pliable as possible to take in all these different themes, seems to me very interesting, because it seems to me a point at which popular literature, erm or the so-called easy dividing line between popular literature and high art, becomes very difficult to judge, very fuzzy.<endOfText>
<bot>I think generally in the erm classic detective story that is almost impossible to achieve.<endOfText>
<human>erm If you take a novel like Dorothy Sayers' Gaudy Night, which is offered as an example of a classic detective story which really is also a novel about academic life, it's a love story, I think as a love story and as a novel of academic life it's in many ways very good indeed, but I think as a detective story it's completely uninteresting  you know because one part has to fade in order that the, the other should come into focus.<endOfText>
<bot>And I think that the, just giving the example of Ross Macdonald, that this other kind of popular literature manages to avoid that.<endOfText>
<human>So basically you, you find them interesting because that you feel that they are connected in <endOfText>
<bot>Oh <endOfText>
<human>to society in a real sense and <endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes.<endOfText>
<human>reflect a lot that's going on in society.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes indeed.<endOfText>
<human>Well, thank you very much, John.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you.<endOfText>
<human>Governments may rise or fall, but it seems that the Civil Service goes on forever.<endOfText>
<bot>Are they faceless heartless bureaucrats, or are they overworked caring administrators?<endOfText>
<human>People's opinions vary, but one thing is clear: the Government is influenced by the views of the top civil servants, and in a very practical sense, it is the Civil Service that actually runs this country.<endOfText>
<bot>But is the situation different elsewhere?<endOfText>
<human>Anne Stevens is an expert on public administration, and specialises in French affairs.<endOfText>
<bot>I recently asked her whether the French civil service differed from their British counterparts.<endOfText>
<human>Many people think they are.<endOfText>
<bot>They have a very much more selective and elitist system at the top.<endOfText>
<human>They have a very fiercely competitive system, and some people say that you have to start preparing for this at nursery school erm and it's a question of going to the right schools, going to the right training colleges, though it's not so much a question of going to university, although you do have to have a university degree in most cases, but they have special training establishments with a tough competition to get into it, and as a result of this the people who come out are very highly selected, and think of themselves as being very professional, very competent, they have a great deal more self confidence, in some ways, than our British civil servants do.<endOfText>
<bot>And every so often erm the British look at this with a rather interested eye, and you'll find that erm Parliamentary committees erm there was one on the British Civil Service about two years, three years ago, nineteen seventy-seven, they went over to France to have a look at how the French did this to see if they could learn anything from the French experience, but in fact it's very difficult to transport somebody else's experience, lock, stock and barrel, into the British situation, and they quite sensibly concluded this wouldn't be a good idea.<endOfText>
<human>Is there the same relationship between ministers in the Government, in France, and their civil servants, as there is in Britain?<endOfText>
<bot>Do you have an amateur minister, as it were, backed up by a, a more professional administrative civil servant?<endOfText>
<human>In some senses you do, erm but there are important differences.<endOfText>
<bot>One of the important differences is that in France you get far more cases of ministers who have been civil servants in their previous existence.<endOfText>
<human>This is true of the present President, President Giscard, for example.<endOfText>
<bot>He went through the selection and training process that I am talking about.<endOfText>
<human>He was trained at the École Nationale d'Administration, which is the national administration training school, and in fact at the École Polytechnique as well, which is, so he was one of the few people who went through both the elite training establishments, and he served as a civil servant for a while before turning to political life and getting elected as a Member of Parliament.<endOfText>
<bot>And it's much more usual for that kind of thing to happen, so that you are more likely to get a, a minister who has a very good idea about how erm the civil service functions because he's been part of it.<endOfText>
<human>There are all sorts of reasons why this is true.<endOfText>
<bot>erm One of the reasons is that, unlike the British situation, you don't have to resign if you stand for election as a Member of Parliament in France.<endOfText>
<human>You can stand, and if you're not elected you simply go back to your old job.<endOfText>
<bot>Now this would be unthinkable in Britain, because we have a much stronger tradition of political neutrality for our civil servants.<endOfText>
<human>Our civil servants aren't supposed to display their political erm points of view.<endOfText>
<bot>In France there seems to be a separation.<endOfText>
<human>It's not felt that your private life in terms of your political opinions will necessarily impinge on your public life, and, and to deprive somebody of the right to express their opinions in public would be regarded as an infringement of his civil liberties, which would be unthinkable in a republican erm situation.<endOfText>
<bot>Is there a difference in the relationship between Parliament and the Government in France compared with Britain?<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes!<endOfText>
<bot>Quite a noticeable difference.<endOfText>
<human>It's a result of the Constitution of France, which was drawn up in nineteen fifty-eight, when General de Gaulle came to power, and the Constitution was very concerned to produce a separation between the legislative, that's the law-making, part of the government, and the executive, that's the part which was seen as carrying out the laws.<endOfText>
<bot>And so they made two provisions which make the situation rather different.<endOfText>
<human>One of them was to actually limit the amount of things that Parliament can pass laws about.<endOfText>
<bot>In Britain we have this very well-established doctrine that Parliament is sovereign.<endOfText>
<human>Parliament can do what it likes.<endOfText>
<bot>It, so the theory goes, it can repeal laws, it can pass laws, in any field.<endOfText>
<human>In France that isn't so.<endOfText>
<bot>There's an article of the Constitution which lays down the fields with which Parliament may concern itself.<endOfText>
<human>Obviously these are the most important fields, erm principles of taxation, for example, or the creation of new criminal offences.<endOfText>
<bot>Both of those require a parliamentary laws.<endOfText>
<human>But anything outside that is a matter for governmental regulation, and not for parliamentary laws.<endOfText>
<bot>So that's one big difference in the relationship between Parliament and Government.<endOfText>
<human>The other big difference is that ministers can't be Members of Parliament.<endOfText>
<bot>When you go to cast a vote in France, your ballot paper has two names on it, the name of the candidate for, or at least it has for each party or for each candidate two names.<endOfText>
<human>The name of the candidate who is standing for election, and the name of his replacement, who will replace him if he becomes ineligible to be a Member of Parliament.<endOfText>
<bot>And you vote for the pair of them.<endOfText>
<human>And if then your Member of Parliament is chosen to be a member of the Government, he resigns his seat in Parliament.<endOfText>
<bot>He has a month to decide whether he's going to stay as a Member of Parliament and not be a member of the Government, or whether he's going to be a member of the Government and resign his parliamentary seat.<endOfText>
<human>And if he decides to be a member of the Government he resigns his parliamentary seat and his replacement takes over without the need for a by-election.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you think the fact that the French erm constitution and the French administration is so different from the British administration, this leads to some of the erm occasional tangles and differences of views we have between the British and French?<endOfText>
<human>Oh, yes, I'm certain it does.<endOfText>
<bot>It isn't at all easy erm for people who have been accustomed to working in one system really to appreciate erm the nuances, the differences, the pressures on another system.<endOfText>
<human>And of course this can, can lead to misunderstandings, erm to difficulties, to different kinds of pressures.<endOfText>
<bot>One of the interesting things that I do is go every so often and talk to groups of British civil servants who are going to spend some of them a week some of them up to six weeks on an exchange visit erm with the French civil service, in an attempt to learn a certain amount erm about how the system works, both so that they will be able to understand more easily when it comes to joint erm ventures, joint matters, joint policies, what the other side is doing and the pressures within which it's operating, and also so that sometimes they may be able to learn things, and pick up useful tips and hints about the way to handle a particular problem.<endOfText>
<human>And it's always very interesting, I find, to go and talk to these groups of people erm and see the way that questions are put, which reflect a British experience, which are not the questions which a French civil servant would necessarily put, because his experience is different.<endOfText>
<bot>Are there any aspects of the French administration you think are, that are better than the British approach?<endOfText>
<human>I think one of the things which the French have learnt to do is, indeed, to integrate specialists, whether they're scientists, whether they're economists, erm and their generalists, that's to say the people who have basically a legal, economic, administrative background, to integrate them within the administrative hierarchy in a much better way than we have, erm and this is erm something which does I think make it easier sometimes to provide advice that really is erm clued up about the technical aspects of something.<endOfText>
<bot>Another, and that's a, it's a very much smaller point, but I think it's not unimportant thing, that I would like to see the British Civil Service emulating, is the amount of time and attention that the French give to training their young civil servants in foreign languages.<endOfText>
<human>It's very unusual to find a senior civil servant in France who can't speak either good English or good German or both, and it does make communications a lot easier.<endOfText>
<bot>I know that some British civil servants are making considerable efforts to improve erm in these terms but erm I think we've still got a long way to go in appreciating the importance of at least being able to understand somebody else's language, erm even if you can't always erm communicate in it as well as you can in your own.<endOfText>
<human>I certainly respond to what you were saying about having trained people in ministries.<endOfText>
<bot>I was talking to a civil servant in the Ministry of erm Energy the other day, and he said that he reckoned out of several hundred people working there there were about fifteen people who had a scientific or engineering background, and therefore were able to talk with some degree of expertise perhaps and certainly knowledge about the matters that they were discussing.<endOfText>
<human>The rest were, came from all sorts of different backgrounds.<endOfText>
<bot>The Civil Service in Britain has always this feeling that the problem with a specialist is that he may get too committed to his specialism.<endOfText>
<human>He may not be able to see the political and general interest wood for the specialist trees, and there is a sense in which there are obviously dangers of that kind erm and the generalist has always taken the view that it's for the specialist to be able to explain his problems in language which, after all, politicians who take the final decisions will have to be able to understand.<endOfText>
<bot>And there is some sense in this.<endOfText>
<human>I'm not sure it's a bad thing for a specialist to have to be able to explain his problems in terms which erm and intelligent and reasonably informed layman can understand, but erm I think perhaps in Britain we go too far erm in not integrating the two and putting them together and erm this is somewhere where the French in many cases have got the balance a bit better.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that's really as far as I would want to go.<endOfText>
<human>Anne, we have talked about France mainly, and I know that's your, your major interest erm but how do the other European countries compare with France, Germany, for example, perhaps the others?<endOfText>
<bot>Are they rather similar more similar to France in administration than Britain?<endOfText>
<human>In some respects they do have some characteristics that are similar to the French ones.<endOfText>
<bot>In Germany, for example, there's nothing like the division between Parliament and Government that I was speaking of erm as far as France was concerned, erm nor is there to quite the same extent erm the sort of links between administrative politicians and political administrators, but one of the things they share in common is a tendency to have a legal background and a legal approach to administration, and almost all senior civil servants in Germany, for example , have gone through a legal training.<endOfText>
<human>Admittedly legal training may be a bit wider, and may include elements of economics and political science, erm than the kind of training that we have in Britain, but it is nonetheless a law-dominated training, and this does make for a difference erm in approach, I think.<endOfText>
<bot>Germany, of course, is different because it has a federal system, so that the central administration is important in policy-making terms and policy is tending to go more and more towards the centre, but the administration of the different states, federal states, what they call the Länder, has a very important executive role, and the central government has a much less important role in actually carrying out policy.<endOfText>
<human>erm So it's rather smaller erm and in that sense differs, because of the extent to which the federal states have their, have their own powers and their own responsibilities.<endOfText>
<bot>So, in summary, we are all administered rather differently, but perhaps we've all got something to learn from each other.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, because we're all facing very much the same kind of problems.<endOfText>
<bot>Germany, admittedly, hasn't got quite the same high rate of inflation, but France has an inflation problem, France has an unemployment problem.<endOfText>
<human>erm Many of the problems of what are usually called ‘advanced capitalist industrial economies’ are similar, erm and I think it is increasingly the case that we find that we can't tackle them on our own, we need to consult, we need to learn from each other.<endOfText>
<bot>erm Other people's solutions affect what we can do, and so we have to come closer, in the sense at least of understanding and consulting.<endOfText>
<human>I'm sure that's very important.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you very much, Anne.<endOfText>
<human>That's all that we have time for today.<endOfText>
<bot>During the next few programmes, we're going to take a look at trends in science and engineering, particularly in the way that the subjects are taught, and opportunities for employment.<endOfText>
<human>Next week, for example, we shall start with mathematics.<endOfText>
<bot>How has maths teaching been influenced by the introduction of calculators and computers?<endOfText>
<human>Do we have enough old-fashioned arithmetic?<endOfText>
<bot>And how important is a good mathematical background to getting a job?<endOfText>
<human>These and other questions will be answered by Dudley Ward.<endOfText>
<bot>Until the same time next week, then, good-bye.<endOfText>
<human>Ted Young is a very familiar voice to Radio Brighton listeners because for many many years he has been presenting the weather forecast.<endOfText>
<bot>He's now taken a step upwards or sideways or whatever it is, he's gone to the Met Office Headquarters, and he's more concerned with other matters.<endOfText>
<human>Ted, what's it like to be a weather forecaster, are you a popular man as such?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, not all the time.<endOfText>
<human>No, not by any means, but of course, when the weather is right, people just accept it and take it for granted.<endOfText>
<bot>When it is wrong for their particular purposes then we get the blame for it.<endOfText>
<human>And are you confident when you give a weather forecast that the chances are that it's going to be correct, or do you do it with a slight feeling of uneasiness?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, there are always possible alternative forecasts that we might make, but on the whole I think we know that we have to decide the best possible forecast that we can give, and, well, when I say ‘the best’, the most erm confident forecast that we can push out erm with the information that we have available.<endOfText>
<human>Because if we don't do it that way, then our forecasts are of no use to anybody.<endOfText>
<bot>We could easily quite often sit on the fence and say the sun may come out or it may stay cloudy all day.<endOfText>
<human>The rain may reach the area but on the other hand it may not.<endOfText>
<bot>It's much better, I feel, from the public's point of view, for us simply to say ‘Yes, I think although it will be cloudy until the latter end of the morning that we confidently expect the sun to break through, and then when it's through it'll stay with us through the afternoon.<endOfText>
<human>It may produce the odd shower later in the afternoon with the heating but erm a fair part of the day will be dry.’<endOfText>
<bot>Most people just listen to weather forecasts and either believe them or don't believe them and certainly get cross with people like yourselves if it <endOfText>
<human>mhm<endOfText>
<bot>doesn't work out the right way,but that must be just the tip of the iceberg as far as you're concerned.<endOfText>
<human>The real work I suspect is behind the scenes in all sorts of different ways.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>What do you have to do actually to, to prepare a forecast?<endOfText>
<bot>What actually happens?<endOfText>
<human>Well of course we are, the forecast that you hear on the radio or watch on the television is erm just the front end of a very last organisation.<endOfText>
<bot>First of all the British Met Office erm receives information from all over the world, and it is able to do this because it is part of a massive weather organisation called the World Met Organisation, and this is linked by very, very high-speed communications worldwide.<endOfText>
<human>We have now erm at least the World Met Organisation has established a world global trunk communication system, and this can transmit information and it does transmit information to right round the world at very, very high speed.<endOfText>
<bot>If I can give you an example of what I'm talking about, part of the information we receive of course is erm surface, weather reports taken by weather observers at all sorts of places across the face of the earth.<endOfText>
<human>Every hour of the day some eight thousand five hundred of these reports are made.<endOfText>
<bot>They are fed in onto this global trunk circuit erm from many feeder lines, sometimes by radio, sometimes by telephone, but they get in onto the very high-speed trunk circuit, and of those eight and half thousand observations made every hour, it takes between four and five minutes for six and half thousand of them to reach us at Bracknell.<endOfText>
<human>And if that's not fast communication, I don't know what is.<endOfText>
<bot>The remaining two and a half thousand, because they come in on very much slower methods, can take up to two to three hours to reach Bracknell, but by the end of the three hours we have all the information that was available at any given hour of the day.<endOfText>
<human>Forecasting has obviously improved a great deal over the years.<endOfText>
<bot>Is this largely due to being able to get many more measurements at many different places and stick them together rather rapidly using a computer?<endOfText>
<human>Well of course to forecast the weather accurately, you have to understand the atmosphere.<endOfText>
<bot>In past years erm in the British Isles especially with the British Met Office, we've only been able really to study part of the atmosphere over the northern hemisphere.<endOfText>
<human>First of all it was just covering the North Atlantic, the eastern seaboard of the States, perhaps Greenland and Iceland, and Europe down as far as North Africa, and erm we concentrated on that part of the atmosphere, but of course the atmosphere is continuous all round the globe, and whatever happens in any part of that atmosphere, any part of the globe, has some affect on the rest of the atmosphere.<endOfText>
<bot>And so nowadays, with the advent of high-speed telecommunications, satellites, and the formation of the World Met Organisation in particular, we now get the information that I've already mentioned all over the world, very high-speed arrangements, and so we can now study the atmosphere all the way across.<endOfText>
<human>The satellite erm in particular has helped considerably in this area, and future satellites we think will benefit even more, because we shall be taking erm infra-red erm pictures, as we fondly call them, of the atmosphere from that very high level, and sampling the atmosphere at very, very detailed levels, about one hundred metre-steps from the surface right up to anything up to ten thousand kilometres.<endOfText>
<bot>What sort of measurements do you do?<endOfText>
<human>Is it air pressure and, and humidity and so on?<endOfText>
<bot>Well the surface weather observer will take temperature, pressure, humidity, erm the wind speed and direction, he will study visibility, he will see whether it's raining or there are showers in his vicinity, erm study the amount of cloud, the type of cloud above him as he can see it, erm all these details will feed in onto a routine hourly observation.<endOfText>
<human>Other times of the day of course he measures minimum temperature, maximum temperature, erm and the number of sunshine hours, the rainfall, and other temperatures such as ground temperatures or the earth's temperatures, all these things come into the picture to build up a weather observation.<endOfText>
<bot>At sea of course they measure the temperature of the surface of the sea as well.<endOfText>
<human>erm To what extent do you rely on measurements, as it were, and to what erm extent do you rely on actual observations, because it seems to me that there's a, at least a possibility that you may have a whole sort of set of measurements that may indicate something's going to happen, but if you actually stuck your head out of the window and looked up you could see it was actually raining instead of sunny?<endOfText>
<bot>Well of course bear in mind that when these observations are made, as they are at present, erm at spots over the atmosphere, they're represent the weather as seen from that spot.<endOfText>
<human>Some of them are taken by instrumentation but others are eye observations.<endOfText>
<bot>Now they can only represent the area that the observer stands in and can see around him, and erm this leaves many gaps over the surface of the earth where we cannot really be sure of what the weather's doing.<endOfText>
<human>We have to assume it's the same as the nearest observation, so erm it can be misleading just to take the surface observation, surface instrumentation readings, erm but erm we have to be able to interpolate, and this is the experience of the forecaster comes in, to say what is in the gaps.<endOfText>
<bot>And sometimes he's wrong, of course.<endOfText>
<human>There can be, as erm I saw demonstrated recently, very large thunderstorm occurring in between observations, and that thunderstorm cannot be seen by any one of the surface observations, but it is there, radar can pick it up, for instance, or a satellite can see it, but the man on the ground can't see it necessarily, and so that could slip through and it may be the only thunderstorm in a vast area, but it is there, but the observations don't show it.<endOfText>
<bot>The general public are only really aware of some of your services, I suspect.<endOfText>
<human>They hear weather forecasts, erm see weather forecasts presented on television, and perhaps read weather forecasts in the newspaper, but the Met Office does very much more than that, doesn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, it does indeed, yes.<endOfText>
<human>In fact we are really divided into various branches.<endOfText>
<bot>We have a, a whole range of branches doing research into the atmosphere.<endOfText>
<human>There's a tremendous amount we don't know about the atmosphere.<endOfText>
<bot>We're always finding out new evidence.<endOfText>
<human>erm We have to study the atmosphere at very levels, say, from the ground, up to six inches above the ground.<endOfText>
<bot>If you stop and think about it's very important that, that area of atmosphere for growing crops, seedlings, and things of this nature, so there is an agricultural erm connection there.<endOfText>
<human>Then there is the general atmosphere from the ground up to, say, a hundred thousand feet.<endOfText>
<bot>erm In this area, all our ‘weather’ as we call it, rain, cloud, and wind, mostly occur, so we have to study this for the general forecast point of view.<endOfText>
<human>Then there are erm the outer space of areas, the very high atmosphere, not outer space really, but the high atmosphere areas, we don't know a lot about this.<endOfText>
<bot>The ozone layers and erm the advent of carbon dioxide and these sorts of things, we're studying this all the time to see how it affects the atmosphere, how it therefore affects our weather.<endOfText>
<human>So we have research branches looking into that.<endOfText>
<bot>Then there are other things, there are the ocean currents.<endOfText>
<human>There's the El Niño Current, which has been in the news through the summer, off the coast of South America.<endOfText>
<bot>This is erm a warm current, small current, but nearby there is a big excursion of warm water wells up, and we're not very sure why, but it extends out into the Pacific.<endOfText>
<human>This year it's extended far further than usual, and you've got hundreds of thousands of square miles of water which is much warmer than usual in the Pacific.<endOfText>
<bot>Now this will affect a vast area of atmosphere, because the air moving over that sea surface tends to take up the characteristics and if the temperature's higher on the sea surface than normal, the air becomes warmer than normal, and this sets up all sorts of reactions, it will probably produce a lot more clouds, for instance, and erm this in turn will cut off the sun's rays from that area of atmosphere, and this will have an effect on the whole erm heat engine of the atmosphere as we know it so erm we're now studying how far afield this is affecting the weather.<endOfText>
<human>Is it affecting the weather all round the world?<endOfText>
<bot>Is it, can we attribute this sort of thing to the erm areas of drought, the areas of flooding that are occurring in various parts of the world at the moment, and all these sorts of things, and we have branches looking into this.<endOfText>
<human>Then we come onto the, the real sort of erm bread-and-butter forecasting world, and erm as you rightly say, most people are, think that we just do the radio and television forecasting, erm perhaps read the newspapers and see the forecasts there, but there's much more to it than that.<endOfText>
<bot>For daily operation and domestic use, of course, the Electricity and Gas Authorities, they have to predict the amount of gas or electricity required, and the first thing they have to think about is what is the weather expected?<endOfText>
<human>So we are erm continuously forecasting for the Gas and Electricity Authorities.<endOfText>
<bot>The Water Authority, well, there again, they're interested to some extent in forecast rainfall, but they're more interested in erm how much rain has fallen over quite a big area and erm over what a, what sort of period, so we maintain all the rainfall statistics throughout the country.<endOfText>
<human>Some eight thousand or eight and half thousand erm rain gauges are involved, we get all the information from these being fed into us all the time.<endOfText>
<bot>Then erm one could go on, because the building industry, for instance, civil engineering, road construction, actual buildings being constructed, they're all very weather-prone, for quite a large extent of the contract, and so we provide erm weather advice to these people throughout the contract period usually, and not only throughout the contract period, but if the contract is held up because of weather then the, we get extension of contract comes into this, we can advise both sides on whether the claim is justified or not, because we have the statistics of how much rain fell, how cold it was, or perhaps it might have been a windy spell.<endOfText>
<human>All these sort of things we, we keep tabs on.<endOfText>
<bot>And I suppose people organising special events must erm seek your advice on occasions.<endOfText>
<human>That's right, there are the leisure sides of things, the sailing industries, the golfing, erm many, many calls we get from the man who wants to play his round of golf tomorrow morning or in the afternoon or something of this sort.<endOfText>
<bot>He will ring up and enquire.<endOfText>
<human>Of course I must add a, a word of warning here, because whereas once upon a time many people used to be able to ring the Weather Centres or a Met Office to get their own personal forecast, which was very nice, we enjoyed doing this, it has now got to the stage where so many people are trying to ring us that we just cannot deal with all the enquiries personally, and we're looking into ways and means of erm providing forecasts of this sort of nature, they're general sort of nature, by other means, such as radio and television.<endOfText>
<bot>We're always anxious to push out more forecasts if we can on these erm services but erm the Government are also leaning on us and saying, ‘Yes, but you're spending lots of money on satellites, computers and all this sort  erm You must get some of that money back.’<endOfText>
<human>So now we're having to charge for more of our services.<endOfText>
<bot>I personally don't like doing it, because it involves accountancy and all this sort of thing, but erm it erm when you stop and think about it, it's a, it's a must.<endOfText>
<human>Somebody's got to pay for everything.<endOfText>
<bot>You can't get anything for free in this world.<endOfText>
<human>What, what about events at shows, erm air shows and pigeon racing erm <endOfText>
<bot>Yes, we're involved in all these.<endOfText>
<human>erm The, the shows themselves, air shows, or even fêtes and things like this, the organisers are always very interested in the weather.<endOfText>
<bot>They like us to come along and have a stand erm which we do sometimes, and erm it also follows on, the insurance companies then step in because very often the organisers will take out a pluvious insurance to erm fend themselves off against loss of income because of wet weather, and we provide the information to the insurance companies of how much rain fell in the vicinity of that show, and this sort of thing.<endOfText>
<human>As regards pigeon racing, well, many people don't realise how much money is invested in pigeon racing.<endOfText>
<bot>I was at one point some years ago told that more money's invested in pigeon racing than in horse racing.<endOfText>
<human>I found this difficult to believe, but erm judging by the number of pigeon forecasts, race forecasts that we issue, erm we're very often talking about a quarter of a million pigeons at a time flying from A to B, and we provide the forecasts for these federations that race these pigeons, and there are a lot of pigeons flying about.<endOfText>
<bot>I know I see a lot of pigeons in my garden, but erm racing pigeons, erm it's a very, very big industry.<endOfText>
<human>And the Brighton area.<endOfText>
<bot>Does that have good weather, compared with the rest of the country?<endOfText>
<human>Well of course it must do, it's on the south coast for, first of all, but erm the South Downs have their problems.<endOfText>
<bot>They're beautiful if you're walking across the Downs and admiring the trees or the open countryside, but erm there are times, and we've had just a recent spell with easterly winds, and we find with an easterly wind along the south coast, because of the Downs, and because of the, the Dover Straits, these easterly winds tend to erm funnel, as we call it, and therefore they are stronger than they would normally be expected to be, so Brighton does have its disadvantages in, from that point of view, but from the sunshine and the general point of view erm it takes a lot to beat the area.<endOfText>
<human>Ted Young, thank you very much.<endOfText>
<bot>My pleasure.<endOfText>
<human>for almost any day, and you'll find news of floods, famines, earthquakes, and any number of other natural and man-created disasters.<endOfText>
<bot>This is the first of a short series of programmes in which we shall be taking a look at some of these unfortunate happenings, and asking questions such as, ‘To what extent can they predicted?’ and ‘How can they best be coped with?’<endOfText>
<human>Dr. Francis de Souza, the founder and Director of the International Disaster Institute based in London, recently visited the University.<endOfText>
<bot>I asked her how one defined a disaster.<endOfText>
<human>Well it's a very good question.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that the simple answer that it's you, the media, who decide whether an event is a disaster by the way in which you report it.<endOfText>
<human>If an earthquake happens in, let us say, Timbuctoo, and it is a very strong earthquake which shakes erm towns in surrounding areas perhaps sort of fifty miles away erm that is clearly a disaster of one sort or another.<endOfText>
<bot>But if it doesn't kill lots of people, we don't consider it a disaster, or if you, the media, decide not to report it, it isn't a disaster.<endOfText>
<human>Disaster is something which comes on your telly, mid-evening, and shows pictures of people in distress, usually people from the other end of, of the world, that's a disaster.<endOfText>
<bot>And presumably there's also a time-scale associated to a disaster.<endOfText>
<human>A disaster can't by definition last too long.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>I think that's an extremely good point actually, because of course, when one thinks about it and looks at it, there are many many things which are happening in today's world which are disasters.<endOfText>
<bot>The way in which forests are disappearing, land is becoming desert, erm food is not being grown in areas where it used to be grown, those are disasters, but what we're talking about is the, the rather more sudden event which, which you know reaches a crescendo, even if it does take a long time to develop, like a famine, nevertheless the disaster is considered to be that point when perhaps thousands of people are in very desperate need of food.<endOfText>
<human>Is there an element in which a disaster is an event which you can't forecast?<endOfText>
<bot>Is there a sense in which if you knew it was coming it's not a disaster, or at least it, it needn't be a disaster?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean that is really, in a sense, what we're all about at the International Disaster Institute, is to try and carefully work out what happens to people in various parts of the world.<endOfText>
<human>If there's a drought, how that drought affects people so that they actually begin to starve from want of food.<endOfText>
<bot>Now if we are able to work out what happens, then of course we can relay that information to the major relief agencies, whom we would hope could then step in and provide food before the famine occurs.<endOfText>
<human>Unfortunately we've not got to that stage yet, and it's very rare for a threatened famine to be prevented by the international relief community, and even, once it has occurred, it's very rare for the relief to run smoothly, so I think the research part is to try and find out how to get the right aid to the right people at the right time.<endOfText>
<bot>Is, is disaster research linked to some extent to risk-taking theory?<endOfText>
<human>Is that very much to do with your sort of research you do?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, very much so, because I mean there are two aspects to a disaster.<endOfText>
<human>First of all it's the, the finding out erm how best you can prevent one, and then when you've found that out trying to persuade people to take the necessary measures to make themselves less vulnerable.<endOfText>
<bot>erm For instance we know that, that erm in this country you can't get a mortgage without taking out fire insurance, and the reason why it's mandatory in a mortgage is because if it were left to people's whim they wouldn't do it, they'd say, ‘Well it won't happen to me,’ and mortgage companies don't like that very much.<endOfText>
<human>But I think that what we're dealing with in developing countries is not so much erm an unwillingness to make themselves less vulnerable to disasters but much more erm they don't have the resources.<endOfText>
<bot>They don't have the money.<endOfText>
<human>And if you have a very small amount of money, and a large number of erm demands on, on that budget, then the last thing you're going to do, is to spend a lot of money reinforcing your house for an earthquake that may affect your grandchildren and not you.<endOfText>
<bot>So I think that disaster preparedness and, and, and making yourself safer comes only when you have quite a large surplus, and that means in the developed countries of the world, like the Californian was much, much less likely to die from an earthquake even though he lives in a very vulnerable part of the world, than perhaps erm a rural person in Central America.<endOfText>
<human>To what extent do you research into specific disasters, floods, for example, or earthquakes?<endOfText>
<bot>We at the Institute research into those disasters erm for which we currently have an expertise, as it were, but erm our group was founded actually at the beginning of erm the nineteen seventies and we have specialised quite a lot into looking at famine food erm emergencies and nutritional and medical engineering, sanitation aspects of famines, and lately we've included in that erm quite of lot of, of work, research work into refugees, the cause of refugees, the prevention of refugees, the alleviation of suffering of refugees, particularly in developing countries.<endOfText>
<human>Floods is a fairly highly specialised now, particularly flood plain management.<endOfText>
<bot>On the whole we've tended to leave that to, to people who do have that specialisation.<endOfText>
<human>Do you carry out your research by studying actual disasters as they take place or do you build models, theories as to what might take place?<endOfText>
<bot>Well we do both.<endOfText>
<human>I think that the idea of erm you know, rushing in to a disaster, taking the aeroplane out, and, and seeing this enormous distress around one and sitting there with a notebook and a pencil is, is unacceptable and indeed we don't do that at all.<endOfText>
<bot>What we tend to do is to brief ourselves very thoroughly on vulnerable spots in the world, and in countries where we already have links and where we've worked before and we know the background because we, we feel we need that and we monitor very carefully certain events which could lead to a disaster, so that when the disaster does happen, like for instance the Ugandan famine of nineteen seventy-nine to eighty-one, we knew exactly when it was going to happen and we knew exactly where the people were, we knew who was going to be affected, we knew why they were affected, we knew where the food stocks were, we knew how long it was going to take to get so many thousand tonnes of food from A to B erm and how many trucks you would need.<endOfText>
<human>I mean it was down to that kind of detail.<endOfText>
<bot>So when we actually got out there, we go out to work in some capacity or another, either to carry out a survey of the logistics or perhaps to sort out and look at the way in which one can set up an immunisation programme in a refugee camp.<endOfText>
<human>It's always in a working capacity, but the difference being that we note down the results of our work, document it very carefully so that we can provide some kind of a lesson learnt for a future operation.<endOfText>
<bot>Do people listen to you?<endOfText>
<human>Not enough.<endOfText>
<bot>Not enough.<endOfText>
<human>And I think there are two reasons for that.<endOfText>
<bot>First of all because erm when we set ourselves up we were erm I think fairly critical of the relief system, and the relief system erm I think is still very bruised from that, it didn't like being criticised.<endOfText>
<human>And I find that extremely understandable, but nevertheless we felt it was necessary to say, ‘Well, you know, it's not right.<endOfText>
<bot>They're not getting it right, and there are really no longer any excuses.’<endOfText>
<human>The second reason is that there are huge constraints to effective relief programmes.<endOfText>
<bot>They are political constraints, particularly with the U N, they are political ones when one considers government to government aid, I mean at the moment for instance the British Administration will only give large, significant amounts of emergency relief to countries which are already recipients of British development aid.<endOfText>
<human>The third factor which I think tends to constrain rapid and effective relief action is that erm disasters are fundraising opportunities for agencies.<endOfText>
<bot>Public attention is focussed on an event somewhere in a remote part of the world, and people are extremely generous.<endOfText>
<human>And in a way this interferes with acting in advance of the disaster, or indeed acting perhaps not immediately, but spending a little time considering what might be the priority needs and then going in with it.<endOfText>
<bot>There's tremendous pressure on agencies to, you know, to send in the medicines, to send in the blankets, when they may not really be needed.<endOfText>
<human>So I think that the kind of logical erm thread and erm that we present and the logical work that we do is not always compatible with the actions of the international humanitarian community, but it is changing, slowly.<endOfText>
<bot>What do you feel about the contributions of the voluntary agents like Oxfam or Christian Aid in terms of disasters?<endOfText>
<human>I would thought that from my quite long experience now with the relief agencies that the British operational agencies, that is those agencies which consistently respond to overseas disasters and send out their own people, technically and professionally qualified people, and that would be really Save the Children Fund and Oxfam, are absolutely excellent.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean they probably are the best in the world.<endOfText>
<human>They're not exactly specialist agencies but they have a great deal of experience and they have a commitment to a certain kind of research, and they have, I mean we've had our run-ins with them as it were, but they have listened, and they've supported some of our work as well , and I think that they in time will provide a kind of model as it were for a number of erm perhaps less experienced agencies throughout the world, newly set-up ones, as to how it is possible to do consistently good logical rational work in the face of the chaos that a disaster produces.<endOfText>
<bot>What about disasters in this country?<endOfText>
<human>Are there any disasters you see in your books that might take place in this country that we're not taking any notice of, in terms of planning at all?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I think there are a very large number.<endOfText>
<human>I mean we, we were very concerned about the possibility of there being wide-scale, widespread large-scale flooding of London before the barrier was put up.<endOfText>
<bot>In fact we were funded by an independent erm foundation to do a, a very large study of that which we did and we reported and we, we found that the risk was totally unacceptable, calculating statistically the risk.<endOfText>
<human>erm There are many areas of the British Isles which are, are liable to flooding and vulnerable to floods.<endOfText>
<bot>I think another erm area is this question of erm you know dumping of toxic waste, and transporting of toxic waste, which after all could flare up into a disaster very rapidly indeed.<endOfText>
<human>And apparently a colleague of mine gave a paper this morning saying that Kent was vulnerable to earthquakes erm even though earthquakes have not been recorded or at least not substantial ones in this country for perhaps two, three hundred years erm there is a history of earthquakes in, particularly in the sort of Colchester, Essex, Kent region, and erm the erm the historians and the pundits tell us that erm they may come back again so perhaps we ought to reinforce our buildings now.<endOfText>
<bot>What about on a personal level?<endOfText>
<human>Do you ever think about a disasters as erm an individual level or do you just deal with them at a large-scale, national group level?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>I mean disasters to us, necessarily, means a lot of people being involved in a short space of time in a limited geographical area.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean it's the old story, isn't it, one person who gets killed on a Bank Holiday car crash is not news but four getting killed together is a disaster, is newsworthy, I mean that's the way it works.<endOfText>
<human>Are you concerned about our roads and railway systems?<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>We leave that to the specialists, and indeed I think that the reason why we're particularly concerned with disasters which happen in the poorer parts of the world, the developing countries, is because they seem to have less of a voice to be able to complain about what is done to them.<endOfText>
<bot>There are assumptions made in the richer, Western countries, the donor nations, about what people need, and they're saddled with it, and it can have long-term, disastrous effects, the wrong kind of aid.<endOfText>
<human>And I think that our concern is to try and see how that can be improved and, and possibly the underlying reason for that is that erm we all feel that unless we take it seriously, the kind of disasters that increasingly affect developing countries, and try to make our own assistance more rational, more respectful in a way of, of them and their cultures, then I think we're storing up an enormous amount of trouble for ourselves in the future.<endOfText>
<bot>Whereas I think in this country that there are adequate channels and mechanisms for people to protest, or, you know, for others to protest on their behalf.<endOfText>
<human>It would clearly be very difficult to compare one disaster to another, in fact I'm not even sure you could do it from a grammatical point of view, but if you were to point your finger somewhere in the world and say, ‘We really ought to look at what's happening here, or what might happen there,’ could you think of one outstanding example?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, I'm afraid I can, very immediately and very clearly indeed, and that is famine.<endOfText>
<human>We, we felt at the end of the seventies that there was no question that the eighties was going to be a decade of increasing food shortages, and widespread famine, that is, people literally dying for want of food.<endOfText>
<bot>And sadly, very sadly I think we're being proved right.<endOfText>
<human>Francis, thank you very much.<endOfText>
<bot>Continuing our short series on education, today we're going to talk about the school curriculum.<endOfText>
<human>A few weeks ago the Secretary of State, Sir Keith Joseph, announced that he would like schools and the educational world generally, to explore whether they could define specific objectives for particular subjects.<endOfText>
<bot>Putting it crudely, a core of knowledge, such that if a student knew certain facts, he could be said to have reached a certain standard.<endOfText>
<human>In this way perhaps examination assessment could be made more objective.<endOfText>
<bot>In recent months, Sir Keith has set up a national committee to explore some of these possibilities.<endOfText>
<human>The School Curriculum Development Committee, as it's called, is headed by Professor Roger Blin-Stoyle, who is a physicist at Sussex.<endOfText>
<bot>Roger, has your Committee started work yet?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, erm we began work in earnest in the beginning of the New Year.<endOfText>
<bot>I should perhaps explain, though, how the Committee came into being.<endOfText>
<human>erm Listeners will probably know that there has been for many years what's called the Schools Council, which has looked at erm curriculum matters and examination matters, and a year or so ago it was decided to discontinue the Schools Council, and to replace it by two successor committees, one the School Curriculum Development Committee, which you've already mentioned and which I chair, and a parallel committee concerned with examinations, the School Examination, sorry the Secondary Examination Council, which is chaired by a mathematician, Sir Wilfred Cockroft.<endOfText>
<bot>The Examination Council came into being some erm nine months ago and has already been involved in quite a lot of activity, I mean particularly the erm problem of sixteen-plus examining, whether we should move from a system of erm O-levels and C S E, or to a combined system, Sixteen-plus Examination it would probably be called.<endOfText>
<human>Well we may return to that in a moment <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>but I want to ask you, are you going to work on this idea of a core curriculum?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, this is certainly one of the things that we shall be looking at.<endOfText>
<human>erm You must recognise that the general outline of school education, from primary and in secondary level, is a matter of policy, and this is in the hands of the D E S and local authorities.<endOfText>
<bot>Our role, I think, has to be, among a great many other things, to look at the over-all effect of the school curriculum, to ensure that it's balanced, that it's cohesive, and that it has an appropriate spread for all children.<endOfText>
<human>At this particular point in time, we have the Technical Vocational Education Initiative.<endOfText>
<bot>This is an initiative which is enabling schools to pay quite a lot of attention to vocational matters.<endOfText>
<human>And that is something that we shall want to look at to see what impact this has on the rest of the curriculum.<endOfText>
<bot>So yes, the answer to your question is, we shall be looking at the curriculum as a whole, and at its various parts.<endOfText>
<human>And when you say various parts, do you mean various ages and stages as well, or is this essentially something for sixteen-year-olds?<endOfText>
<bot>No, we mean all ages and all stages.<endOfText>
<human>Our task is to consider the situation from the earliest primary level through till, certainly the compulsory school-leaving erm age, sixteen, but of course we shall be very interested in developments between sixteen and eighteen.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you actually going to include subjects that are less traditional, perhaps, erm compared with the academic subjects such as history and geography?<endOfText>
<human>Are you looking at personal and social education, if I could call it that?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, this is certainly one thing that erm we want to look at.<endOfText>
<human>We're moving into erm an age where, for example, there is a lot of unemployment, and one can't see that going away very quickly.<endOfText>
<bot>It's an age when I think erm children leaving school have got to be versatile, self-reliant and able to cope with very changing situation.<endOfText>
<human>We live in a technological age, and there are going to be major changes without a doubt, we've all seen them over the past few decades, and into the future there are going to be many major changes.<endOfText>
<bot>And so children have got to leave school able to cope with these changes, and this means that we have to develop self-reliance in them, and general abilities for living.<endOfText>
<human>So yes, we shall be looking at erm those sort of matters.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you concerned with equality of opportunity for both boys and girls, for example?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, that is something that erm we've erm made quite clear, as a result of our first major meeting, which we held two or three weeks ago, that sex equality, sex stereotyping, are matters that have got to be looked into very carefully.<endOfText>
<bot>This is particularly important, and I'm now riding my own hobby horse, but in the area of science erm we have a situation that erm in most secondary schools choice has to be made at the age of thirteen, fourteen, by boys and girls as to which subjects they should take.<endOfText>
<human>Most girls opt out of the physical sciences.<endOfText>
<bot>erm This has a knock-on effect insofar as if they've once given up the physical sciences, then it means that they've given up all hopes, when they leave school, of following a, a job or a profession, of courses in further or higher education, in technological, engineering subjects.<endOfText>
<human>And we are moving into an age, I think it must be recognised, where some of the traditional jobs for girls, for example, secretaries, shops, things of this sort, are actually being decreased because of the technological revolution, so bearing in mind that something like seventy per cent of women are actually in employment, it's very important that a girl, at the age of thirteen or fourteen, does not decide to cut herself off from the possibility of employment in these technological, engineering fields.<endOfText>
<bot>So one thing that I'm sure we'll want to do is to support the work of the Secondary Science Curriculum Review.<endOfText>
<human>This is one of the projects that we've inherited, incidentally run by another member of Sussex University, Dr. Dick West, which is recommending, and it's getting a lot of strong support for this, that all children should have a balanced science education, including the physical sciences, up to the age of sixteen, and so that erm issue of choice will just not arise.<endOfText>
<bot>It must be very difficult to be objective so far as the curriculum and level of knowledge of certain subjects are concerned.<endOfText>
<human>I would imagine that almost the easiest subject to start with is something like mathematics.<endOfText>
<bot>Am I right in thinking you can define more readily whether you know something or don't know something in mathematics?<endOfText>
<human>Well, yes, mathematics is a nice, tidy, logical subject, and erm is a subject which erm terrifies a lot of children, and I think here particularly of the situation in primary schools.<endOfText>
<bot>About erm eighteen months, two years ago a report was published, the Cockroft Report, this is the same Sir Wilfred Cockroft who's chairing the Examination erm Council, which looked into the teaching of mathematics at all level in the country and it was an extremely good report and a lot has followed from it.<endOfText>
<human>One thing that has not been taken up very thoroughly at this stage is the question of teaching of mathematics in primary schools, and this is a field that erm we decided at our last meeting that we must erm look into.<endOfText>
<bot>So many children can be put off mathematics at the primary level, and it's important this doesn't happen.<endOfText>
<human>It's also important that erm children at primary level do learn something of calculators and the technology of mathematics.<endOfText>
<bot>They see them at home, it's all around them, but the use of calculators for example has not really been built yet widely into the curriculum for primary schools, so that is an area that we shall be having a look at.<endOfText>
<human>And you're not worried that the use of calculators at too early a stage would make a child quite incapable of understanding what addition and multiplication  and so forth is  <endOfText>
<bot>Well of course there, there is this worry, and, and they have to be used erm properly and in a helpful way.<endOfText>
<human>I think erm certainly for a child to rely entirely on a calculator for all mathematical operations would be a disastrous thing.<endOfText>
<bot>On the other hand, used aright, it can help very much in the understanding of mathematical operations, because far more many and widespread examples can be dealt with very quickly, and they can for example erm get a feel of the result of multiplying or dividing or whatever it, it is, numbers of quite different sizes.<endOfText>
<human>So I think there is a lot of work to be done there, but as you rightly say, it has to be done carefully and one mustn't get the dependency on calculators which one does see around one.<endOfText>
<bot>I've seen this in shops when somebody has to add a twenty p to seventy-three p and out comes the calculator <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>and this is terrible.<endOfText>
<human>What about the skills which are very important but don't come as a formal part of any subject, the so-called communication skills?<endOfText>
<bot>Are you thinking about those at all?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>I, I'm sorry to keep saying ‘Yes’ to everything  that you're, you're suggesting, but yes, we are thinking about communication skills, particularly the encouraging and helping children to learn to write properly, I don't mean calligraphy, I mean actually write and express themselves on paper, oral communication, and things of this kind are things that we do want to pay attention to.<endOfText>
<human>I should perhaps explain in the context of your various questions when I say that erm we do want to become involved in these things, that, at this stage, and we've only held two meetings, we have just identified themes and general areas in which we want to work, and not precise projects or activities.<endOfText>
<bot>That will be the next stage we shall be working on over the next half-year or so, and what we do want to do is to seek the help of all the local authorities and teachers in this work, because one should perhaps put things into context, we're a committee of twenty-two people, we have a staff, which when they're all fully employed they'll be about fifty, we have a budget of two million, but we have got to communicate with something like four hundred to five hundred thousand teachers, something like erm five thousand secondary schools and twenty-six thousand primary schools.<endOfText>
<human>So it is a major problem, this communication, and so we do have to work with local authorities, with teacher organisations, anyone who can help us in this task.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you going to set up lots of projects?<endOfText>
<human>Well, we shall certainly be setting up some projects, but we would hope to use small-scale projects which are perhaps already underway in different local authorities.<endOfText>
<bot>And we have also inherited a number of projects from the Schools Council.<endOfText>
<human>I've mentioned already the Secondary Science Curriculum Review.<endOfText>
<bot>erm I won't list them all, but there are one or two interesting ones, for example, there is a project dealing with the relation between education and industry, the Schools Council Industry Project, which we wish to support.<endOfText>
<human>This is a project which is to help children at school understand something of industry and of the industrial world in which they're going to work, and also conversely to bring industrialists into involvement with schools themselves and with developing the curriculum.<endOfText>
<bot>Lastly, Roger, your committee, it's a small committee, twenty-two members <endOfText>
<human>mhm<endOfText>
<bot>tackling an immense task.<endOfText>
<human>Are you open to suggestions from the educational field as a whole as to what you should do and what's important and so on?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, indeed.<endOfText>
<human>I said earlier that we want to involve all aspects of the educational system, and for example we have already written to every local authority in the country, telling them about the general themes that we have identified as important, asking for their comments, for their suggestions of other matters that we should perhaps look into, and also asking for their help and involvement.<endOfText>
<bot>So yes, we're very much open to suggestion.<endOfText>
<human>erm We shall have our own ideas, of course, and these are expressed at this stage in terms of these general themes, but we surely will respond when, if there are any suggestions coming.<endOfText>
<bot>Roger, thank you very much, and good luck in this enormous project you're undertaking.<endOfText>
<human>That's all that we have time for today.<endOfText>
<bot>Next Sunday we shall be looking at another live education issue.<endOfText>
<human>Until next week then, good-bye.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah whatever.<endOfText>
<human>Ow!<endOfText>
<bot>Oh I've got, I've gotta really clean out my pockets I've got so much crap.<endOfText>

<human>what a crisp like tastes like.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Why's the old lady talking to the people?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh no when do you wanna go and<endOfText>
<human>Where's Sam?<endOfText>
<bot>Ha?<endOfText>
<human>Where's Sam do you know?<endOfText>
<bot>Where's Sam?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Don't think he's in today, no.<endOfText>
<human>No he is, I've seen him.<endOfText>
<bot>Well he wasn't in media studies.<endOfText>
<human>Oh he's started bunking off now, Sam you know.<endOfText>
<bot>Has he?<endOfText>
<human>I don't give a shit.<endOfText>
<bot>He's a right little shit.<endOfText>
<human>Don't you think right Dan's boxing day thing was really really really shit?<endOfText>
<bot>It was actually wasn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>good right and I  <endOfText>
<human>got them from Honey?<endOfText>
<bot>I know.<endOfText>
<human>I know.<endOfText>
<bot>Now  oh shit which <endOfText>
<human>What you listening to Cass?<endOfText>
<bot>I'm not listening to anything I'm just trying to sort the bloody thing out.<endOfText>
<human>What's in the tape?<endOfText>
<bot>What's on the tape?<endOfText>
<human>Absolutely fuck all it's recording.<endOfText>
<bot>Someone tell him about it I'm fucking getting fed up with telling every single person <endOfText>
<human>A Norwegian university has asked for five people<endOfText>
<bot>Six people.<endOfText>
<human>er six people from our school to tape conversations <endOfText>
<bot>What, any conversation at all?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Just leave it on basically for about an hour as long as you're having a conversation<endOfText>
<human>Oh no, do you mean we're all going <endOfText>
<bot>and like it <endOfText>
<human>around saying hello!<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah it doesn't matter, it does er it doesn't matter er it's studying<endOfText>
<human>Well we can like endlessly swear on it <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Oh don't, don't tell him cos he's gonna bloody go fuck fuck fuck on it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah you can't, I mean you can't sit there being an immature little <endOfText>
<human>Fuck fuck fuck <endOfText>
<bot>cripple and say yeah I'm fucking bollocksed wanks  ten grammes of smack please.<endOfText>
<human>Why?<endOfText>
<bot>You do it all the time.<endOfText>
<human>Doesn't she?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah I know but I don't do it purposely.<endOfText>
<human>Can I have one please?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh <endOfText>
<human>Here Cass.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh cheers.<endOfText>
<human>No there's all these erm<endOfText>
<bot>What a shit lighter.<endOfText>
<human>erm funny people on it.<endOfText>
<bot>Can't any of you lot afford Zippos or  <endOfText>
<human>A Zippo?<endOfText>
<bot>Why would we go out and spend fifty quid on a lighter that we'd lose after two weeks?<endOfText>
<human>Oh alright<endOfText>
<bot>I never lost mine yet.<endOfText>
<human>I've had my green Clipper three months now.<endOfText>
<bot>No I'm actually quite surprised at myself I've got two Clippers and both of them I found and I've had them for ages.<endOfText>
<human>I never give cigarettes  <endOfText>
<bot>Did you give that one back to Dan and Honey?<endOfText>
<human>You wouldn't give me a cigarette anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Oh come on, you know I would.<endOfText>
<bot>Just to shut them fucking complaining.<endOfText>
<human>It's my lighter, it's my lighter  why was it in my house then?<endOfText>
<bot>And Dan always keeps like everyone's magazines, you know everyone leaves their magazines round our house?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah well they're<endOfText>
<bot>He always keeps them.<endOfText>
<human>well that's because half the people that leave them there live in south London.<endOfText>
<bot>No I reckon it's <endOfText>
<human>Yeah I dunno.<endOfText>
<bot>No one usually asks for them back anyway so <endOfText>
<human>Yeah Emma did<endOfText>
<bot>Oh right.<endOfText>
<human>went in there with a twenty cigarette box erm two twenty cigarette boxes yeah?like when you see  cigarette and they pull out their fag, have you got a cigarette and  hold out the box  forty two cigarettes.<endOfText>

<human>Who, who would tell Cassie their secrets?<endOfText>
<bot>No it wasn't, the person didn't actually tell me<endOfText>
<human>I'd never tell Cassie  <endOfText>
<bot>it was one some<endOfText>
<human>Oh for God's sake.<endOfText>
<bot>it was someone else that told me but told me not to tell anyone and I had to beg it out of him cos I just wanted to know.<endOfText>
<human>Are they here now?<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Are they related to anyone?<endOfText>
<bot>No well not that I know.<endOfText>
<human>There is one, there's like things that I would never tell anybody<endOfText>
<bot>What?<endOfText>
<human>is that who fancies whoever or what <endOfText>
<bot>they're the two things that I'd never tell anybody.<endOfText>
<human>The only thing I don't really tell anybody is my<endOfText>
<bot>Or basically anything <endOfText>
<human>thoughts if I told someone my thoughts they'd be absolutely disgusted.<endOfText>
<bot>What ?<endOfText>
<human>Did you say pizza?<endOfText>
<bot>No   whoa whoa!<endOfText>
<human>Hello  <endOfText>

<bot>join them  <endOfText>
<human>Yes I look like shit.<endOfText>
<bot>no one 's actually talking.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah I know but who gives a shit.<endOfText>
<bot>And where's your microphone?<endOfText>
<human>It's here, I, I forget that it's recording so like when people aren't talking I just sort of think fuck it.<endOfText>
<bot>Everywhere he goes   <endOfText>
<human>No if people are having a conversation<endOfText>
<bot>Fuck it I wondered what the bloody hell that was !<endOfText>
<human>I thought <endOfText>
<bot>I think what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go and stand in front of everybody while they're trying to  just to annoy them.<endOfText>
<human>Okay go on then.<endOfText>
<bot>Stand behind them when they walk backwards.<endOfText>
<human>That, in front of Mohammed <endOfText>
<bot>And they've gotta try and walk backwards I'll just sort of go whoop!<endOfText>
<human>I used to, every time like when we was playing football at primary school <endOfText>
<bot>Whoop!<endOfText>
<human>every time somebody shot a goal all, everybody, they always walked backwards like a foot.<endOfText>
<bot>That's supposed to be a trick when someone attacks you, if they attack you from behind you're supposed to walk backwards.<endOfText>
<human>And like instead of running forwards while they grab on to you if you step, walk backwards it makes them fall over.<endOfText>
<bot>See what happens is they always  backwards even if they're right at the back of the field so you find someone you don't like and you go behind them trip them over  <endOfText>
<human>Didn't fucking work did it?<endOfText>
<bot>What?<endOfText>
<human>Oh!<endOfText>
<bot>I'm gonna break this  on the ground.<endOfText>
<human>Oh God I hate having so much shit in my pocket!<endOfText>

<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Right when it was pitch dark, yeah, I was half, I was still pissed and I was half asleep and you were p taking the piss out of me behind my back about that.<endOfText>
<human>When?<endOfText>
<bot>Catherine told me!<endOfText>
<human>What did I say?<endOfText>
<bot>No I don't know what it was but Catherine was t telling me the other day about how erm oh I told you something about that and you t and you t were talking to her about it.<endOfText>
<human>Well I wasn't taking the piss out of you, I might have told her.<endOfText>
<bot>Well she said you were.<endOfText>
<human>She said you were both taking the piss out of me.<endOfText>
<bot>And like you know it's not even always behind my back, you two always sort of I mean Cath when I'm not er I mean like I, I mean I'm, I've gotta, I've gotta tell you some time because when I'm on my own with Catherine yeah?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>She agrees with everything I say, she's never horrible to me, but when you're around she's really horrible to me and like, even though she's agreed with something I've said earlier, she just sort of goes yeah right Cassie ha ha ha it's really funny and takes the piss out of it and you sort of go along with her and I just sort of have to stand there while you two stand there laughing at me and I don't like it.<endOfText>
<human>But she makes me laugh though.<endOfText>
<bot>No it's, yeah well I know but I mean like it's not the point whether she makes you laugh.<endOfText>
<human>I dunno, whenever I'm with her though I'm always with you as well, like if I was with her right on her own<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>then I would like  er we'd just talk about, I don't know  whatever, she'd probably agree with everything I said as well because that's what Catherine's like but when she's like with the rest of us she  <endOfText>
<bot>I'm not, I'm not I'm not putting it on you anyway mostly it's c mainly fucking Catherine, I'm beginning to s not like her any more the way she's going  and don't you dare mention a word of this that I'm saying to you<endOfText>
<human>say anything  <endOfText>
<bot>but I've gotta, I've gotta, I know, I've gotta get it off my back though because it's really pissing me off.<endOfText>
<human>Anyway she can just be such a bitch sometimes you don't really know her that well you know.<endOfText>
<bot>No I know.<endOfText>
<human>No she does  to you though cos she's always going on about other people  talking about other people.<endOfText>
<bot>I know, I mean er I mean yeah I've got used to her sort of like criticizing everything and everyone in sight cos I mean that's all she ever does is to criticize and complain.<endOfText>
<human>I know but when I'm with her a lot I really  to talk about like  is about other people so like I do it as well but like I don't<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah well I do the same when I'm with her.<endOfText>

<human>but I like, I like Jenny really.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah I know I like Jenny I mean, but I never really say anything bad about Jenny.<endOfText>

<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>about me don't you when I'm not there, yeah?<endOfText>
<bot>No I don't, I don't.<endOfText>
<human>Well she might.<endOfText>
<bot>Well she might erm no she's never, I don't think, I don't think she ever has said anything, she might have said it once but not that I can  recall mys oh doesn't that look lovely with all them petals falling off the tree?<endOfText>

<bot>Have you seen our cherry tree in the garden ?<endOfText>

<bot>Yeah but I mean anyway I dunno I just get really pissed off with Catherine.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah but I get really pissed off as well cos I  well I, I won't like  when I'm with other people like and I talk about other pe like when I talk about Jenny and then I feel sort of like really two faced when I like start talking to Jenny and stuff.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah I know but I mean<endOfText>
<human>Cos I mean like do you do that as well, you know when you're with Catherine like you talk about people like Rosie or anybody  <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah yeah I d do I mean I do that, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I dunno who, who do I m I don't know, I d do that to s er see there is somebody that I do that quite a bit to but I can't remember who it is  or a few people maybe.<endOfText>
<bot>cos Jenny didn't even know that you could bloody put on weight by drinking.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah well it's a bit that's the truth though I mean that is a bit silly isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I mean I, I mean I dunno I mean I just, I just ha , I just had to tell you because I mean it really is pissing me off the way fucking Catherine treats me, she was alright before  like and when I'm on my own, no <endOfText>
<bot>What, before she met me.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah I mean I'm not, I'm not saying you're a bad influence on her now, I think she's  just sort of jumping in at the chance for someone to victimize personally.<endOfText>
<bot>And l and  especially yesterday yeah, you know when we were standing in the foyer after school yeah?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>And I, and you, you were going on about something to do with your job yeah?<endOfText>

<human>Deary me, I was well drunk I s I haven't been, I haven't been that drunk since the Playpen gig.<endOfText>
<bot>What, what did you drink?<endOfText>
<human>I mean <endOfText>
<bot>I drunk rum  I, I didn't have  <endOfText>
<human>got through about a third of the bottle.<endOfText>
<bot>I know and for some reason I was incredibly pissed.<endOfText>
<human>I can't really handle rum, that's why I didn't drink any last night.<endOfText>
<bot>No I know.<endOfText>
<human>I can a bit but<endOfText>
<bot>I ca I can't hold my spirits in that's the only thing.<endOfText>
<human>Well the thing is I can't handle rum cos when I went to that party Dan  had<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>No actually come to think of it I was really pissed at erm Dan  's party as well actually.<endOfText>
<bot>No no not Dan  's Bonnie's party sorry  and I, I'd had er <endOfText>
<human>Did Bonnie enjoy herself in the end?<endOfText>
<bot>Cos I know that like she said she did but I know she was getting really pissed off cos everyone was sticking on the music she wasn't interested in and stuff.<endOfText>
<human>Er yeah I think she, yeah she did enjoy herself, that's what she said to me.<endOfText>
<bot>Er I drunk erm  I think I drunk  two  two cans or maybe three cans of Scrumpy Jack and then a can of Supertricks and I was well gone I, I had to pass out.<endOfText>
<human>The reason I can't drink rum or vodka<endOfText>
<bot>Or any kind of spirit.<endOfText>
<human>or  is because<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>this was a long time ago  parties about two years ago<endOfText>
<bot>yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I drunk half a pint of rum, half a pint of vodka and three or four cans of  <endOfText>
<bot>Oh yuck!<endOfText>
<human>That is sick.<endOfText>
<bot>And I was really wrecked and I was I wasn't even actually ill I just sat, well I was eventually but I sat on this wall for about four hours, yeah<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>and it seemed like ten minutes, yeah, but like Jim came out and said do you realize you've been out here for hours man<endOfText>
<human>and like erm  just like all the  this party<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>but ever since I've never been able to handle it like I drink, sort of shove a few<endOfText>
<bot>But you drink whisky though.<endOfText>
<human>Oh whisky's easy.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah I know I mean like  I ca I, I can't, I can't hold down my spirits, I can hold down erm lager though.<endOfText>
<human>Well I dunno, I can't work out what I can drink best.<endOfText>
<bot>The secret of drinking is just to know when to stop, you know you've just got<endOfText>
<human>I know.<endOfText>
<bot>gotta recognize when you get to a certain stage that like if you drink any more you're gonna be ill.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah I know but I mean like my mum was saying that you know  sometimes you're just pissed to stop and you just com carry on and stuff.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Do you reckon Dan might let me have a bit of toast when I get back or something?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah probably.<endOfText>
<human>Cos I, I just wanna line my <endOfText>
<bot>I mean I think we have taken liberty a bit with his parents  but yeah I think you will be able to get some toast.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah it's, it's just I wanna, I don't, I mean I, like my dinner last night yeah was a packet of Whotsits, packet of  beef flavoured  Hula Hoops erm a packet of erm  Monster Munch er two chocolate bars and a can of Coke.<endOfText>
<bot>Monster Munch <endOfText>

<human>probably wouldn't get any sex  have enough time anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, no no I w I ate, that was my dinner, I ate that before I was pissed and that was my bloody dinner, I wanted to get some chips  no one would walk down the chippie with me.<endOfText>
<human>I had a nice dinner last night, I didn't have my chips but I managed to get <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I wish I could cook that easily.<endOfText>
<bot>It's dead easy.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah I know.<endOfText>
<bot>Just as long as you just as long as you know what, what doesn't go in what then like you can just chuck any old thing in.<endOfText>
<human>I'll cook curry or lasagne but I never knew, I never knew the recipes I just sort of  stuff and think that goes together well<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I mean Zed makes really really really really nice chilli.<endOfText>

<human>Yeah I know.<endOfText>
<bot>So he, he needs something new to do.<endOfText>

<human>I suppose   Nirvana are the best of a bad lot by a long way.<endOfText>
<bot>Then why is it Nirvana never played  yeah I suppose you, I see what you mean yeah.<endOfText>
<human>At least they bloody started it and they just didn't fucking jump on the bandwagon like everybody else.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah I know.<endOfText>
<human>Oh well they did actually cos they ripped off erm  what was that band before, I can't remember, Pavement they were before Nirvana.<endOfText>
<bot>Who?<endOfText>
<human>Pavement.<endOfText>
<bot>They were what?<endOfText>
<human>They were before Nirvana, they came from Seattle, they sound almost exactly the same.<endOfText>
<bot>Nirvana are just a rip off of them really.<endOfText>
<human>Except Nirvana are better.<endOfText>
<bot>Nirvana are crap though.<endOfText>
<human>I know they are.<endOfText>
<bot>Gotta listen to a little bit of <endOfText>

<human>How old are they?<endOfText>
<bot>I think  sound like the Stones.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah <endOfText>
<bot>Good though.<endOfText>
<human>They do.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think they do at all.<endOfText>
<human>They do.<endOfText>
<bot>Some of their songs do.<endOfText>
<human>And then he really looks like Mick Jagger as well which don't help.<endOfText>
<bot>Don't you reckon that erm the  are a bit of a copy of er Spinal Tap?<endOfText>
<human>are a copy of Spinal Tap ?<endOfText>
<bot>Well they, they all look the same.<endOfText>
<human>They, they  they  the people look the same as<endOfText>
<bot>They don't.<endOfText>
<human>They do, that geezer with erm  moustache and  hair.<endOfText>
<bot>He looks a bit like Derek Smalls I know but <endOfText>
<human>Did, did you know that erm Spinal Tap was a film before the band came out?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah cos I never used to know that<endOfText>
<bot>But you, you<endOfText>
<human>till I saw  <endOfText>
<bot>you seriously thought they were a real band?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah well they were kind of after erm the erm thing.<endOfText>
<bot>They weren't really they were just like<endOfText>
<human>Do you think they're good?<endOfText>
<bot>No they're music's terrible, they're quite funny though.<endOfText>
<human>They, they've got one good, really good riff on erm  er Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You er  der der der der der der der der der der der  <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah I know I like that.<endOfText>
<human>But I mean then, then again they don't do it very well.<endOfText>
<bot>Don't they?<endOfText>
<human>If they left it in the hands of  it would be a much better song.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Cos they, they don't play with that much conviction, well I mean suppose they're not really musicians but  sound a bit crap.<endOfText>
<bot>Bad News are much better.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>The music of Bad News cos <endOfText>
<human>what?<endOfText>
<bot>helped Bad News write most of the songs.<endOfText>
<human>Oh right yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So that one about erm  go insane and eat my brain baby  <endOfText>
<human>I haven't heard that.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh that's brilliant that one is.<endOfText>
<human>And like  what was that really good one?<endOfText>

<human>oh yeah I have seen Bad News but I, I don't remember it very well, I remember bits of it.<endOfText>
<bot>Bad news der der der der der bad news <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Well erm have you heard that, that song Warriors of Genghis Khan?<endOfText>
<human>What the nasty one?<endOfText>
<bot>What's that?<endOfText>
<human>Just  <endOfText>
<bot>The nasty one with the stupid  video?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah but they're just, they they're just, they're  they don't  do they?<endOfText>
<bot>They're just being really your average thick metal band.<endOfText>
<human>I wonder what, oi Dan  Honey, I wonder what, I wonder what we'll be like when we get into our sort of mid twenties?<endOfText>
<bot>Probably pretty similar to what we are now I should imagine.<endOfText>
<human>Do you reckon we'll still know each other?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah I reckon.<endOfText>
<bot>Basically if the band stays together then we'll just still know the same people because<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>We've gotta keep it together <endOfText>
<human>Oh we will, we're gonna keep together till we're very wealthy.<endOfText>
<bot>Hopefully.<endOfText>
<human>No well we'll, look we're getting quite, we're getting quite a lot of erm attention.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't mean like sort of you wish  like you wish that you  like you'll become rich or something.<endOfText>
<human>I do wish that <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>four thousand seven   four er forty seven yeah erm a grand total of forty seven thousand three hundred pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>What's that?<endOfText>
<human>How much you've got?<endOfText>
<bot>I worked it out the other day, I've got fifty eight P.<endOfText>
<human>Oh almost home.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah nearly there.<endOfText>
<human>Oi Dan  I've gotta, I've gotta play you, I've gotta play you later on of me apologizing to the Norwegians.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh why?<endOfText>
<human>Oh what did you say?<endOfText>
<bot>There's just this, it's just really funny cos I sound really wrecked yeah and I say  look hello, hello look Norwegian people  I just want to apologize for all this mess and all this crap on this tape but I mean yeah like you know, fuck it<endOfText>
<human>it's a laugh innit?<endOfText>
<bot>And then, and then Stitch sort of takes over <endOfText>
<human>and there's people  and then there's a bit yeah er someone said to Aaron you've got a bony arse and I'm standing behind you and I'm going yes Aaron you have a bony  arse .<endOfText>
<bot>Oh I said to Aaron that he had a bony arse, he does as well.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Well don't you think  embarrassing?<endOfText>
<human>No?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh I can't remember.<endOfText>
<human>Coming down, slowing into High Street passing Stoke Newington Church Street and the Samuel Beckett where they're really crap and like don't pay you properly  oh no<endOfText>
<bot>Don't they?<endOfText>
<human>no they do at the Samuel Beckett, it's the  and  okay, it's a good new Embassy advert  but I still don't smoke Embassy because they're horrible.<endOfText>
<bot>And  <endOfText>
<human>Sing it like, like glow in the dark Embassy or something innit?<endOfText>
<bot>I like Embassy filter actually, you know the really small cigarettes, they're quite cute.<endOfText>
<human>I wouldn't compromise with towels would you?<endOfText>
<bot>Don't you think those adverts for  erm the Vauxhall Corsa are really pointless?<endOfText>
<human>All those ones with the supermodels sitting on cars?<endOfText>
<bot>The er the T V advert's quite good, it's quite stylish but<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm sorry but does anyone actually use Stoke Newington train station?<endOfText>
<human>I don't think so .<endOfText>
<bot>Only the people that work there.<endOfText>
<human>But what I don't understand is though why we haven't got an underground station at Stoke Newington and why Stoke Newington train station isn't linked up to Whitechapel.<endOfText>
<bot>It isn't linked up to anything, it goes nowhere.<endOfText>
<human>I think there's just one bit of line going from there like <endOfText>
<bot>I, I think it goes to Canonbury and think it goes to Bethnal Green.<endOfText>
<human>Great!<endOfText>
<bot>Actually does it go to Bethnal Green?<endOfText>
<human>Cos if you got the train to Bethnal Green you could walk it from there to Whitechapel.<endOfText>
<bot>Well I'd rather not actually it's much better getting the one O six.<endOfText>
<human>There is an underground at Bethnal Green isn't there?<endOfText>
<bot>Coming up to my house pretty soon  but I'm not going there cos it's shit.<endOfText>

<human>What is potato and leek like?<endOfText>
<bot>Hello Norwegian people this is my fiance Honey  I love her very much.<endOfText>
<human>Ah!<endOfText>
<bot>What is potato and leek like?<endOfText>
<human>I do, it's true.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm <endOfText>
<human>This is Honey , Dan  's fiancee, this man    has the biggest  knob you will ever see in your life  and it's all mine  <endOfText>
<bot>What were you saying?<endOfText>
<human>About, I thought you said something about tea?<endOfText>
<bot>I said what's potato and leek soup like?<endOfText>
<human>Usually it tastes quite potatoey and presumably rather leeky as well I should imagine.<endOfText>
<bot>Hee hee hee yeah?<endOfText>
<human>I thought that was, that was a really good line in that cook thief his wife their lover film where he went, he said something about she's great except she will keep popping to the John and then he went she's got a bladder like a leaky marrow <endOfText>
<bot>Did he?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah  that was wicked .<endOfText>
<bot>I'd be bloody embarrassed if I had a husband that looked like that I'd throw him away.<endOfText>
<human>No man there is no way.<endOfText>
<bot>Hummus food of the gods.<endOfText>
<human>Pardon?<endOfText>
<bot>is that?<endOfText>
<human>What's that horrible smell?<endOfText>
<bot>It smells like Aaron's feet.<endOfText>
<human>Oh God I've never smelt, I didn't wanna say anything but like I've smelt anything so nasty in my life except for Patrick's knob.<endOfText>
<bot>Seriously those feet were nasty.<endOfText>
<human>Patrick's such a spastic.<endOfText>
<bot>Patrick could  <endOfText>
<human>You haven't slept head to toe in a bed with him though.<endOfText>
<bot>Aaron.<endOfText>
<human>No not Aaron.<endOfText>
<bot>Imagine that.<endOfText>
<human>No I, I, I sort of smelt Patrick's feet once  and I thought if it was possible to faint  on smells then I was going to, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>I swear to God they're the most nasty things  sort of like Aaron's   <endOfText>
<human>Dan  sweats nicotine.<endOfText>
<bot>Does he?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>He says his sweat smells of Benson.<endOfText>
<human>Urgh!<endOfText>
<bot>Disgusting.<endOfText>
<human><endOfText>
<bot>You are here, still going out?<endOfText>
<human>No<endOfText>
<bot>You're not now, oh right okay that's fine, the er, what I want you to do instead of writing, I mean two hundred words is, is probably feel nothing, but in fact because we want er it to be absolutely right, what I'd like you to do this time is just write an appraisal, the contents thing er that we had last time we had if you like, content and appraisal and audience, but audience was only er, a sentence or two, I'd simply like a, an appraisal, what your view of this is, if you're writing that part of the review, so we're only thinking in terms of a hundred words now, er what I'd like you to do is to distribute yourselves over the laboratory, erm go wherever you want but don't start talking with people, it's not the, not the Cribben thing I just want to get on with the exercise that I'm concerned with and write your appraisal, but obviously put your name on it and er  if we meet back here  thirty five minutes is that long enough for under a hundred words of excellent quality?<endOfText>
<human>Between er, er the best, the best end of the scale ones which I would of thought if they'd been submitted to something like a general<endOfText>
<bot>were almost erm okay  just like that, I mean there were one or two very good ones, I think there was one that was just about like that with the odd word and when an editor receives something like you, you know, it's usually going to be something he wants to change very slightly, erm that, those were the best ones, there were in general however you haven't yet got used to the idea of editing.<endOfText>
<human>I, when I took them back and looked at them, there were lots and lots of, of re er, errors if you like that if you had really looked at them you could of picked out yourself.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean if you're honest a lot of these were really first or second draft erm manuscripts I think and er  er you really got to get, if you're going to submit something like this it has to be er  it has to be absolutely watertight and you have to say exactly what it is that you want to say, erm some of the criticism I've, I'm not gonna mention people's names, but I'm just remind myself er, a whole lot of you for some reason erm,con construct things in sort of note form I suppose this being undergraduates that helps this and, and, but you construct things with single sentence paragraphs so that actually you get a whole list of sentences without any linking between them and that is terribly disjointed reading and with an account like that, when you've finished reading it, you sort of have to shake your head and think well what did the person actually say, and when it's actually looking for er a little bit of prose, the in addition some of your con your sentences are in, extraordinarily complex, you start off in a sentence and you actually lose your way in the middle of it, I mean the simple sentence's much the better thing, I mean I seem to remember being told by subject, object verb, in a sentence, they must have those, those, those things, well very often you'll have a sentence which starts with er a particular noun and as, as a subject and then finishes up with the same no noun or, or, or subject or, or maybe it's become the object of the sentence at the very end or maybe the sentence has totally lost it's way.<endOfText>
<human>And these are the kind of things really that you should be able to pick out because they just, if you like, they just sound wrong forgetting about how poor our knowledge of grammar may become over, over the years.<endOfText>
<bot>Er use of slang erm often comes into these, er these things, the, the sort of well footage er referring to the video isn't such a bad one because it's, it's in quite common use, but an awful lot of slang words, erm that people introduce er maybe I'll come across some in a moment.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, thank goodness for er modern technology I got them  please don't, don't all fax them up to the department, er these faxes are very hard to read<endOfText>
<bot>Some of the sentences there are extremely long, some of you use capital letters indiscriminately, every sort of fourth word, they're in capitals, I don't understand why that should be.<endOfText>
<human>One or two of the excellent ones was spent, was spoiled by a little bit of er need to erm edit very carefully  introdu introduction of concepts you must be careful not to, if you've got a couple of hundred words only, but don't introduce er concepts diversity of design must of been er a phrase picked up from the video itself because it appeared in two or three of them, but it's no use talking about diversity and divine is it,de design as if , as if it's a concept which everybody else is going to understand.<endOfText>
<bot>The teacher that reads your review that wants to know shall I buy that review,hi hire that video rather or, or what, am I going to use it for my class, they are going to er want that information and they don't want er concepts introduced which they don't understand what is meant by it, so be careful in that  er  erm, we have species of bird, the brambling, which I, I think is a pub in <endOfText>
<human>Rare bird<endOfText>
<bot>this is very swift, some of us when er<endOfText>
<human>I put on, on large number of them more editing is needed I, I think probably now going back, oh change of tenses obviously something you have to watch out for.<endOfText>
<bot>Anyway since editing is the main problem, what we're going to do this afternoon is, actually, I'm going to show you another video and again it's a very controversial one, again it's used in, in teaching situations, again it has a biased point of view in the sense that it's produced by National Power, er clearly as a P R job for introduction into schools erm and I want you to do the same exercise, but this time I want us to edit them among ourselves and  what I'm going to do is to get you to wri write your reviews and then we'll divide into small groups, while you're watching it I'll co I'll count how, however many people we've got here, we'll copy the reviews and in the same groups I want you to edit one another 's reviews and then er discuss them within the groups once you've, once you've marked them so we'll get into the small, we'll do the review  we'll write the review and then we will er, I distribute the, you can go and have a cup of coffee while we copy them, then we'll distribute them, you can mark them, er individually on your own and then we'll get into a group and you can criticize one another 's reviews, we'll take them one at a time, we'll probably be in groups of four, okay, but I'll see, I'll see how many, what the most suitable number is, okay so, if you, would you be kind enough to  that<endOfText>
<human>It's the brambling<endOfText>
<bot>The brambling<endOfText>
<human>rambling is the word ramble<endOfText>
<bot>Well if you'd put the sound quality was poor, I thought it better than rambling when it was, when it should of said brambling.<endOfText>
<human>Rambling isn't that what old fogeys did in the weekend?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah <endOfText>
<human>It didn't work very well did it Stuart?<endOfText>
<bot>What's that?<endOfText>
<human>That, didn't come out.<endOfText>
<bot>The faxing?<endOfText>
<human>Er?<endOfText>
<bot>The faxing?<endOfText>
<human>No, it didn't work that well<endOfText>
<bot>No, and er, I mean I can do, I could read it so er  but I did<endOfText>
<human>It's a bit poor.<endOfText>
<bot>It's a bit blurred, yeah <endOfText>
<human>Sorry you were given<endOfText>
<bot>What, what are you carry on doing today?<endOfText>
<human>I mean do you want us to hand another one in?<endOfText>
<bot>No, well you founded the, the projects, but apart from anything which are<endOfText>
<human>Right, right, right.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I realized that er, my handwriting may not be desirable, but er, pardon<endOfText>
<human>Okay, are, are you ready then with whatever notes you want to take?<endOfText>
<bot>What's, what's the video called?<endOfText>
<human>Okay the video's called Electric Ecology  it was actually produced by er the Cen er Central Electricity Generating Board which doesn't actually now exist  it's become the National Power and Nuclear Electric hasn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm and what it says on the blurb on the cover is that the power stations of England and Wales are surrounded by larg large areas of land which are often remote, uncultivated and undisturbed by man.<endOfText>
<human>Electric Ecology looks at the surprising variety of plants and animals that have co colonized this land and that the efforts that are made to monitor and foster this wild life.<endOfText>
<bot>The running time is twenty six minutes, we might as well get that right, we had er, er several people commenting on the running time of the other video, but er people had different of estimates, anything from fifteen to twenty five minutes.<endOfText>
<human>Sorry you<endOfText>
<bot>No I was about to ask how long it was.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, er right <endOfText>
<bot>Power stations produce electricity for our homes and industry, they're surrounded by thousands of acres of wild land   This wild land has developed into some of the nation's most remarkable nature reserves   For seven days a week, twenty four hour a day routine at the power station can provide unique and also surprising cover for all kinds of wild life.<endOfText>
<human>Power station fitter Bill <endOfText>
<bot>They're, they're built in remote places so you've got all the, the er wild life around them and then you've got er farmland which uses pesticide and stuff like, which kills off the insect life and to birds all young and stuff like that.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, by having know that the land grows the weeds and no pesticides not disturbed, there's no shooting, they're never shot around here, the birds can come in sheltered, you know, they, they're just like a little nature reserve, protected area, game park you know, nothing shot at just left and er they like it obviously, I mean it's like anything once it learns that er it's gonna be left alone it comes again and again.<endOfText>
<bot>It's, it's living in harmony I suppose will be the word you know the, the environment sort of moves in to the power station and doesn't get attacked, everywhere else gets attacked you know, people scrub up the weeds in the garden and things like that, here they're allowed to grow, the butterflies come in, insects, great you know just, just love it.<endOfText>
<human>And Bill  loves the wildlife, he's a dedicated bird- watcher although he hardly looks like it when servicing the huge polarizers that turn coal into a fine powder for burning.<endOfText>
<bot>This powderized coal is the fuel for the power station.<endOfText>
<human>Like great coffee beans these machines must wind fifteen thousand tons of coal each day.<endOfText>
<bot>Seventy five per cent of Britain's electricity is generated by coal fired power stations<endOfText>
<human>Not for much longer.<endOfText>
<bot>Ash is produced when the coal is burnt and has proved to be something for the salvation for many plants and animals  the ash is so fine that it has to be turned into a slurry and put into the  to settle out  these can be up to eight years during which time it becomes none the less but an artificial mud flat quickly colonized by weeds, pioneers crucial to the complex way of life in our natural world  But for bird-watchers it is the bird that attracted to these artificial mud flats that are the most exciting development within the boundaries of these power station nature reserves.<endOfText>
<human>It'll soon be better  for the power station management Bill  has built a hide to monitor the bird population<endOfText>
<bot>The reason we built it on this particular spot is this is the ash flurry from the boilers from the bottom there of the er power station and er it's contents of slurry dried out, dried out and graded, well once nice and flat like this it gives the bird an ideal opportunity to  at high tide and they can see around, there's no vegetation, it's very bad ground, and er, that is load of ducks, a good numbers of er oystercatchers, they don't  sometimes, which is really nice and so easy to count them now cos when the tide is out and you've got the, the mud flats of course they're spread out, now they're nicely condensed down here, so it's great, great little position for us you know, that's all courtesy of the bottom of the boiler, you know, you know, give us this nice  <endOfText>
<human>Hardly the  oystercatcher isn't all that fussy about its nesting site.<endOfText>
<bot>This one has found a cosy hole in an insulation, covering a disused pipe to an oil fired power centre.<endOfText>
<human>Such oddities can often been spotted, because to the birds and animals a power station is simply a secluded often borne refuge from a hostile world <endOfText>
<bot>When, one, one of the changes I'm trying to do at night is, is to make the nature reserve more attractive to all species.<endOfText>
<human>If I, if I get another species next year nesting, that hasn't nested before and I know it's because of the effort of putting in reeds, trees, whatever I've put in there, we're, we're trying to get  to nest here, if they nest that'll be really, er that'll be a great thing because er they feed on the apple erm I thought somebody said er who said there was a hundred a seventy five here er a week ago and that'd be great to get them to nest, be really good.<endOfText>
<bot>As the ash dries hard it is dug out for sale for the construction industry, yet another habitat is created  With the  layers of  rock compacted over millions of years, this soft ash forms perfect artificial gifts for burrowing animals like rabbits  For this young fox, what better place to practise digging than a soft cliff of ash, watched nervously by potential lunch  Another predator not necessarily fond of the ash, but very keen on the animals that it attracts, is the polecat ferret  Once used by poachers many of these agile hunters are now wild and range freely over the rough ground near power stations in search of prey  Round at the top of the ash  are the nest borrows of one of Britain's rarest bird, the sand martin  the monitor of this power station has ensured special  in there so the birds can find ideal nest sites.<endOfText>
<human>He's even arranged for holes to be drilled into the ash to give the sand martins a head start  These days secured nest sites for these beautiful birds are increasingly rare.<endOfText>
<bot>This artificial ash cliff is perhaps one of their last strongholds   have also found refuge around our fire stations, protected from tramping feet and sheltered from chemical sprays these rare plants thrive in the damp salty margins alongside the ash lagoons  all this within the boundaries with just a few of the country's coal fired power stations  but the need for sea walls of other coastal stations merely intake pipes to the coaling system, another world teams  this is not a plant, fan worms have flowerlike mouth parts used to filter food from the sea water  other worms use just two sticky tentacles to catch food   shrimps forage over closely packed sea  the delicate bodies of these printed vertebrates work as tiny water pumps, pulling water in one hole and pumping it through the other  here two barnacles feed in the gentle flow of water over the cooling pipes from the station  Marine life quickly packs the underwater structures and is about to become too thick and sometimes affect the performance of the machinery  barnacles belong to the same family as crabs and lobsters, but being in their adult life standing on their head which is fixed to the concrete  they use their feet to filter the water and kick food into their mouths  but if they can't move, how do they get there so quickly in the first place?<endOfText>
<human>The answer is that after mating they produce a tiny mobile larvae totally different to the adult  this might drift for miles on ocean current before settling into the fixed adult form  Down Norwick power station in North Wales, generates the electricity by pump storage, in off peak hours thousands of gallons of water are pumped from a lower lake to an upper lake, when the demand for electricity is high bowels are opened and water falls back through turbine to the lower lake again, this generates the power  To ensure that the lower lake would never flood the  was diverted through mile long tunnel in the mountain side, no one knew for certain how the salmon, the trout and even rarer  that used to migrate up the old river would cope with the tunnels, pitch darkness and slow flowing water.<endOfText>
<bot>To find out a new research programme was started, fresh water biologist Doctor Alistair .<endOfText>
<human>A lot of people, some, some people  well you should of  and  and er many other people say that this wouldn't go through, particularly them the  going through the tunnel.<endOfText>
<bot>The research team have travelled two kilometres into the tunnel to net the fish close to the intake  checking the catch is an exciting moment <endOfText>
<human>Oh there's a char, there's a lovely char here, these lovely chars er actually spend most of the time in big cold lakes and they're a, they're a population in  they normally respond in December from about December the second to the fifteenth and they've probably been isolated since fourteen thousand years ago, with that every population has gone slightly different to, to the next one.<endOfText>
<bot>Later the catches are surveyed in detail<endOfText>
<human>Well here, here are char for example, this is a female, you see the, the white line on the fins and the very pale pink spots, this will actually get gradually more highly coloured until about December when they will be quite bright red, and, and in my opinion  not a question really, but might be that some of these other ones are pretty nice as well here's quite a, quite a dark little trout, probably been in the light for quite a long time, right now  nevertheless  that's a female as well just a couple more famous small ones here, that's a young salmon, that's really a beauty.<endOfText>
<bot>These little thumb print things along the, along the sides are called the  marks and the  down to the sea those marks disappear and you get this silvery appearance, so it's very plain if you've got these that the salmon has been up there just  in the upper  which is exactly we had, hope we had happened <endOfText>
<human>Female shark and then thirty<endOfText>
<bot>As part of Doctor  's research the char is painlessly tagged before being released back into the lake.<endOfText>
<human>When in the future later recaptured the tab will help scientists piece together the life history of these ice age relics  Doctor  is to find out whether the migrating salmon are actually producing young in the upper reaches of the river Nantpose.<endOfText>
<bot>To do this Doctor  and his team use specially made apparatus that momentarily stuns the young fish  the research programme is continuing, but the results so far are revealing just how well the salmon co-exist with the high tech world of electricity production<endOfText>
<human>There's some that are going up at the moment to this pond, they develop them for the next three years to spend their life in the fresh water feeding, and what we're trying to do here is to see just how many there are in, in the river er as a total.<endOfText>
<bot>Well what we do is we patch up all we can't  a hundred yard stretch.<endOfText>
<human>We then mark them and release them again because we, the electro thing doesn't harm them in any way <endOfText>
<bot>This deluge of warm water produced by the cooling towers of the power station is as close as we'd come in Britain to a tropical monsoon.<endOfText>
<human>It's a vital part of the process of generating electricity.<endOfText>
<bot>The water is nearly gone from a local river and of course is filtered before it passes through the tower, fish as fry or eggs inevitably get through, craving in the warm oxygen rich pond under the tower.<endOfText>
<human>On the rare occasions when the cooling towers are  for maintenance, the staff wait eagerly to see what the pond reveals.<endOfText>
<bot>Today the catch includes chub and  fish associated with clear oxygen rich water now moving towards the maintenance.<endOfText>
<human>Eventually  a time of fish will be landed  so the intricate work of life moves itself into the most unlikely corners of our power stations.<endOfText>
<bot>But when the time comes to close, this delicate balance between gleaming efficient machinery and the secret world of nature can relent the man made, now nature takes over, unfettered by schedules or the relentless hurry into the night shift, it creeps into the bare workings of the place and then it's not the rest of the world within a world.<endOfText>
<human>Now echoes of the great turbines has faded and new a workforce starts to earn its living.<endOfText>
<bot>soon find their way into the building and settle down to rear their young within the  of pipes .<endOfText>
<human>The droppings they create will need to contact flies which in turn will be  to the spiders whose garden of webs will soon bale the windows .<endOfText>
<bot>The flat roof becomes like any piece of bad  a potential home for pioneering weeds and grasses.<endOfText>
<human>More weed and  a seed quickly becomes established in cracks on the asphalt  In future years even willow trees will be in a foothold  to  these doomed power stations stands firm and proud as it slips  and silently into decay<endOfText>
<bot>That's them go in there.<endOfText>
<human>But the circular life is the start of natural history  As the years turn towards  migrating birds will give a clue to the success of the fledglings hatched earlier in the year.<endOfText>
<bot>This nest set up on the flat lands beyond the power stations on the south east coast will provide the evidence to Bill  and his bird watching colleagues    It's not only the owls that fly at night, waders will feed at any time, but the rising tide will force them to leave the mud flats day or night<endOfText>
<human>Bird in the bag, a hundred and nine  take her out  right ring plummer, time?<endOfText>
<bot>Time now, time is<endOfText>
<human>Ten, ten past two, what is it two at ten?<endOfText>
<bot>Ring number<endOfText>
<human>Er, O five<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, it's been there for quite a while.<endOfText>
<human>His job is so delicate that to ring birds like this Bill  has had to train for two years under the watchful eye of a certified ringer.<endOfText>
<bot>Well er a possibility innit?<endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah<endOfText>
<bot>Quite possible  a wedding ring for the bird    A hundred and thirty.<endOfText>
<human>This is quite a nice bird<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah <endOfText>
<human>and er a nice white belly on it, on the wing, we'll put him back into the marsh shall we?<endOfText>
<bot>With that we'll see if we've got any more   it's er, have to go down here which has got a bit of light, still some birds moving around and the birds calling, go and check the nests now.<endOfText>
<human>We're gonna let this one go down the slide, until it runs off, there he goes , the light's gone  <endOfText>
<bot>It was only now that appreciate what nature has known all along.<endOfText>
<human>The plants, birds and animals, here in solitude and stable environmental conditions to fly.<endOfText>
<bot>do not care whether the pipes,in our power stations help generate power to support human civilization.<endOfText>
<human>As far as they're concerned these places are a home, safe and free of danger.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, well now, what I would like you to do please er because we've only got a limited amount of time, er incidentally some of you still haven't divide collecting er a small group going with Peter  I<endOfText>
<human>We are still going.<endOfText>
<bot><endOfText>
<human>This is the second talk in a series following the history, sort of Victorian fashion, but not just what people wore but hopefully explaining why they wore it, both the actual manufacturing, physical why they wore it and perhaps some of the psychological reasons behind the changing fashion.<endOfText>
<bot>erm You missed last week's talk, which actually was quite lucky because the projector broke down, so it wasn't a great success; but last week, erm I talked about the beginning up to the eighteen thirties, Victorian costume, and really what I was trying to put across last time, was the fact that the nineteenth century saw the beginning of fashion for the masses.<endOfText>
<human>Instead of fashion being mainly, well almost totally an upper class preoccupation, it became, because of the ease of manufacture and because more clothes were more readily available and cheaper, it became one, something that was worn by the middle classes, gradually sort of percolated downwards.<endOfText>
<bot>With the invention of things like the spinning wheel, spinning jenny, the spinning mule, erm mechanized weaving, the Jacquard loom which wove patterns, all these helped the manufacture of cotton, the manufacture, the manu, the spinning and weaving of cloth.<endOfText>
<human>erm We saw the beginning of the factory, industrialization, big manufacturers where lots of people worked and where cloth could be churned out at a very fast rate, and therefore, cloth was cheaper.<endOfText>
<bot>From America, the development of the slave plantations, cotton plantations, meant that far more cotton was being sent over to England, so as well as wool, you also have the choice of cotton garments, which were much more popular because of course, they washed very easily.<endOfText>
<human>And as long as you didn't choose something that had a very bad dye, in which case it would all run, but mostly it was very light, it was easy to wear, even easy to clean, so it was an immensely popular fabric.<endOfText>
<bot>The eighteen twenties and thirties saw fashion moving from the Empire line, which was, had a very small bodice and a skirt that  flowed down straight to the ground to a lower waisted dress with big sleeves and a shorter skirt, and the impression of a little girl, a little sort of bouncy girl who was all skippy and everything, which reflected really the feeling of optimism at the beginning of the nineteenth century.<endOfText>
<human>The growth of the middle classes as industrialization became, got under way, men, more men earned their money, so instead of having two classes, the working class and the upper class who spent their lives in leisure, in idleness, you got another class of people who had to earn their living, but who still made a lot of money.<endOfText>
<bot>And the reason for a, a lot of fashion and a lot of change in the fashions, one of the reasons is because these men had, needed some way of showing off their wealth.<endOfText>
<human>Previously, in the eighteenth and seventeenth centuries, a man himself could dress and show how wealthy he was, and when man started going to work he had to wear a respectable, responsible suit; he had to put across the image of honesty, of, you know, I'm, I'm a respectable man, I'm decent, I'm down to earth.<endOfText>
<bot>So really man's costume changed very little, and in fact, apart of the cut of the jacket, and the type of hat you wore, it carried on right up to the present day.<endOfText>
<human>So the man needed a way of showing how wealthy he was, and he did that by having a large house, by having lots of servants, and also by dressing his wife, I mean by having a wife who didn't have to work, who could stay at home, and wore clothes to show this, so you get the beginning of incredibly impractical clothes which showed that the woman obviously didn't do any work, because it was completely impossible to do any.<endOfText>
<bot>Now the eighteen-forties sees the development of manufacturing process, clothes are getting easier and easier to make, cheaper and cheaper, so fashion is changing faster because people can afford to, whereas in earlier times, if you wore a woollen dress, it had been you know, you know, somebody had done the sheep for you, had spun the wool and woven the wool and you were damned if you were going to take this dress off until it fell to pieces round you.<endOfText>
<human>Now that clothes were, had become cheaper, people could afford to change them more often and buy new ones, so the fashion changes became more rapid.<endOfText>
<bot>And another way of showing how wealthy you were was to keep up with the fashion ‘look, I can afford to wear this year's dress, I'm not wearing last year's or the year before's’.<endOfText>
<human>I'll start the slides.<endOfText>
<bot>Is this in your way?<endOfText>
<human>erm No, it's not,, I can manage to squash round.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm just trying to focus it actually,.<endOfText>
<human>Right, that's as good as it gets I'm afraid.<endOfText>
<bot>This is a very out of focus picture of a drapers' shop.<endOfText>
<human>And the picture is actually to show you how people bought their cloth, how people bought their dresses.<endOfText>
<bot>Until well into the eighteen forties, they didn't actually buy dresses, they bought lengths of cloth and had them made up, either by a member of the household — a servant perhaps, or more often by a dressmaker, either a couturier or the local dressmaker.<endOfText>
<human>So they would actually do the shopping for the material, and then they would go away and look at pattern books and decide what sort of patterns they wanted, what sort of dress it was that they wanted to make.<endOfText>
<bot>By the eighteen forties, you just had the beginning of home dressmaking.<endOfText>
<human>Now I think this came around, about, because you get the, the people, the women who want to wear fashionable clothes, it's getting broader and broader and we're sort of expanding downwards as it were, so you get women who have enough money to buy the material, to buy patterns, who have the skill to make dresses, but haven't the money to actually get a dressmaker to do it for them.<endOfText>
<bot>So it becomes very much more common with, among sort of lower middle classes, the people who are working their way out of the working classes.<endOfText>
<human>Also in the eighteen-forties, you actually get the beginning of department stores.<endOfText>
<bot>Previously, if you wanted a dress for example, you'd buy your cloth at the drapers, you'd buy your bits and pieces at the haberdashers, erm you'd go to the milliners and the glovers and all those different sorts of shops.<endOfText>
<human>In the eighteen-forties, the department stores really came into being with places like Debenham and Freebodys and Selfridges, where everything could be purchased under one roof, which made things much easier.<endOfText>
<bot>erm I think it made things a lot cheaper, because you had larger firms able, able to buy in bulk, and also the beginnings of the ready-made market.<endOfText>
<human>Now in a big department store, say like Debenhams, you could go in, and you could select your cloth and get the ladies round the back to make it up for you.<endOfText>
<bot>Or you could buy dresses, one or two dresses that were all complete except for the seam down at the back and the seams under the arms.<endOfText>
<human>You know those skirts you can buy in Liberty's, the skirts and blouses that all you need to do is zip up the back?<endOfText>
<bot>It's that sort of thing.<endOfText>
<human>They weren't terribly popular, I don't think, because of course, the women were used to a personalized fit, and when you get, start getting mass production like that, then obviously a lot of the very good fitting garments that, I mean that's just not possible.<endOfText>
<bot>And fashions of the eighteen-forty did rely quite a lot on very close fitting garments, so I don't, I think that's the reason why they weren't more popular and didn't develop faster than they did.<endOfText>
<human>Oh good.<endOfText>
<bot>That's better<endOfText>
<human>It's back to front,<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes!<endOfText>
<human>Now look, you can't have everything!<endOfText>
<bot>Right, this is an extremely good slide, I did take this myself, erm of the actual dress of the eighteen forties, I'll just sort of point out its components.<endOfText>
<human>You've got a quite high neck, it was a lower for the evening, I mean most dresses all the way through the nineteenth century, and now being lower for the evening.<endOfText>
<bot>But most of them would have a neck that was quite high; modesty was getting to be a really important factor, so we're covered from head to toe.<endOfText>
<human>The sleeves and shoulders are very sloping — can you see it's sort of, the line's gone very drooping, I mean somebody said it gave the impression of melting butter, and, and that's really the sort of figure that you've got.<endOfText>
<bot>Any fullness of the sleeves at all, and as you go through the eighteen-forties, the sleeves gradually get tighter and tighter; what little fullness there is comes either below the elbow or, or just on the elbow itself, so you can see the fairly, they are gathered sleeves, but the actual shoulder piece is very tight.<endOfText>
<human>The bodice itself is very well fitted, very closely fitted and the women were very tightly corseted.<endOfText>
<bot>This again, from the health problems of the early eighteen hundreds, eighteen-twenties, which caused a great deal of pneumonia and chills and fevers and all that because women would insist on wearing muslin and very little else.<endOfText>
<human>Now you get the health problems caused by over tight corseting, which led to constriction of lungs, of ribs, in some cases, punctured lungs, a lot of cases of T B in the eighteen forties were in fact where the corset had compressed the ribs so tightly, that they'd actually punctured the lung.<endOfText>
<bot>Not .<endOfText>
<human>erm This also meant that you couldn't move around very fast, the clothes were so tightly made, that for a large part of the time, you were immobile and glad to be, glad to be so.<endOfText>
<bot>And dresses are getting fuller — haven't actually reached the crinoline stage, but a more uncomfortable sort of stage where layers and layers of petticoats, so, over your undergarments you'd wear like eight or nine flannel cotton petticoats to give an impression of fullness.<endOfText>
<human>So in fact the crinoline, although in some ways it had its disadvantages, I think it was a good deal more comfortable than, than wearing a lot of petticoats and being very restricted like that.<endOfText>
<bot>The colours were very subdued, very, very sombre, erm dove greys, muted blues, nothing bright at all, now this wasn't because of dyes, although later on in the eighteen-sixties when chemical dyes really took off, the colours were correspondingly garish and bright.<endOfText>
<human>This is really to sort of reflect the feelings of the times, which I will come to, so that's basically fashionable dress in the eighteen-forties.<endOfText>
<bot>That's even better, but I didn't take it.<endOfText>
<human>This is a picture of Florence Nightingale and her sister who has an unpronounceable name, this is in the eighteen-forties, and this really summarizes I think, the psychological reasons behind the changing of fashion; this shows the ideal woman of the eighteen- forties.<endOfText>
<bot>You had to be the, the perfect woman who was one, who had grown up from the little girl of the eighteen-thirties who was all bouncy and skippy and optimistic; now she had to be very quiet, she was admired for her innocence, for her delicate nature and her dainty physique.<endOfText>
<human>And it was her duty to be guided by an intellectual judgement and authority that was superior to hers — in other words, her husband's or her father's.<endOfText>
<bot>She was supposed to be very, very quiet, she had to, I think complete submission was really the key point of women in the eighteen-forties.<endOfText>
<human>And the costume itself enforced this, if you can imagine, you can see, see their upper sleeves, this is actually quite full round here, but the upper sleeves are quite tight, which means that you can't move like this very easily.<endOfText>
<bot>You were very tightly corseted, which makes any exertion almost impossible because if you can't fill your lungs to take enough air then obviously you can't take enough exercise, which is why a lot of women would faint with shock or horror because any sort of sharp intake of breath, and they'd be flat on their backs, unconscious.<endOfText>
<human>Full skirts — goodness knows how many petticoats made walking very hard, so all this almost enforced leisure upon them, and this was again part of the duty of the woman to show that she didn't need to work, she didn't in fact even have to lift a finger because the man or her servants would do all this for her.<endOfText>
<bot>In eighteen oh six, erm a law was passed which said that all property of a woman went over to the man on their marriage, including herself, so the woman was no longer an individual, she was just the property of the man and she could be disciplined and punished if the man felt like it.<endOfText>
<human>Obviously, I think there was, erm sort of a thin line between grievous bodily harm and a good beating, but a lot of women, a lot of middle class and upper class women, were in fact beaten and disciplined quite severely, and we have records of this, you know, from people's diaries, that actually talk about it in a very manner of, matter of fact way.<endOfText>
<bot>There's a quotation here from one of the ladies' magazines at the time: ‘woman was given to man to be his better angel, to dissuade him from vice, to stimulate him to virtue, to make home delightful and life joyous, in the exercise of these gentle and holy charities, she fulfils her high vocation’— pretty inspiring stuff!<endOfText>
<human>The ideal woman was of, was purity and doing your duty and domestic.<endOfText>
<bot>I think it was copied from Victoria, Victoria had a lot of influence upon women obviously, she had a lot of children; women too, women, apart from the fact there was no effective contraception, it was the duty of woman to bear a lot of children so that they could carry on the line, which was also why woman had to be very chaste and pure so that man could be sure that the son that she produced was actually his legitimate heir.<endOfText>
<human>So there was another sort of factor of passing down your wealth that made the women's chastity so important.<endOfText>
<bot>I've called it, the talk, ‘Little Dorrit’ because I think the character in the book by Dickens really shows the ideal of womanhood in the eighteen-forties.<endOfText>
<human>Now, I'm not going to go into a discussion about Dickens' view of women, which was fairly peculiar, but I do think that the popular feeling of the times was very much inclined towards the ‘Little Dorrits’.<endOfText>
<bot>I've got some quotes here that I've taken from the book which shows not only how Dickens thought women ought to behave, but how the readers, since he was writing for a public market, the readers too thought the ideal woman ought to behave.<endOfText>
<human>We have heard her described as: ‘a diminutive figure with small features and a slight spare dress; she was little and light, noiseless and shy’.<endOfText>
<bot>And another: ‘it was not easy to make out Little Dorrit's face, she was so retiring, a delicately bent head, a tiny form, a quick little pair of busy hands, what affection in her words, what compassion in her repressed tears, what a great soul of fidelity within her, how true the light that shed false brightness round her’.<endOfText>
<human>It's a bit unfair on Dickens taking out such incredibly ghastly stuff from his book, but I, I do think it shows, it shows how women were expected to behave.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, this is a fashion plate; a ball dress in the eighteen-forties, and I'm just showing this actually to make another point; sort of change of direction maybe, because I'm now going to almost undo everything that I've just said, and say that this was the fashion, high fashion of the eighteen forties.<endOfText>
<human>But please don't go away thinking that every Victorian woman in the eighteen- forties went around dressed like this.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that's like saying ‘every woman in the nineteen nineties went round dressed in Chanel and Yves St Laurent, or something equally as wild as that.<endOfText>
<human>I know in, was it eighty-nine, there was a fashion Yves St Laurent put, putting, was putting out a fashion for women to walk around with one breast bared, now in Oxford I just saw nobody dressed like that!<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know about you, but maybe they were dressed like that in London, but I don't think so.<endOfText>
<human>And I think where the confusion sometimes comes, is that the costume you have, the, the actual evidence of what people were wearing, a lot of it comes from fashion plates, and it's like saying, erm judging what people in the nineteen-nineties wear from Vogue magazine.<endOfText>
<bot>It doesn't give a very realistic picture; again a lot of the costume in museums, it gives a distorted view because the clothes that people keep are generally their best clothes — their ball dresses, their wedding dresses.<endOfText>
<human>The collection at Woodstock has goodness knows how many silk wedding dresses, but it would be wrong to assume that every Victorian woman went round dressed in a white silk wedding dress, because they didn't.<endOfText>
<bot>I actually have at the back which I will show in a minute, a costume that was worn by a woman in the eighteen-forties, and it shows how she has kept up with the fashion; it is a fairly fashionable dress, but it is adapted for real life, for day to day life, for for the life of an ordinary middle class woman who had perhaps one or two servants, but had to do the running of the household herself.<endOfText>
<human>Could I just ask you, did those bodices do up at the back with hooks and eyes?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, that's one of the interesting things about this.<endOfText>
<human>When I first saw it, when I was looking at it, I was amazed at these huge great hooks and eyes, and I thought ‘gosh, they can't have been very good at making hooks and eyes if they had to make them so big’.<endOfText>
<bot>But actually, because they were very tight, they had to be whacking great things so that they wouldn't bend under the pressure.<endOfText>
<human>Yes so they're actually the least attractive bit of the dress, I think is the fastening and the boning underneath.<endOfText>
<bot>Here we are: now this was worn by one of the Dew family who actually donated a large collection to Woodstock.<endOfText>
<human>And it was worn in the eighteen forties, and they were a very ordinary, ordinary family, I can't remember what Mr Dew did, but I mean, it was nothing special, he was he was just an ordinary professional man I think.<endOfText>
<bot>Maybe they had one or two servants, but a lot of the household, running, was left to her.<endOfText>
<human>You can see it's, it's quite short actually, and I don't, I mean, she wasn't that small, because you can tell by the, the rest of the, the size of the bodice and the length of the arms that she wasn't as small as this dress would make her out to be.<endOfText>
<bot>So it's actually quite short, and you can see here that it has in fact been shortened, and also you can see the terrible stitching with which it was done.<endOfText>
<human>And this is another fallacy that really struck me when I saw this; you imagine Victorian stitchery to be uniformly fine and perfect, twenty stitches to the inch and that sort of thing.<endOfText>
<bot>Now we do have some dresses that are like that, but the ordinary ones, I think were made in, because she needed a new dress and she needed it pretty soon, so some of the sewing is just terrible.<endOfText>
<human>And particularly, erm you'll be able to have a look later.<endOfText>
<bot>But the bit fastening the waistband to the skirt is huge great stitches and very coarse thread, which is actually a bit of a shame.<endOfText>
<human>But she put it up here, I think probably to make it easier, I mean if anyone's had, I don't know if anyone had children in the seventies when it was the fashion to wear very long skirts, or even as I find going up and down stairs in my nightie, you're more than likely to fall and break a leg and the baby's neck at the same time, if you wear a long skirt.<endOfText>
<bot>I think they found that it just wasn't practical to wear very long dresses; it was alright for dressing up, but not for every day.<endOfText>
<human>The bodice is quite small, but it's actually not as, you read about eighteen inch waists, I mean this is nowhere near an eighteen inch waist, and although she would have worn corsets, she obviously didn't wear, you can see there, so much corseting that she couldn't move, and that she couldn't bend down if she had to.<endOfText>
<bot>So that the, the dress reflects fashion, you can see we've got a slightly puffed sleeve and it's quite full here, but it is tight at the shoulder, and the shoulder itself, here we are, sort of slopes down, so you've got the basic line of the full skirt, a bodice at the waist, and this is very pretty, this pleating here.<endOfText>
<human>There it is.<endOfText>
<bot>But it's been adapted, it's been worn by an ordinary person doing everyday things, and I think that's, it's something that's, it's very important to remember when you're studying Victorian fashion and Victorian costume, that actually a lot of the documentary evidence gives a very biased picture and that to find clothes like this, I think you get a much more realistic picture of what people actually wore.<endOfText>
<human>And sort of, I think it shows a lot the timelessness of, of costume and clothes, because this could be worn, I mean I'm, you'd get a few looks, but I mean it could be worn today and it's quite, it's awfully Laura Ashley isn't it <endOfText>
<bot>Mmm <endOfText>
<human>I mean it, perhaps that's where she gets it from.<endOfText>
<bot>But I mean, I could wear this, especially in Oxford, you can wear almost anything.<endOfText>
<human>And, and not look extraordinary or out of the way at all, and I think all true clothes, I mean true sort of timeless costume, you can wear at anytime.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, that's it; next week we'll move on to the eighteen fifties and sixties.<endOfText>
<human>Does anyone have any questions?<endOfText>
<bot>Well a comment really, I was sitting browsing at Blackwell's sale, and they've got at half price, a beautiful book I was skimming through, with photographs of Victorian fashion, if you're interested <endOfText>
<human>Oh right, is that on sale <endOfText>
<bot>A great big tome of a book, ++ <endOfText>
<human>But erm, again a comment, she's not a very good dressmaker.<endOfText>
<bot>Look at the difference of the pleating at the, of the tucks at the bottom <endOfText>
<human>Yes,<endOfText>
<bot>They vary enormously <endOfText>
<human>We can see yes, yes <endOfText>
<bot>Yes, and she's obviously tacked that up, but you can see the stitching round the waistband, and she's repaired it, but even here <endOfText>
<human>You don't think it could have been the lady of the house's dress shortened for a maid <endOfText>
<bot>Possibly <endOfText>
<human>It's got a false hem on it you see, so it's obviously <endOfText>
<bot>That would give it weight as well.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I mean this would help to keep it down.<endOfText>
<bot>But if you'd got enough fabric, you would have just done the same <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>With the same fabric.<endOfText>
<human>I know this was actually worn by her, I don't, I, I'm not sure whether it was given to her maid, I don't think so.<endOfText>
<bot>erm I think she did actually just put it up.<endOfText>
<human>I thought the erm department stores didn't get here until eighteen-sixty.<endOfText>
<bot>Well not according to‘the book’.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, Selfridges obviously came much later, that's was absolutely correct with that.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, yes.<endOfText>
<human>But I thought erm, I didn't realise that they'd got the <endOfText>
<bot>Fineoak , Fineoak and Silkcounters <endOfText>
<human>It looks like the Army and Navy have been going for hundreds of years, Army and Navy Stores <endOfText>
<bot>Yes, I, I've got this from the History of Debenhams,Fineoak and Silkcounters <endOfText>
<human>When, when did actually Debenhams start then, do you know  <endOfText>
<bot>I can't remember the actual year, but I know, I mean it's by the eighteen forties, it's the eighteen forties.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Did they have sewing machines in the eighteen-forties <endOfText>
<human>Eighteen-sixties.<endOfText>
<bot>Eighteen sixties <endOfText>
<human>It wasn't until eighteen sixty-five that you got one that didn't, you know, erm that did lockstitch and not chainstitch.<endOfText>
<bot>That'd make all the difference, didn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>But that was terribly expensive, terribly expensive, I mean in eighteen ninety-nine, they were six pounds and a farm labourer then was getting seventeen shillings.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I know, I think, I think hand stitching went on for, I mean, I mean certainly further, where you need vast quantities of linen, like baby linen, a lot of that sort of hand .<endOfText>
<bot>Could you say something about the gloves?<endOfText>
<human>I take it <endOfText>
<bot>I wear gloves when I'm dealing with costumes <endOfText>
<human>Oh!<endOfText>
<bot>No, though these are my gloves, it's so that I don't get perspiration on the, on the dress, yes, or rings or anything, so <endOfText>
<human>I thought they looked still modern!<endOfText>
<bot>Yes <endOfText>
<human>Yes, they're surgical gloves, but they're just to stop, to stop them, erm, it, it erm rots the fabric.<endOfText>
<bot>How've you stopped the material rotting, anyway, it's lasted very well, hasn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Yes it has <endOfText>
<bot>Do you hang them up, or?<endOfText>
<human>They're hung, they're hung up on polished hangers usually, I mean it's packed in acid-free tissue paper, and I wear gloves when I, I mean, you know, handle <endOfText>
<bot>Generally when they're folded they just go, just like that, I mean <endOfText>
<human>Perforated silk, I mean silk, even if it's hung up and looked after very carefully, it just cracks with age, which is very sad, I mean some of our wedding dresses are just, the skirts are literally in shreds, you know, where they've just got <endOfText>
<bot>How many dresses does the County have in the collection?<endOfText>
<human>Ooh!<endOfText>
<bot>Actually, I mean, we've got a big costume collection, I mean it's sort of, you're talking thousands of garments altogether.<endOfText>
<human>They're not on show because displaying costume is very difficult, because you have to have very strict environment control; and light has to be very dim and you have to watch the relative humidity.<endOfText>
<bot>And you can't let people touch them so they have to be in glass cases which are hugely expensive and take up a lot of room, and the director is not very interested in costume.<endOfText>
<human>Which I think is the main reason actually.<endOfText>
<bot>So you send people over to Bath, do you, to see it.<endOfText>
<human>Well, when it's open, it's not open at the moment, I think it's opening in April, re-opening in April ninety-one.<endOfText>
<bot>How long does you happen to have in his family, how long have they been in the collection?<endOfText>
<human>I mean, amazing that that lasted so long through <endOfText>
<bot>Yes, you'd expect <endOfText>
<human>Seventy-four, they came in to the collection in seventy-four.<endOfText>
<bot>So they've kept a very long time.<endOfText>
<human>George Dew was a collector, I mean, he gave his whole collection to us, I mean, he just collected everything.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh I see, I see <endOfText>
<human>All sorts of things.<endOfText>
<bot>I, I just wondered you know.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, that's why we're very lucky, I mean because, because people don't keep stuff like this, so erm yes, we're very lucky to have it.<endOfText>
<bot>Good, thank you.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you very much<endOfText>
<bot>Right<endOfText>
<human>What's, what's next week?<endOfText>
<bot>The eighteen fifties and sixties.<endOfText>
<human><endOfText>
<bot>I think that's the right<endOfText>
<human>Born at hundred and twenty two  Willenhall.<endOfText>
<bot>One of a family of six and me elder brother was  me bro me dad had a little business in the keys in  and er they were hard times and me elder brother  we used to go and work for him because me dad said he must and er from, after school I used to go and perhaps do the errands or a bit of filing, the odd jobs and all that sort of thing and I grew up with locks and keys and files from twelve, even before I left school.<endOfText>
<human>I didn't leave school till I was fifteen.<endOfText>
<bot>I said to me mother, I ain't going to work for me dad like our Albert did.<endOfText>
<human>I'm going to get a job on me own.<endOfText>
<bot>And we had a neighbour named  and he'd worked at E T N S all his life and had some influence and I mentioned it to him and he asked me, asked me if he could find me a job.<endOfText>
<human>He asked the masters and they said you can come for an interview.<endOfText>
<bot>I went for an interview at E T N S in  now where it is and er they said can you start today and I said no.<endOfText>
<human>er, so er  no that wasn't  no <endOfText>
<bot>Started at   <endOfText>
<human>Started at  that's right, yes  and er  I did and er they put me in the machine shop filing keyhole  and  Those times they had to be all cast over the rim locks and all that, now they've made for us and all that.<endOfText>
<bot>But er I did two or three hundred, four hundred, five hundred a day and I got fed up on it and I said to the gaffers one day, if you don't change me from this job I'm leaving, so they says oh we don't want you to do that, best filer we've had.<endOfText>
<human>So a fellow named Mr  worked at  he was a neighbour, I got talking to him he says I'll mention it and you can come.<endOfText>
<bot>I got this job in the machine sh in one of the lock shops and er  for a fellow, I worked for him and er after I'd been working for him they wanted me to work for somebody else but this fellow wouldn't let me go.<endOfText>
<human>He says he's, he's my bloke, he's gonna stick with me.<endOfText>
<bot>So I had to work with him till I was about twenty or twenty-one or something like that, you know.<endOfText>
<human>Then I was able to er  go for my own self, you know and er I went on doing locks, one thing and another, best I could and all that sort of thing and I  worked for a, a bloke  what was in there er be a little bloke but he was the best locksmith in the shop and I went to help him and er  he used to give me all the  to do and this and that and the other.<endOfText>
<bot>He had separate orders, each locksmith and at this time I'd done all the ord whatsit er  and this and that and the other and I said what's next?<endOfText>
<human>He says there ain't nothing else next and er so er I stood there and I said  this, kind of like this I've gotta do something so er  I went er to pick sommat up down the back  but before that he said, here you are, he says I put these ready all you gotta do is put the screws in those  locks you know,like.<endOfText>
<bot>And he says, I says listen, young man, the locks  I ain't gonna put them in, and this is true, and he said well if you won't do that you'll do nothing else at all.<endOfText>
<human>So I stood by the vice for quite a time and then I went to pick something up, turned round, told you, you do that you'll do nothing else.<endOfText>
<bot>So  I left and er went out the shop.<endOfText>
<human>I asked the gaffer  I says can I get out?<endOfText>
<bot>He says you're  out and I  not yet I said.<endOfText>
<human>Well, I went home and I got another job and it, then I went back, I says can I have me card?<endOfText>
<bot>He says yes if you're paying me a week's wages and I says I can't do that.<endOfText>
<human>He says, well then, he says you could or you couldn't you haven't served a week's notice.<endOfText>
<bot>It's one or the another.<endOfText>
<human>So I had to serve a week's notice and I went down this er  what's the name of it?<endOfText>
<bot>where I went to work down there and in a month they put, it was amongst a shop of  about sixteen men and they all had separate orders and the men had got little lads working for them, you know.<endOfText>
<human>But there was a foreman in the shop, but these did their own job er and er in the  about three or four weeks, and I'm only a kid, erm they had me doing separate jobs you know, not for a gaffer or anything and er they used to, they give me odd jobs as, you know like, to help the men and er it went of like that in  till I was eighteen or nineteen, well twenty, that time you were, day, become a man.<endOfText>
<bot>Er one time the locksmiths had a rise from ni eighteen, twenty to twenty-one a man, it was a big rise but the locksmiths' union they altered it from to twenty and a half, twenty-one, twenty-one and a half, three rises before you went from a lad to a man's raise, you know.<endOfText>
<human>Well that happened and er I was man and er  they er brought me all the odd jobs that was going about and they used to go down the warehouse and er there was a fellow there, well a woman more than anything, know'd where every thing was and in no time at all they showed me where the things were and er I er, young, it was in my memory, and in no time at all the men in the shop used to come and ask me to get them something from out the warehouse for this and that and the other.<endOfText>
<bot>And in no time at all erm they were all more or less depending in some small way on me, and I was just absolutely lapping the situation up, you know what I mean, just suited me fine.<endOfText>
<human>And er  after a time, they wanted to know if I'd take complete charge and I said well yes I said, but what are the men gonna think?<endOfText>
<bot>And they said we don't mean to be over the men, but what we mean is for you to come down the office, no what the office wants as regards orders, and be responsible and pass them out to the men who you'll think who'll do the job best and all that, and that's what we mean.<endOfText>
<human>So I said alright, I'll do that, and I did.<endOfText>
<bot>And it meant that I had free access to the whole of the  so much so, I had a key to the bottom of entry in er  access to the firm and I could get in when I liked.<endOfText>
<human>They put complete trust in me you understand what I mean?<endOfText>
<bot>And er I'd got a key to get in from the works into the office once I was inside, but that was access to the works  you know and er I er  I en I enjoyed it more or less and I must say the firm, to some extent, looked up to me and I'd only got to have a damned machine stop, where the girls was working on this machine, and the bobbin shop and all that sort of thing, and I was able to go look er, down and say look here I want this.<endOfText>
<human>Well, whatever they was doing, they'd drop and do whatever  I said it, and it was the same with the bobbin shop, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>Mind you these was instructions from the office to me, telling me what I, what they wanted and I had to carry it out.<endOfText>
<human>And er, then I should go to the bobbin shop and ask them if they could get these done today and er, well we got this on, I said no but I, we want it  if you could leave them on one side and erm  I used to er  I, I became, if I might say so and I'm not boasting or bragging or anything, Michael, I'm trying to tell you the situation as it was and er I was a very important man to  and er they er  got me er at one time to er figure out, they, they used to make what was called Woolworths locks.<endOfText>
<bot>It's rather surprising to you, but they used to sell them in Woolworths for sixpence.<endOfText>
<human>they had to sell them for three and threepence, three farthings.<endOfText>
<bot>And they were sold in Woolworths for er sixpence.<endOfText>
<human>Er you can't imagine this I don't suppose, but nevertheless it's true and in a time, the men in the shop  they was mass-production, you know what I mean and they wanted this or that or the other, well I had the authority to go down the machine shop and tell them, look here, so and so wants this you do that.<endOfText>
<bot>And we had four casters  in the works and I had to go and sort out the, I'll tell you about the  find the castings that these men wanted for their lot, take them down to the  castors and tell them in priority which I wanted, you know and er all that sort of thing and erm I hadn't used to do any, making  any locks  hardly at the end, you know I had, I had before but er if I might say so, er I became mo the most important man on the factory, you know.<endOfText>
<human>And er I never heard or had any more ways than ordinary.<endOfText>
<bot>This was in  was it?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, that's right in  That's er, that's where it was, my lad and that was the entry as I used to get access from  remembering it ain't quite like it was now, my lad.<endOfText>
<bot>But there was a big door, well I used to get in the entry from, with an ordinary key, used to go up the b up the op big opening and open the big doors from the insides, you see what I mean, for the rest to come in.<endOfText>
<human>And erm there was half a dozen shops and  quite a few, spent most of me life there.<endOfText>
<bot>I le I left there starting to work on me own.<endOfText>
<human>As a matter of fact, there was about, I got four month in this one particular shop and there became sixteen men, in this shop, that was working for me and er  er we, I instituted a bonus scheme.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh two or three years before, only it turned out, after a time, that the men were earning more money than me because I, the bonus, you understand, it was a good thing for the firm, it was a good thing for the men.<endOfText>
<human>It was a bad thing for me, strictly speaking, because the men became as they was earning more money than me and this is complete fact.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm I had a go at one of the gaffer's.<endOfText>
<human>I said look here, you've put me in a job I reckon I've done it alright, the only thing is it's me that is the worse off now.<endOfText>
<bot>I says I'd like a rise.<endOfText>
<human>They said oh  that's alright.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, it came to the  and it was in the shop and they said what do you want?<endOfText>
<human>And I said a Pound  and they said what?<endOfText>
<bot>I said a Pound.<endOfText>
<human>They said we'll give you five shilling and I used this very, very  I said you can stick that up th wear it in your arse  and that's the truth.<endOfText>
<bot>And they looked like that and I says, what, I says, they've caused these men to earn all this money  I says they're earning more money than and that's all you're gonna offer me?<endOfText>
<human>And it brought about the bridge, Michael.<endOfText>
<bot>I said <endOfText>
<human>I said er, Irene come from Manchester.<endOfText>
<bot>nothing at all.<endOfText>
<human>No, nothing at all about the lock and two years after  closed and it was because of this because the men on the phone told me so and er anyway brought about the bridge and er  I er  accepted it, you know what I mean, it was that was it, I'd done it myself.<endOfText>
<bot>But I was walking in the market place, shortly after, only about just over a week after, and I met an old fellow who had retired from  Hello Graham!<endOfText>
<human>What you doing?<endOfText>
<bot>Not much  I says no  I'm out of a job.<endOfText>
<human>He says what!<endOfText>
<bot>I says you hear what I said I've got  I explained a bit to him he says, I tell you what, there's something going down   He says they don't make nothing there, he says, but they buy anything and everything.<endOfText>
<human>He says it's come to my knowledge cos er they want this and that and the other.<endOfText>
<bot>So he says you ought to go down there, you can mention my name.<endOfText>
<human>So I went down and Mr  at that time was Mayor of Willenhall, a very influential man, and he was er over  and er his son had to became in charge, but anyway I went to see him it was Mr  and er about it and he says er well we got er a order for four locks here, he says er I wonder if er you could quote me for them?<endOfText>
<bot>I says, well I'll have a look and quote.<endOfText>
<human>I, I says, I'll let you know sometime today or tomorrow and er  anyway, he was expecting me to say at least two or three or four weeks you know er because I'd put the situation I had no tools, no nothing and erm I er had a look at it and I thought what I could do, and I says I can let you have them in a week.<endOfText>
<bot>What!<endOfText>
<human>He says, I can, I can let you have them in a week.<endOfText>
<bot>He had an old brew house there and on the side of the sink there I built a good staunch bench  about like that square, put a vice on it you know.<endOfText>
<human>And I'll say this now, they was in business there, nextdoor, and I knew them like that, they says any machinery  come here and use it, and they'd got shears and all that sort of thing, and with their help, you know, I had these four locks and did them and took them down in no time to m to er, to  and they was flabbergasted because of the quickness of them, you know, and they says er we can always find you sommat to work if er this is the case.<endOfText>
<bot>So I er carried on with what they found me with this  in the brew house  and then er where did I go from there?<endOfText>
<human>You went <endOfText>
<bot>Then I went, that's right me<endOfText>
<human>I would've, me brother and I would've got a pub  in  erm excuse me asking these questions because it's a bit vague, you know <endOfText>
<bot>that's fine, don't worry <endOfText>
<human>and er <endOfText>
<bot>and er in the piece of property at the back of the pub, down the opposite side of the road, down a lane you went on to and there was a football field, couple of football fields there and prior to this, they'd have to  if they could use this little place as a stripping room and he said yes.<endOfText>
<human>Well  when he said I could come it was er September.<endOfText>
<bot>So I worked down here and nights up there preparing it and all round this, this place was coat hooks and that, where they all hung their things and I had to knock them down, you know what I mean, and fix me own benches up and er I'd got a little treadle lather and er sufficient for me to start.<endOfText>
<human>And then, after a time, we er had the er electricity took up the yard and into the shop and then we was able to buy a little  machine you know what I mean and it went from there.<endOfText>
<bot>And I supplied, ooh couldn't tell you the firms.<endOfText>
<human>As a matter of fact a fre fellow named  lived in  here and he was a traveller to er  George  he's one of the best, biggest rim lockmakers in the town, anyway, they're on this erm  now and er  he was going round for orders for regulars of his, for his firm and somebody, one day, asked him look here, we've got a little awkward job here, you know anybody the can you do it?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh he says we couldn't do that he says that now, he says I couldn't get that done for you.<endOfText>
<human>But after a thinking he says listen, leave it with me, I'll see what I can do.<endOfText>
<bot>So they did that and he came and sorted me out.<endOfText>
<human>I dunno how he knew about me.<endOfText>
<bot>But he came and sorted me out and I asked, I said I'll see what I can do and I got hold of it and I did it for him.<endOfText>
<human>And he was bringing orders right, left and centre off of his clients.<endOfText>
<bot>England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales Michael, no doubt about it.<endOfText>
<human>And in no time at all, I didn't have to ask for jobs, I'd got more than I could do, you know and er I was still, very well taken care of in the shop.<endOfText>
<bot>It was a lovely shop, bought it up here up  But, me brother left the brew left the pub and er it meant that I had to get out you know.<endOfText>
<human>Well with about forty visits to er  Walsall, the council and different other  departments<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, that's right love.<endOfText>
<human>Two friends of mine and they says er c can we find you a place in our  that's right love.<endOfText>
<bot>Er Arthur  and er played for Walsall football club, Arthur  but er they, little shop there.<endOfText>
<human>I cleared that and fixed the vice up and they said I could do that and I used the  and that in their place and er then they had to  quit the premises completely, didn't they?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean they'd got to be out for er couldn't tell you, Christmas or something like that.<endOfText>
<human>Poor Mr  died and <endOfText>
<bot>Mr <endOfText>
<human>they had to come out and<endOfText>
<bot>Arth Arthur  Arthur  had retired.<endOfText>
<human>His pal  his workmate was retired and a few months after, Arthur  died, so it left me the one and the owners of the property, they give me notice to quit and no messing about er and when I talked to them, they give me twelve months, rate free, to erm  get out.<endOfText>
<bot>And as I say, I was able to get in touch with me brother and fix this little shop up there and er no I've said that I've er, I've er<endOfText>
<human>You don't come <endOfText>
<bot>Eh?<endOfText>
<human>You don't come <endOfText>
<bot>famous London fair.<endOfText>
<human>But er<endOfText>
<bot>The ship that the Queen sailed on and Princess Elizabeth <endOfText>
<human>I'll tell you about that in a minute and then er  I er had to go about forty times for permission.<endOfText>
<bot>That side of this ro industrial, this side is residential and that's strict, you know what I mean.<endOfText>
<human>But this premise was there at that time and by  oh I had to go to a great extent on a number of visits and they er  granted it me on compassionate grounds and there's er I was only looking in the back of there the other day and there's one there now.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos there's er due to retire d in, in nineteen forty-two, nineteen eighty-two, a three year licence to own that premise there.<endOfText>
<human>You know, this is how it was first and I only come across that but, how it went, they felt I was genuine I suppose and they could trust me and they left it as it was and I had me own building.<endOfText>
<bot>I had er I sent the dimensions to the firm at Oxon and er I had to go to the bank and borrow the money, because you see the money I paid  if I don't pay cash I'd gotta have six months delivery.<endOfText>
<human>And they er, I ordered this the one Saturday and two weeks after they come and put it up.<endOfText>
<bot>That was how it was, two weeks after and er<endOfText>
<human>It was otherwise six months if you don't pay cash.<endOfText>
<bot>If I don't pay cash and er been the best thing I ever done and its been sufficient, you know what I mean and er all the people, there ain't nobody in this town that I ain't worked for, sometime or other.<endOfText>
<human>All the odd jobs they've sent to me and my stock-in-trade was special-purpose items or customers' requirements.<endOfText>
<bot>I never ever had a running line as I could offer anybody, although you know when the museum come, when I had orders for two or three dozen.<endOfText>
<human>If I had an order for thirty-six I'd make thirty-seven, you know what I mean.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos, in case there was a mistake and  on one side and I, and I had quite a number of things accumulate in that way you know.<endOfText>
<human>But I never ever had a running line, although they did  have an order for so many like that and I'd keep the patterns and the gages and if they wanted any more later on, you know, I used to do that sort of thing for the sake of me customers and all that.<endOfText>
<bot>And er  they er  went around the town and if anybody wanted anything, it, this applied to local householders and all that sort of thing.<endOfText>
<human>When they was doing the decorating and that and a lock went wrong oh take it down to Dick  and er they'd bring it and whatever I was doing, however important it was, just because they'd be finish the decorating at night and they wanted to put the lock back, I'd drop what I was doing and do this for them.<endOfText>
<bot>And I was gonna tell you this.<endOfText>
<human>I don't know whether you'll think I'm boasting but that isn't the case, but I never ever regretted it and it  a great deal of respect for me, you know and I could see that and did appreciate it and I know the people appreciated it just the same and erm  it's gone on from then till now but about, I retired in seventy-three, I was sixty-five and I said I'd only do what anybody wanted for me, cos they had me in for the tax and I never ever heard  twenty-one I think it was or thirty-one  in come and I'd go before I could satisfy them at Walsall but er I'd got, not got enough money to be taxed in the bank, which was true.<endOfText>
<bot>please understand me, but no thousands of Pounds is er taxable, see what I mean they've never, I should never applied and they had to send about oh above twenty returns, yearly return.<endOfText>
<human>I was up till three o'clock in the morning, very often, getting these prepared because they wanted them as quickly as possible, you know and er  er  it was the same when I, I don't know when <endOfText>
<bot>Mm?<endOfText>
<human>Where are you now?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, well er I was saying er  it was this Mr  I think it was, but it was to do with  er a big firm in  at the time and they wanted er some locks at Liverpool <endOfText>
<human>There was a big firm in Liverp Birkenhead and there was a big firm in London.<endOfText>
<bot>It was er international company  sommat like that Ching and er  they asked me about it and I said I'll see what I can do.<endOfText>
<human>So er what was it er?<endOfText>
<bot>You, you made them  <endOfText>
<human>And er, that's right and they told me what they wanted and er that's right, there was a hundred and fifty-five locks.<endOfText>
<bot>Five different kinds for different parts of the ship.<endOfText>
<human>About thirty in each suite to differ and a master key and  as I say there was five suites and they had to make a key that'd open everyone of the fifty-five.<endOfText>
<bot>Yet, there was five separate master keys to each suite.<endOfText>
<human>This is applied because of the wards, you understand what I mean.<endOfText>
<bot>I had to keep more or less the leverage more or less the same because you couldn't differ them and er I er had that job to er do for  and er it was the H M S Gothic and they was going to South Africa and er when er they was on, in the middle of South Africa on the coast  one of the royalty died.<endOfText>
<human>Queen's father.<endOfText>
<bot>George the fifth<endOfText>
<human>Her father.<endOfText>
<bot>Her father died and they had to come back from their, this particular  and come back.<endOfText>
<human>But I made their  locks for H M S Gothic.<endOfText>
<bot>Hundred and fifty-five locks, five suites, thirteen a suite approximately and er a master key to each suite and a gras grand master to take the whole lot.<endOfText>
<human>And there was some sliding door locks and some er lift-up locks.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm some of the doors slide, like backwards and forwards, and some swung on hinges which is er totally different, do you understand?<endOfText>
<human>He used to  at his brother's shop.<endOfText>
<bot>But  it was my  it was my  customers' requirements.<endOfText>
<human>This is what they wanted and I undertook to do it and I tell you, all me life I've been able to and have done that.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes <endOfText>
<human>I know you hadn't finished them had you when they was ready to set sail.<endOfText>
<bot>No<endOfText>
<human>And they sent a big  from down there <endOfText>
<bot>Oh ah <endOfText>
<human>Doctor  had to fit, fetch a little parcel  <endOfText>
<bot>Yes, when they was fitting them on the H M S Gothic they sent, they  Birkenhead and I asked if they, so I stopped work, all Saturday and this, this er big er  were it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah <endOfText>
<bot>From Birkenhead to take these two three lots and he could put them in his  but anyway, they were all gonna be done <endOfText>
<human>when he were down the town hall.<endOfText>
<bot>They, they were all done and it's coming back clearly now.<endOfText>
<human>This is perfectly true and he thought he'd be back the same day and he wasn't.<endOfText>
<bot>But because he wasn't, I worked as hard as I could until dark, about night time, to get them done for the next day.<endOfText>
<human>And he says well, I can wait till tomorrow, better than going back and coming again.<endOfText>
<bot>So er I went down the Red Lion in Willenhall and fixed him up for a night's dosh, didn't I, and the driver and then er I worked on, worked on and on and was able to get these er done for him to take back to fit this ship.<endOfText>
<human>Cos it was due to sail on the same day, on the Sunday, you know what I mean and er it was these locks as I'm telling you about and her   a very, very famous firm and er my correspondence come from London because he had offices was there, you know and erm  our erm  I've been at the service as I, if I might say so, but in most people it's surprising how it get's round and er  the jobs that I've had to do.<endOfText>
<bot>They come once from Tetnall church.<endOfText>
<human>It er they'd had a fire there and they wanted to know if I could replace the lock.<endOfText>
<bot>I said certainly.<endOfText>
<human>Well, they'd got the skeleton that wanted a big brass lock but er oh  you know, lovely and er it was more trouble getting the thing through the pan to get er the case than putting the insides in it, if you follow what I mean.<endOfText>
<bot>But it was for the lock from the people, you know and he, he got round like this, and this is the God's truth as well again, he'd come to me from America and er they, I had to make locks for certain people they called them statos, status symbols there, in their own houses, you know, where they put this lock on and anybody  as he's got one like that, you know and from America to Dick  in Willenhall to make them.<endOfText>
<human>We've, we've got some <endOfText>
<bot>But this is the truth,Mi Michael.<endOfText>
<human>We've got some of those big gate locks as well, you made one of <endOfText>
<bot>Have you?<endOfText>
<human>those as well, yes that, that you, you made, yeah<endOfText>
<bot>Yes<endOfText>
<human>Yeah<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, yes well as I say, you're coming into the shop and I don't know what was in now I couldn't tell you, but anyway <endOfText>
<human>And the lighthouse locks you made <endOfText>
<bot>Yes, yes the lighthouse locks.<endOfText>
<human>The lighthouse locks, yes <endOfText>
<bot>Oh, the lighthouse locks that was wonderful.<endOfText>
<human>I made lighthouses, locks for li lighthouses all round the world, Michael.<endOfText>
<bot>This is the truth my lad and the first I made for was for the that, just off Canada, is is New Foundland?<endOfText>
<human>New Foundland there, there was a lighthouse there and er because these people worked together, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>It's the same as everything and everybody and because er they were satisfied with it, they wanted some more and they took the old lo lock off and put some more on what I'd made, see what I mean.<endOfText>
<human>And I made locks for lighthouses, I'm not boasting my lad, and they'd li locks, locks for lighthouses pretty near all round the world.<endOfText>
<bot>And onto ou round Australia and that and I mentioned I started in New Foundland, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Used to be lovely to go on a trip with him.<endOfText>
<bot>big er houses, you know.<endOfText>
<human>You'd lose him when you got inside, he'd be examining the locks on the doors.<endOfText>
<bot>Ah <endOfText>
<human>I'd say where, where'd you go?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, he's looking at that lock there.<endOfText>
<human>You, you mentioned also a bit once, when I came before, about the erm the, the lock for the cricket ground.<endOfText>
<bot>Was it Lord's?<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes <endOfText>
<bot>Lord's, yes <endOfText>
<human>I made four locks for the gates on Lord's cricket ground er and when I'm telling you this, and practically without exception, they must've er got to know me and they come for what they wanted.<endOfText>
<bot>Couldn't really tell you what it was now, but I made four locks for Lord's cricket ground.<endOfText>
<human>There was four gates on the ground apparently.<endOfText>
<bot>They was gate locks.<endOfText>
<human>You wouldn't call them like flashy locks or  you know, like mortice as you fit in the door or anything like that.<endOfText>
<bot>It's what the customer required, gate locks.<endOfText>
<human>They'd gotta be secure as you could imagine and er not easily  picked, if you follow what I mean and er yes, made I made four locks for Lord's cricket ground.<endOfText>
<bot>Did, did the big companies like Parks and, and Yale and so on.<endOfText>
<human>Did they come to you at all?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes they did, but very, very  seldom.<endOfText>
<human>They er they used to come at the first, and I'll tell you this and I, it's my opinion, they got one of their own men  er I'd foxed them off, you know what I mean, to do their own odd jobs.<endOfText>
<bot>It was much more convenient than putting them out, see.<endOfText>
<human>But I have worked for the Yale and Parks's in the very first instance, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Why, do you want to say sommat then, what?<endOfText>
<human>When , when you were working at  what sort of lock were you making there?<endOfText>
<bot>Was this, this was the coin lock, coin- operated locks, was it?<endOfText>
<human>Er well, they made.<endOfText>
<bot>The re the essence of  was they made more or less the customers' requirements.<endOfText>
<human>Now, the Yale and Union locks  they'd got a certain type of locks that they produced and it was all done with a system, you know what I mean and more or less come to assembly and er they did that.<endOfText>
<bot>But these firms, as I said, they wanted this or that or the other and with er because of this fellow Mr  he did nothing to get it out of his so it just happened, you know what I mean.<endOfText>
<human>And I'll send that to Dick  and he'll fix you're up and saved them going to the lot of trouble on their own er ground.<endOfText>
<bot>Money was, particularly, no object, you follow what I mean, people in that kind of business.<endOfText>
<human>I never ever charged enough, never ever charged enough, but they said Dick  will fix you up, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>And their odd jobs, they'd probably got men in their own factory to do it, but no they sent them to Dick   and I er used to oblige.<endOfText>
<human>And er I was well known if I might say and proud of this Michael.<endOfText>
<bot>Well respected and they'd all er have a word me anytime and I could go into any office you know what I mean and er  yeah.<endOfText>
<human>they was mortice locks weren't they?<endOfText>
<bot>we, we worked in my shop, that's what I was telling you about.<endOfText>
<human>There was quite a few men and  made more or less the customers' requirements and when I was in charge, there was sixteen and they, about in two or three parties, er you know and they'd make different kinds of locks what was ordered and not particularly er mortice or rim er what the customer required.<endOfText>
<bot>Didn't they make the slot locks?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>That's what he wanted to know.<endOfText>
<human>Yes and er I er  they got me on that and I'd er seen a bit on it before hand  one way or another, but I went to a place and, and asked them if I could er  see and er they showed me and explained it, the er the way to er.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos you could put one coin in or two and er sometimes th there was halfpennies and pennies then.<endOfText>
<human>Well, you put halfpenny through, it,th th th the gap was too wide and it went right through.<endOfText>
<bot>If you put a penny in, it was like that Michael, whereas a penny could  it come like that and held it.<endOfText>
<human>It moved two things which put it into operation, you know and er I could turn the knob and it'd get the whole thing going, it'd get you inside, it'd register that it'd been, when you shut the door, as soon as you shut, in the toilets, as soon as you shut the door the penny dropped down, see what I mean.<endOfText>
<bot>It was, you opened it and come out and shut, shut the door and you'd lose the penny then they'd got to go through the same operation with another penny, you know what I mean.<endOfText>
<human>And er I erm I organised a lot of that sort of thing erm by er  it was exact measurements and spindles and you know like  Erm yes, I couldn't remember a lot now but er  a lot of people, if I might say so, used me you know, Michael, my knowledge and skill and I allowed them to and I'm not complaining.<endOfText>
<bot>Well they're used to them slot locks on the toilets, aren't they?<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah <endOfText>
<human>Where where did you learn most of your, your skills as a locksmith?<endOfText>
<bot>Was it at  or <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>or bef before then?<endOfText>
<human>Yes because I went to, I only had a few weeks at er  and that was  and I wouldn't stick that.<endOfText>
<bot>I says I want to learn sommat so I went to  and I don't know what it was, whether it was my attitude, but they, they asked me to do this and I was so good at it, so they started finding jobs for me and it was at  and I was anxious for knowledge, and I tell you  took anything on, which is important and the big firms didn't.<endOfText>
<human>As a matter of fact, I'm saying earlier on, that the big firms send them to  you know to er<endOfText>
<bot>They were mass-production  <endOfText>
<human>Whatever, whatever  want or could get, oh bring it here we'll do it.<endOfText>
<bot>They used to come to Dick  see.<endOfText>
<human>Wh what, what sort of hours did you work when you were at  did they, did they change <endOfText>
<bot>Only or <endOfText>
<human>over the years?<endOfText>
<bot>No, only ordinary.<endOfText>
<human>And what were they?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, we used to work from eight to half-past five and then from eight to half-past twelve, fifty-two and half hours, when I started first.<endOfText>
<human>But er you know it come down to forty-six and usually only do about thirty-eight now that is, sommat like and er it's only half a week.<endOfText>
<bot>But when I started it was fifty-two and a half hours a week  yes.<endOfText>
<human>And er the half hour was er  erm we had nine and a half five days, that was er  from eight till half past five  I don't know but it was fifty-two and a half hours, from eight till half-past twelve on a Saturday and er<endOfText>
<bot>Did, did you get breaks during the day?<endOfText>
<human>Were did you  <endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes <endOfText>
<human>You did.<endOfText>
<bot>You always er <endOfText>
<human>About half past twelve  <endOfText>
<bot>You always had a I had a dinner-time, half-past twelve to half-past one, every day and er you was allowed to have a cup of tea.<endOfText>
<human>As a matter of fact, a lot of the firms provided the cup of teas, you could go and get one, you know what I mean.<endOfText>
<bot>I think at that time you had to pay for it, but you could go and have ten minutes, sommat like that, and a cup of tea.<endOfText>
<human>It weren't er  just all  you know, there was a certain amount of er thought attached to it and as I say, the  people was er  accepted by the gaffers and er respected, you know what I mean.<endOfText>
<bot>But there was always them as just wanted to come and do nothing and pick the money up and that's what they had to sort out the firms.<endOfText>
<human>And I, I don't think that's changed now, do you?<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think it's changed but that has applied all the while, my lad.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes and er  if I might s oh I er don't know  I've been to bloody shop meself  but I ain't sorry about it, cos I've done what I've wanted to do and I've enjoyed what I've done and erm  the authorities they get'd me that on er hardship grounds there, as I say, being on er residential premise and er they showed me great respect and er <endOfText>
<human>Too old to travel on  that's why they <endOfText>
<bot>the local council, who, who, I wo, I call it used me but not in er whatsit sense, er it's helped, you know it's, it's helped them and er whatever, it's become well-known if I might say so, in locks, I'll go to Dick <endOfText>
<human>Were, were there a lot of erm sort of small workshops like yours, a few years ago when you <endOfText>
<bot>There were <endOfText>
<human>started up?<endOfText>
<bot>There were  <endOfText>
<human>There were.<endOfText>
<bot>As a matter of fact, when I'm talking about, let me see er fifty years ago, there was one up at every back yard, that's the truth.<endOfText>
<human>And er   used to go.<endOfText>
<bot>I'd got one  didn't I, that's right.<endOfText>
<human>But erm <endOfText>
<bot>What, why why do you think they, why do you think they've gone, so many of them?<endOfText>
<human>Why do you think they've disappeared?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, er the reason was erm technique and science and they'd, they  all the firms or who was in business had to make locks their own way, you know what I mean and use the best facilities they could get hold of, but science and progress came into being and they cou they made what you could call locks erm  repetition.<endOfText>
<human>Er they had a lock, made it a good lock and sent it to all the clients and this is what we can supply, and it used to meet the needs of clients and they'd er they'd erm buy it and it kept them in business, you see what I mean?<endOfText>
<bot>And then other firms did that and er they was the same people nearly, got their own lines and it was worse that was, so they got onto the same lines and er the competition became then financial <endOfText>
<human>There used to be  nearly every <endOfText>
<bot>I say the competition then, later on became financial.<endOfText>
<human>Them as who could make it a bit cheaper see, and all that.<endOfText>
<bot>But  you said erm certain things could be  we had, had a machine once and you'd got to pull four or five handles.<endOfText>
<human>When you had pulled five handles there was an article produced.<endOfText>
<bot>each, each time you pulled a handle it did one job and er couldn't tell you really now what it was, you know but er you'd pull the five handles in a few minutes and the damn thing was done.<endOfText>
<human>And er  another way'd cost ten times as much and that to produce.<endOfText>
<bot>Did, did you see much machinery being brought in while you were at ?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>As a matter of fact, that what they were lacking in and we er we had a driller and er  we had a driller and er horizontal lather for turning and a grinder, when I say grinder I mean emery wheel, and that's about all we'd got in the shop.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but it was old-fashioned wasn't it <endOfText>
<bot>So it was all ha hand work was it?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes it was, yes it was.<endOfText>
<human>When you went to the driller you'd gotta hold it in your hand or get a sommat, a gadget to hold the thing on, pull  put the drill in.<endOfText>
<bot>When you had got to go to the emery wheel, you'd gotta hold the things and emery wheel them and  yourself.<endOfText>
<human>And er <endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes, it was very old-fashioned  <endOfText>
<human>when you wanted to do something with the keys or operate er horizontal, there was a machine and you had to go to the do it yourself.<endOfText>
<bot>And each man, or perhaps been one or two men doing the one jo the one order and they was each responsible for their own and then  you'd gotta put your name down sometimes for a machine you know.<endOfText>
<human>I'm on next, you know what I mean and er oh ah, old-fashioned time, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But it, it was a, it was a good place to work you think?<endOfText>
<human>Oh I shall never regret  Er I don't know but  I'm just perhaps one on me own, but er it couldn't have been better for because I was a freelance and er I wanted to learn and wanted to get on and they allowed me, they allowed me to do what I wanted.<endOfText>
<bot>I was very, very happy.<endOfText>
<human>Never ever had half as much wage as I really should've had and I say to  that's never bothered me.<endOfText>
<bot>I've never ever  I say this very proudly, been in debt and as long as I've earned enough money to live, I've never bothered to put any on one side strict, you know, strictly speaking and I've been happy to er live and er that's how I've lived me life.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that's that, yep.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>But in the first instance, as I say we, I was one of six children and er I don't think there was one working while they was, I mean they was all born before there was anybody old enough to work, you find, that's  And our Albert, me dad had Albert up and he er never give me mother any wages for Albert.<endOfText>
<human>He used to give Albert some pocket money  and he was satisfied, but me mother wasn't.<endOfText>
<bot>And I said to me mother, I says look here, when I'm old enough to work I say's, I ain't going to work for me dad I shall get a job on me own.<endOfText>
<human>I says he ain't doing on me what he's doing on Albert.<endOfText>
<bot>I says I sure of that and er I left and went and got into a row over it.<endOfText>
<human>But I went down Harold  I tell you and got the job.<endOfText>
<bot>I couldn't have gone to a better place because they'd got  most parts of the country and one thing and another and I fitted their bill to a tee.<endOfText>
<human>And they called me more or less er to do the odd jobs you know and in the brew house, as was here, I fixed, I told you once, I fixed a bench up, it was as tight as could be and put a vice on it and all  in here, this shop here, they says you can come in here anytime and do what you like and er <endOfText>
<bot>some friends  at  here, they er was in the woods line and er the gaffer, Ernie, we went through Little London School together, and he says anything we can do, anytime Richard, you've only gotta say.<endOfText>
<human>So I could always go up there and I used there little drill  for one thing and another in the first place and er  built that premise for me there   did and I did er<endOfText>
<bot>in the shop and<endOfText>
<human>He used to go to a lotta places er that as knocked down or, well I couldn't tell you the kind of job, but often there was some locks on the premises was er, perhaps needed repair or he wanted them to be in  before he could leave the job and say here you are, that's the job done.<endOfText>
<bot>And he used to bring anything and everything, and that's not joking, to me and er I'm proud of that.<endOfText>
<human>I was able to accommodate him at each time, you follow what I mean.<endOfText>
<bot>I'd make it me business to er yes and course it was to his trade good  jobs as he'd  done for customers, had it done so well, they told somebody else and it brought in trade, see what I mean?<endOfText>
<human>When, when you were working up the shop up the back erm where, where were you getting your, your su supplies from, I mean like, were you, were you buying castings, did you need to buy  <endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes erm er  I er  I had er  what was the  what is it those in the  you know <endOfText>
<human>You used to have a casting  <endOfText>
<bot>Aye <endOfText>
<human>and er<endOfText>
<bot>er<endOfText>
<human>Dennis <endOfText>
<bot>Dennis  and Sammy er<endOfText>
<human>Sammy  and er <endOfText>
<bot>You used to have your castings from there and then you have them off Ernie <endOfText>
<human>They, I had them of Ernie  oh that's er that's a good girl  Shilling a pound, brass castings.<endOfText>
<bot>Now brass is a pound in, in weight now never mind about shilling a pound.<endOfText>
<human>Ernie <endOfText>
<bot>Ernie  house <endOfText>
<human>the top of er  there was somebody named  was sold coal <endOfText>
<bot>right on the corner by the, I believe the  <endOfText>
<human>There was a Post Office on the corner opposite the Post Office chapel, Post er opposite the Baptist chapel and er up the back yard there, there was this premise, it was behind a pub called the Beehive and erm I rented it out there and er that was nextdoor to  and the castings was a shilling a pound and er<endOfText>
<bot>They'd do, they'd do special one-off things for your would they?<endOfText>
<human>Yes er that's been the essence of what I've wanted is er I've, I've had to have what I've wanted by hook or by crook, and I don't mean crook in a bad sense, I mean one way or another, you know what I mean and er I did job for the casters, same as they did jobs for me, you know and that's how I've gone through life, that is Michael.<endOfText>
<bot>Helping one another and<endOfText>
<human>Three brass casters there?<endOfText>
<bot>You had three brass casters there.<endOfText>
<human>Had Dennis <endOfText>
<bot>And er <endOfText>
<human>Ernie <endOfText>
<bot>You see<endOfText>
<human>And then were <endOfText>
<bot>I could perhaps take a little bit of paper like that and I'd find <endOfText>
<human>But they were all local weren't they, anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>I'd find <endOfText>
<human>Oh yes.<endOfText>
<bot>I'd find something as er pretty near to what I wanted, you know and I could perhaps, and did, use what's called beeswax a lot, you know and er warm it up and ply it and put it onto er something to make it to what the shape I wanted, you know.<endOfText>
<human>So you made, you made your own patterns  <endOfText>
<bot>And then the caster'd cast that, you know and another ca time, I wanted er a projection, you know and er I'd take a casting.<endOfText>
<human>Cos they used to have gates with er two or three inches apart, you know and I'd gotta have a projection.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I could go to the casting and asked him to put the pattern in and fire it for it, to cut the sand out like that, you know so that the metal'd run in like that and you'd got the big head as you wanted, you know and er it'd take you  like castings  with the machine and all that sort of thing, it was all hand stuff you know and yeah<endOfText>
<human>They'd they'd have to be filed before you used them, would they?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh I could go, used to get them on the emery wheel and er square them up with a pair of sliding gages.<endOfText>
<human>Michael, I've had to work very, very exact my lad  and these things I'd got the sliding gages and put them on and they'd been the same at the front as they have at the back and that's the thickness as well.<endOfText>
<bot>And when you've er loose them in the fore end or the front of the lock or do anything like that  that article as it's in, when you lock it out it's gotta fit just as tight when it's locked out as when it's in.<endOfText>
<human>Which means it's gotta be exact all the way round, you know what I mean.<endOfText>
<bot>And these are all part of er  <endOfText>
<human>and have it trimmed up and then you can <endOfText>
<bot>That's what I used to do <endOfText>
<human>they'd gotta be as I couldn't go to them <endOfText>
<bot>No<endOfText>
<human>How, how did you learn to, I mean, looking at some of your locks, they're sort of very, very fine<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah<endOfText>
<human>I mean did you, did you learn this as you went on or did you, did you <endOfText>
<bot>No it was er it was er  oh how can I say er I used me head and er, if you follow what I mean, and imagination and er I could envisage what, perhaps, people wanted, it was in my own mind and I'd make it up  some way or another.<endOfText>
<human>You could call ingenuity if you like and er but it've, did apply my lad and er once you'd got one, you could have er one cast and dress it up and you'd got another one, you know what I mean.<endOfText>
<bot>You make a thing as is gonna do the job and it's no problem then to get castings off it and all that sort of thing.<endOfText>
<human>But in, in a lot of instances, to answer you, I had to use me ingenuity.<endOfText>
<bot>What I want and er how to get it.<endOfText>
<human>I couldn't tell you how, but it I, cos  you'd, I don't want nothing, but when I did, I'd gotta use my ingenuity to get something that I could get one or two or a dozen or ten off, you know what I mean, and I gotta make it and a lot of times I made it out of wood  which was easily er  you know treated.<endOfText>
<bot>Then you could get a, a piece of wood very, very rough, understand me and then  cast and then you could get the cast in down to exaction, you follow what I mean and then er you could what you want.<endOfText>
<human>But I started off wood, nearly, nearly in every instance.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos they used to send me er l er orders, locks on drawings and six, six or sev six or seven pages and that's all I'd got to go in, see what I mean?<endOfText>
<human>Well I'd start with wood and er get something rough to work off and then, use me head as I say, get it down to the requirements on the, on the paper and then start to produce eventually, you know and er<endOfText>
<bot>You used to have your keys off  <endOfText>
<human>Eh?<endOfText>
<bot>You used to have your keys off <endOfText>
<human>Yes, Arthur  <endOfText>
<bot>Oh I know  <endOfText>
<human>Arthur  in Eddington <endOfText>
<bot>Yes, yes <endOfText>
<human>They're one of the keys, best keys men in, a friend of mine.<endOfText>
<bot>He was a, we belonged to the same shed.<endOfText>
<human>He used to come to  and I was a member of Springbank for sixty years and er anything I can do Richard, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>And I used to go up there and tell him what I wanted and as far as keys and anything like that, got sent to me he would.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, Horace, he's he was in the paper a short while ago, eighty-two were it?<endOfText>
<bot>Horace Evans?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I think so.<endOfText>
<bot>You know and he's eighty-two now and er that makes him about five year older than me but to tw I'm talking about twenty, thirty year ago, five  make no difference then, you know and we ha had the same understanding.<endOfText>
<human>He knew as he could come to me er he used to bring me lock keys of all sorts and er he could get the castings or the patterns or what it is like that and he knows I could fashion them to fit the lock and all that sort of thin and we were very  <endOfText>
<bot>So you'd, they, they they gave, they sent you the blanks, did they, and you'd work them up?<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes, oh yes yes erm  and I'm on about er   on about, for one thing, but you'd be surprised er it's the biggest and most elaborate trade of any in the world, locks and keys, I say that very firmly because er  there's no limit, there's no extent and you, there might be required anything and as I say er I er  I had these locks for the asylums and that, you know and er I thought I mentioned it before, I made fifty  fifty locks all different and I had to number them and keep a record of them and er  I had a, you had the keys on a wire, numbered one up to fifty and they was for big, big asylums, you know what I mean and er they could go in one ward, I'm on about places where they'd have twenty or thirty people, you know and er there's only one bloke could get in there.<endOfText>
<bot>Be a different master key for the next ward and all that sort of thing.<endOfText>
<human>There was fifty and there was five levers and three lifts and I had to get a piece of paper and er make a, when you get one, two, three and then five you could have er three, three, two, one and five, four, three, two, one, you know what I mean?<endOfText>
<bot>Then I could have two, a one, three and four three, two, one, five, do you know what I mean?<endOfText>
<human>And I had to make all these er computations out and er  I made fifty  that I thought nobody could pick.<endOfText>
<bot>There was no  Michael, it's just only way,co mind you could only do these on one-sided because when you turn your key the other side, it's gotta be th exactly the same to do the job.<endOfText>
<human>But this was because it was one-sided, they used to lock it from the outside and there was a catch on the inside as they could put in.<endOfText>
<bot>They only used to ever lock the door from the outside and er I er  had to make er fifty and as I say, number them one up to fifty and er then they'd perhaps  on a odd occasion they sent me an order for one, the number  the number <endOfText>
<human>and then, then your metal you used to have to  hadn't you?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, yes  yes  and er but erm that was one of the most famous in my opinion.<endOfText>
<human>It was only a one-sided lock, which is completely and totally different to an ordinary lock er working both sides, you see what I mean and er  I er I'd got to er make a key, number thirty-nine  just like that, see but I had it and I could find out what thirty-nine was and I could make them one and send it and knowing it would fit see and er when they had different people working there, you know staff, things like that, not a lot of orders but er somebody else come.<endOfText>
<bot>They might want him or her to have a key, you know and er and just ran the keys up on a thing like that, you know what I mean, they was never out of the person's possession.<endOfText>
<human>It wasn't er, it wasn't good to leave them about, you know what I mean and er oh er  yes it's been very important, if I might say so, certain things as I've had been called upon to do and I've been happy and proud to do it.<endOfText>
<bot>When, when you were working at  were  were, were, the union important at all, the, the Lock, Lock-making union?<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes, I've al I was always in the union.<endOfText>
<bot>As a matter of fact er yes I, I, I joined at sixteen on the union, when I was a, a kid and er I've always believed in it and I encourage others to do the same.<endOfText>
<human>And when I er  went to go on me own er  I still wanted to keep in the union and I went down the Locksmiths' union, which was in the market place, and they said they er we couldn't, we couldn't have you in the union if you go on your own erm there's another denomination or something, was something that you'd have to join or something like that and be on your own.<endOfText>
<bot>Well er when I er, when I er, I couldn't remember much what it was now, but whatever the union fee was, when I started on me own to be er satisfied of cos of circumstances I might need money, you know, I thought it would say the union fee was a shilling, I had to pay one and six  half as much as whatever it was and I did do.<endOfText>
<human>Never ever been out of a union er till I retired cos I always paid these fees and er  yes.<endOfText>
<bot>You, you always felt it was er, an important thing to belong?<endOfText>
<human>Well er I didn't want to be out of it or, awkward or off it or anything, if it was right, and I felt that it was right, I'd adhere to that, whether or not, you follow what I mean, that's how I've lived me life, Michael, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Was, was Mr  at the union in those days?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, oh yes.<endOfText>
<bot>You see until er er he lived in  er you're on a about fifty or sixty years ago you know  yes.<endOfText>
<human>I  we live in  then, then up to Wellington, but he lived in  you know and er <endOfText>
<bot>Were, were there any times when the union was, when the union was quite important?<endOfText>
<human>When, when they helped to solve a problem at, at  Can you remember any instance?<endOfText>
<bot>Well er  as I say, I've always been a union member but then when I was self-employed it was different and I kept me fees up for a, to somewhere I don't know what it was, but er when er  yes, when er I was coming to come on me own and I went down the locksmith's to see about it and they said er, what did they say now, they said you couldn't do that, whatever it was, and er we'll have to do this and that and the other.<endOfText>
<human>And I er I had to er see a solicitor or something.<endOfText>
<bot>Not er to pay but a bloke with knowledge to ask him what was my rights, you know and all that sort of thing.<endOfText>
<human>Changing from making locks.<endOfText>
<bot>Changing from being employed to being self-employed, it's, it's a big change that is you and er, and er the union  the union helped me and er told me what I could do and what I couldn't do and all that sort of thing.<endOfText>
<human>I had to pay some money, I just forget now, very little but er as I've said half a dozen times now, I always wanted to do what was right, you know, and I aim to do that.<endOfText>
<bot>That's how I've er that's how I've gone through life, my lad, that is.<endOfText>
<human><endOfText>
<bot>To be absolutely, strictly theological  in fact, William Booth made a little mistake in the song  because God will never ever send another pentecost.<endOfText>
<human>It was a once off thing.<endOfText>
<bot>And, in our English language we actually make this mistake  when we talk about birthdays  French, in some ways are for more sensible with language, and you only ever have one birthday, the rest of them are anniversaries of your birthday.<endOfText>
<human>And God has only ever, and only ever will send one pentecost, and that took place on the day of pentecost, the birthday, the birth of the church.<endOfText>
<bot>There are, as we've been reminded, we celebrate that again today, an anniversary.<endOfText>
<human>I've gotta confess, I don't like th the expression Whitsun so much, I prefer, er the expression, what it really is, it is pentecost.<endOfText>
<bot>And literally it means just fifty.<endOfText>
<human>That what it means, and it was fifty days se se se seven weeks, after the death and resurrection of Jesus  and the disciples had been told to wait in an upper room until the Holy Spirit would descend upon them, and you've had that record read to you from acts chapter two of just what took place on that day, that birth day of the church of Jesus Christ.<endOfText>
<bot>Course, it didn't end there.<endOfText>
<human>Birthdays are beginnings not endings.<endOfText>
<bot>And, the early church grew from there.<endOfText>
<human>And that experience that took place on that initial day that is the birthday of the church was not just a one off thing, but as others came into the church they experienced not another pentecost, but if you like, their own pentecost.<endOfText>
<bot>And  we're gonna look at a passage in just a few moments in, it's in the eighth chapter of acts  where a group of people there, they were Samaritans  how they came in to experience their pentecost.<endOfText>
<human>But you know, for every one of us as Christians, Jesus Christ lives in us by the Holy Spirit, by his spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>Jesus Christ, when he er, went back to heaven he went back as a  fe , as a glorified, but as a physical being.<endOfText>
<human>That is why, the physical resurrection of Jesus is so important.<endOfText>
<bot>There is a man in the glory.<endOfText>
<human>There is a man seated on the right hand of God the Father, there interceding for you and for me.<endOfText>
<bot>It's not his spirit that's doing it, it is the same person that the disciples spoke to when they walked the streets of Palestine, it is the same person that went around healing the sick, it is the same person that was born in the, in the manger at Bethlehem, he is now, after having died, been raised again by the power of the trying God had, he is now ascended back into heaven, in glorified form, and he is there interceding, representing you and me before his father there in heaven.<endOfText>
<human>He is there in that local situation.<endOfText>
<bot>And just the same as when Jesus was here on earth he was in one place, he he confined himself to a body.<endOfText>
<human>And he is there now in the glory, but yet we say, we invite Jesus into our heart, and he walks, and we sing the song from the, he walks and he talks, how is it that this happens if Jesus is there in heaven?<endOfText>
<bot>Well it happens, and it's made possible because he does it by his spirit.<endOfText>
<human>Now there aren't two spirits, there's not the spirit of Christ, and the Holy spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>There's not a multitude of spirits.<endOfText>
<human>God is a spirit!<endOfText>
<bot>And he is the mystery of the trinity.<endOfText>
<human>God the Father, who is also spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>God the son, who is also spirit.<endOfText>
<human>And God the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>And so, Jesus Christ indwells your life as a Christian, and he indwells my life as a Christian by his spirit, by the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>We are born again by the spirit of God.<endOfText>
<bot>We become Christians through the work of the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>But the New Testament teaches us, that apart from that new birth by the spirit, and that indwelling of Jesus Christ in our lives by the spirit, there is a subsequent experience that is called receiving or being baptized as a Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>We're gonna look at this little passage in in acts eight, which shows to us that these Samaritan chri , they were saved!<endOfText>
<human>They had accepted Jesus Christ as their, as their saviour, they had been born again.<endOfText>
<bot>They were Christians.<endOfText>
<human>They had been baptized.<endOfText>
<bot>And yet, there was something missing in their experience.<endOfText>
<human>Let me read a few verses, reading first of all from verse twelve  it says,that when they believed Philip preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized men and women alike.<endOfText>
<bot>And even Simon himself believed.<endOfText>
<human>And after being baptized he continued on with Philip, as he observed signs and great miracles taking place, and he was constantly amazed!<endOfText>
<bot>This fellow Simon, you read about him in a few verses earlier, he was a, he was a magician, a so , er a sorcerer, he was the, the wi the witch doctor if you like, if he was in i i in an African situation, there he was, he was the medicine man of the town, of the area  and he too believed and was converted, he was baptized, and he was amazed at the miracles that he'd seen being performed  by Philip through the power of God.<endOfText>
<human>He was a man who was used to the supernatural  but he was amazed at the things that he saw!<endOfText>
<bot>And it says, now when the apostles, who were in Jerusalem heard that Somaria had received the word of God they sent them Peter and John, who came down and prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>For he had not yet fallen on upon any of them.<endOfText>
<bot>They had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.<endOfText>
<human>They they began laying their hands on them and they were receiving the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>Now when Simon saw that the spirit was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles hands, he offered them much money, saying, give this authority to me as well, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>But Peter said to him, may your silver perish with you because you thought you could obtain the gift of God without mo , with money!<endOfText>
<bot>You have no part or portion in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.<endOfText>
<human>Therefore, repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray the Lord that if possible the intention of your heart may be forgiven you<endOfText>
<bot>for I see that you are in the gaol of bitterness and in the bondage of inequity.<endOfText>
<human>Simon answered and said, pray to the Lord for me yourselves to that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.<endOfText>
<bot>Philip, who was an evangelist, he had gone down to Somaria, in fact, the Holy Spirit had taken him there.<endOfText>
<human>If you read a few er, verses, a chapter or so earlier on, he had been speaking to one man to a er er  a high official from Ethiopia, and he had been sharing with him from Isaiah chapter fifty three, the message of Jesus Christ.<endOfText>
<bot>This Ethiopian, he had come to Jerusalem, he was a, he was a a,go , a Godly man, he was seeking after the things of God, and he had come to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage to worship God, and he was returning home, and he had got hold of the scroll that had Isaiah fifty three in it, and he was reading it, and Philip goes up to the man in the chariot, he said, do you understand what you're reading?<endOfText>
<human>The man says, how can I except somebody explain to me?<endOfText>
<bot>And Philip, it says there, he says and er er,, he preached unto him Jesus  showing him that Isaiah fifty three referred to Jesus Christ.<endOfText>
<human>And the man was er, accepted Christ as his saviour and they went down and Philip baptized in there, in in in the river.<endOfText>
<bot>And, as they come out of the water the fa , the bible says the spirit takes Philip away and  he goes down now to to so to Somaria  and and he starts preaching there in Somaria  a and there's this tremendous  result!<endOfText>
<human>He sees miracles taking place!<endOfText>
<bot>Many folk coming to know Jesus Christ the saviour.<endOfText>
<human>It says, there was great joy in all the city!<endOfText>
<bot>And yet, there was still something missing.<endOfText>
<human>And word gets back  to apostles in Jerusalem.<endOfText>
<bot>They had heard about the blessing there, they had heard about the healing, the deliverance, the joy, yet nobody had received the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>They'd been baptized in water as we've already read, and yet nobody had received the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, as we've said earlier on the Holy Spirit works in the new birth  and it is through the work of the Holy Spirit that we come to know God.<endOfText>
<human>That we are born again.<endOfText>
<bot>That we become Christians.<endOfText>
<human>Jesus, shortly before he left his disciples he tells them, it's in Mark chapter sixteen, er yes, Mark chapter sixteen, in verse seventeen, it says,these signs will accompany those who have believed in my name.<endOfText>
<bot>They will cast out demons, they will speak with new tongues.<endOfText>
<human>We are born again of God's Holy Spirit .<endOfText>
<bot>This is something that God does in in the verses earlier, Jesus says go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation, he who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved!<endOfText>
<human>It's the work of God's spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>The result of the preaching of the gospel, men and women respond and are born again.<endOfText>
<human>They become followers of Jesus.<endOfText>
<bot>So the Holy Spirit works, in our lives to bring us to Christ, to bring us to new birth.<endOfText>
<human>To bring us to become Christians.<endOfText>
<bot>Then there is this subsequent experience which follows  receiving or being filled with the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>Peter tells in his first apistle in chapter one, in verse twenty three, for you have been born again, not of seed which is perishable, but imperishable, that is through the living and abiding word of God.<endOfText>
<bot>So the Holy Spirit is at work.<endOfText>
<human>And God's word is used in bringing us to new birth, in bringing us, er to faith in Jesus Christ.<endOfText>
<bot>And this is what happened here in Somaria.<endOfText>
<human>In verse fourteen it says,when the apostles in Jerusalem that Somaria had received the word of God   and we cannot become Christians without God's word.<endOfText>
<bot>It is his word  that makes us aware of our condition.<endOfText>
<human>That we are sinners.<endOfText>
<bot>It is his word that makes us aware that Jesus Christ came and died for us, that God loves us.<endOfText>
<human>How shall they hear, the bible says, without a preacher?<endOfText>
<bot>How will they, how will folk hear?<endOfText>
<human>How will they come to faith without the word of God?<endOfText>
<bot>Faith comes by hearing  and hearing the word of God.<endOfText>
<human>So when they hear this, the apostles back in  Jerusalem, they send Peter and John down to Somaria for this special purpose  that they might pray for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>Now why, why couldn't Philip have prayed for the people?<endOfText>
<human>He had brought them to faith in Jesus Christ.<endOfText>
<bot>He had preached the gospel.<endOfText>
<human>God had, through him, performed miracles!<endOfText>
<bot>Amazing miracles and signs and wonders!<endOfText>
<human>Why couldn't Philip pray for them?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, of course, there's a sense in which he could easily have prayed for them, but at that moment, in that particular place, that was not God's purpose.<endOfText>
<human>And this is sometimes where we get a little bit, you know, hung up,a a and and when we tend to make a little bit, we make mistakes a lot.<endOfText>
<bot>We have got to allow God to do his work in his way and in his time.<endOfText>
<human>And in God's plan at this particular moment  i this was not Philip's function, it wasn't his job.<endOfText>
<bot>He had fulfilled, he had discharged his mission, he had preached the gospel  he had seen men and women coming to Jesus Christ, he had seen the mi mi miracles happening  he had baptized those who have put faith in Jesus, and now, you see, it's not a one man show, there was, there was a leadersh , there was a team involved here.<endOfText>
<human>The apostles come down.<endOfText>
<bot>Not because Philip was unable to do it, not because he was incapable of doing it, but here is God's purpose, of ma , of people working together in bringing about his will and his purposes.<endOfText>
<human>We've all, we've gotta remember this, that every one of us, we have a place in God's will and plan  and whilst we are in that place  everything is  good   well there's, there's still problems of course, there are still difficulties, there are still heartaches, but things are working right.<endOfText>
<bot>The machinery is working correctly.<endOfText>
<human>But once we try to operate outside of that place, and we try to do somebody else's job, we try to fulfil somebody else's function, then we are in trouble!<endOfText>
<bot>Then the thing is out of gear.<endOfText>
<human>Then the gears start crashing.<endOfText>
<bot>There's not that smooth synchronized  er  way of going on which God purposes, and in , and intends.<endOfText>
<human>You see God is th ,i i is a God of order  he's not a God of disorder, it's not a case of anybody doing what they like, he works according to his pattern.<endOfText>
<bot>And who are you and I to tell God what his purpose is, and his pattern's gonna be?<endOfText>
<human>He is sovereign  and he will work according to his will.<endOfText>
<bot>And he's used Philip  and now he i ,i i in his purpose he brings down Peter a a and John  to to, to have their part i in his will and his purpose at this time.<endOfText>
<human>We do not all have the same ministries.<endOfText>
<bot>We do not all have the same function within the body of Christ.<endOfText>
<human>And later on the apostle Paul, he elaborates on this, and he uses the picture of an ordinary body, and he says every member's not the same.<endOfText>
<bot>We're not a, our our physical body's not made up of a multitude of hands  or a multitude of feet  there are feet, and the feet has one function, the hand has another.<endOfText>
<human>We don't hear with our hands!<endOfText>
<bot>We hear with our ears!<endOfText>
<human>And every part of that body has a function.<endOfText>
<bot>And the body is working well and fine when every part is doing their function.<endOfText>
<human>Now, at a pinch, I might be able to walk a step or two on my hands with my feet in the air, believe me, it's not a pretty sight!<endOfText>
<bot>And I won't get very far.<endOfText>
<human>And even if I, how far I get it won't be quick  because, God didn't give me hands to walk on, he gave me feet to walk on.<endOfText>
<bot>And so, the body works better when each part is doing it's particular function.<endOfText>
<human>And this isn't just true of course, of our physical body, it's true of his body, the church.<endOfText>
<bot>And oh, when we do something else, and my hands say to my feet,ha hang on, you can walk as well as they can, let's try it.<endOfText>
<human>They can't!<endOfText>
<bot>And there's cra , there's chaos!<endOfText>
<human>There's trouble!<endOfText>
<bot>And so it is within the body.<endOfText>
<human>When I say, I can do it as well as he can do it, I can do that!<endOfText>
<bot>God says no, hang on, you're supposed to be doing this.<endOfText>
<human>And it's only as we fulfil our function with the body.<endOfText>
<bot>That's why it's so important to kno , for everyone of us, to know what our ministries are.<endOfText>
<human>That we might be, not frustrated, you know, frustration is because, I'm not able to do what I should be doing.<endOfText>
<bot>And oh, the frustration that can build up in our lives as Christians because we are not where we should be or doing what God purposes for us!<endOfText>
<human>We do not then all have the same ministries.<endOfText>
<bot>And so, Peter, and John, they come down to Somaria.<endOfText>
<human>And when Simon, they they laid their hands on the folk and God in his graciousness pours out his spirit and they receive the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>Now when Simon saw was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles hands, he offered them money saying, give this authority to me as well so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>Simon was not trying to buy the Holy Spirit  but rather the ability to impart the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>There's a sense in which  it might sound rather strange, I think Simon was  there was something in this guy that is attractive I think.<endOfText>
<human>He he's already opened hi up his heart to the Lord, there's a lot that he's gotta learn, there's a lot he's gotta let go of, there's a lot of his old life still there, but isn't that true of every one us?<endOfText>
<bot>It doesn't all disappear over night.<endOfText>
<human>We grow in grace, we grow as we learn what God teaches us.<endOfText>
<bot>And we're all at different stages in our pilgrimage.<endOfText>
<human>And so, Simon he  he wants what the apostles have got.<endOfText>
<bot>If only I could  he he looks back on his life and he knows the power that he has experienced.<endOfText>
<human>He knows the authority that he's had in that community, he has seen supernatural things happening in his life and through him, albeit, they were not of God, but has been involved in supernatural things.<endOfText>
<bot>And he sees something now that to him is mind blowing!<endOfText>
<human>He's never seen anything like this before!<endOfText>
<bot>He has already been constantly amazed at what has taken place through Philip!<endOfText>
<human>And now, with Peter and John, this is just the end as far as he's concerned.<endOfText>
<bot>He said, oh if only I had that power!<endOfText>
<human>If only if I had that ability!<endOfText>
<bot>Can I acquire it?<endOfText>
<human>Can I have it?<endOfText>
<bot>And he offers them money.<endOfText>
<human>He doesn't realize that you can't buy it.<endOfText>
<bot>He doesn't realize that it's not up for sale.<endOfText>
<human>But oh, if I might have this ability to impart the Holy Spirit!<endOfText>
<bot>But he's made this carbon thing you see, it wasn't for the  the apostles couldn't it!<endOfText>
<human>Peter and John couldn't do it!<endOfText>
<bot>In the New Testament there are four different words that are used to refer to a gift  and the one used here means an endowment, and an endowment comes, not because of me, but it becomes because of the grace of the giver.<endOfText>
<human>I don't merit it.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't, I haven't worked for it.<endOfText>
<human>I've done nothing worthy of receiving it.<endOfText>
<bot>It is the grace of the giver!<endOfText>
<human>And the Holy Spirit, God's gracious gift to us.<endOfText>
<bot>Just like salvation, is not because we merit it.<endOfText>
<human>We don't merit it!<endOfText>
<bot>We haven't worked for it!<endOfText>
<human>We can't acquire it by any other means other than receiving the gift as God the gracious giver makes it available.<endOfText>
<bot>Wanna say a bit more about that a little later on.<endOfText>
<human>Now, these er, Samaritans, they received the Holy Spirit, now  how do we know that the Samaritans actually spoke in tongues?<endOfText>
<bot>Because it doesn't tell you that here.<endOfText>
<human>It doesn't say so.<endOfText>
<bot>But it, certainly as you read through the New Testament, the acts of the apostles, it certainly is the norm for those who received the Holy Spirit, that they spoke in other tongues.<endOfText>
<human>And we've already read that verse from Mark's gospel, where it says quite, Jesus himself says quite clearly that those, these signs will accompany those who believe in my , they will speak with new, with new tongues.<endOfText>
<bot>And wherever you read of this experience happening, again, and again, you read of the folk there receiving the Holy Spirit, and speaking in in other tongues.<endOfText>
<human>In speaking a language they have not learned.<endOfText>
<bot>It wasn't just on the day of pentecost.<endOfText>
<human>And it seems that this is the norm  and there comes a time when you don't always mention the norm, you don't underline it every time, you don't refer to it every time because it is the excepted thing.<endOfText>
<bot>It is the normal practice.<endOfText>
<human>And everybody was aware that this was the norm, and so you accept it and take it for granted.<endOfText>
<bot>It is however, mentioned in most incidences, in the New Testament.<endOfText>
<human>But if they didn't speak with tongues  how did Simon know that they had received the Holy Spirit?<endOfText>
<bot>It wasn't because their faces suddenly lit up.<endOfText>
<human>It wasn't because there was some weird expression that had come over them.<endOfText>
<bot>How on earth did he know?<endOfText>
<human>And the only record that we have in scripture of any evidence of folk having received the Holy Spirit was that they spoke with other tongues.<endOfText>
<bot>There certainly was some evidence.<endOfText>
<human>When Simon saw that the spirit was bestowed to the laying on of the apostles hands  it wasn't just something he conjured up in his imagination.<endOfText>
<bot>There was some evidence for it.<endOfText>
<human>There was something that with one of his sense that he could recognize.<endOfText>
<bot>There was a physical sign.<endOfText>
<human>And yet, in the New Testament there is no other sign given.<endOfText>
<bot>There is no other physical manifestation given  of the Holy, of the o , baptism of the Holy Spirit, other than that of speaking in other tongues.<endOfText>
<human>You see, it wasn't their joy, it wasn't just because they were exuberant, they had already i di , expressed this joy back in verse eight, at the preaching of the gospel, there was much rejoicing in the city!<endOfText>
<bot>There was great joy in the city!<endOfText>
<human>So it wasn't just the joy, he was used to that, this was something over and above that.<endOfText>
<bot>And certainly, as you read through the New Testament and the  in both the acts of the apostles and the apistles, the apistles of Paul in particular, speaking in tongues  goes hand in hand with receiving the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>Now, speaking in tongues is not the Holy Spirit  and the Holy Spirit is not speaking with other tongues, but they go together.<endOfText>
<bot>It's an evidence.<endOfText>
<human>You know, it's a little bit like a a car log book, or a registration doc document as they're called now.<endOfText>
<bot>The log book, the registration document is not the car, but it is evidence of the ownership of the car.<endOfText>
<human>I've got the registration document because the car belongs to me.<endOfText>
<bot>I can't drive the document around.<endOfText>
<human>And sometimes we make that mistake  as though speaking in tongues was the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>It is but an evidence of the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>It is one of his gifts.<endOfText>
<bot>One of his ministries, one of his many, many ministries, but it is one of his ministries.<endOfText>
<human>And if we've been filled with the Holy Spirit, then we should have the evidence to go with it.<endOfText>
<bot>There should be the  the aca station if you like, there should be the documentation, and it certainly seems in the New Testament that that is speaking with other tongues, it's not the only thing of course.<endOfText>
<human>You see, it's not just speaking in other tongues, there is gonna become the evidence of it as well as we grow in him.<endOfText>
<bot>Notice also, that there is no evidence or suggestion that they had to wait  for th for this baptism, for this infilling of the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>It is God's free gift to all.<endOfText>
<bot>That is why I I I mentioned those mar , those remarks right at the beginning, God will never ever send another pentecost, the only people that God told to wait were those early disciples to wait in Jerusalem until the Holy Spirit came and they had to wait for ten days from the ascension of Jesus until the Holy Spirit came.<endOfText>
<human>There is no suggestion anywhere else in the New Testament of waiting for the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>He has already been given!<endOfText>
<human>God is not gonna give the Holy Spirit again.<endOfText>
<bot>He has given him, and he has never withdrawn him!<endOfText>
<human>And so it's not a case of our waiting  it's rather a case of our receiving.<endOfText>
<bot>You see  if I was to say to you, right well I am gonna go out and purchase something, I'm gonna get something and give it to you as a gift<endOfText>
<human>then you have got to wait until I do that.<endOfText>
<bot>I might go out and buy it straight away, I might wait weeks, months  before I acquire the particular thing to give to you as a gift, you've gotta wait on on me  giving it to you.<endOfText>
<human>But once I have the thing and make it available, and say here is the gift that I promised  it's yours, it's available, then, all you have to do is come and take it.<endOfText>
<bot>And any waiting, any time lag is not my fault, it's not cos I've been slow in getting it, I've already got it there, it's all wrapped up  it's gift wrapped with your name on it!<endOfText>
<human>Any time lag, any any  period of waiting is because you haven't come and received it.<endOfText>
<bot>And so it is with God's gift of the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>He does not suggest, there is no suggestion in the New Testament that we have got to tarry, and wait, and long and, and so on for it, it's there available to receive.<endOfText>
<bot>The apostles came down  to Somaria, they laid hands on them and they were receiving the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>And this is God's purpose, he is given the Holy Spirit and he has not withdrawn him.<endOfText>
<bot>It is God's free gift to his people.<endOfText>
<human>Harold Carter, some of you will know of him and have heard of him  who was er, a preacher within  one of the early preachers within the pentecostal movement in this country, and one of their teachers, said that to teach people to wait for the Holy Spirit is nothing in the world but a combination of works, and unbelief.<endOfText>
<bot>You see, if I were to start waiting, it means I've gotta start doing something.<endOfText>
<human>What am I waiting for?<endOfText>
<bot>Am I waiting on God who is reluctant to give?<endOfText>
<human>God is the most generous giver in the universe!<endOfText>
<bot>He's not reluctant to give, he's not slow in giving.<endOfText>
<human>Jesus used the illustration, he says, you parents, you fathers, if your children are hungry you don't mock them by giving them a stone  you give them egg, you give them bread, you give them meat, you don't give them a scorpion, something to harm them, you don't mock them by giving them some, something they can't eat!<endOfText>
<bot>How much more your Heavenly Father will he give the Holy Spirit to those who ask of him?<endOfText>
<human>To those who come and receive it.<endOfText>
<bot>Notice also that Peter and John did not pray that God would give them the Holy Spirit  they prayed that they might receive the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>You haven't gotta twist God's arm to receive his gifts.<endOfText>
<bot>He is a generous giver!<endOfText>
<human>When sa , they began laying hands on them and they were receiving the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>In verse fifteen, when they came down they prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>Sometimes in our praying re , concerning the Holy Spirit, we say, we ask God to give, but God says hang on I've already given!<endOfText>
<bot>You're asking me to do what I've done!<endOfText>
<human>Pray rather, that they might receive.<endOfText>
<bot>And perhaps  we should exercise this idea, this thought  when we pray for the salvation of people.<endOfText>
<human>Not to pray that God will save, but rather that people will receive  the gift of eternal life, because God's made it available!<endOfText>
<bot>He's made his forgiveness freely available, the gift is there!<endOfText>
<human>God's gift of eternal life!<endOfText>
<bot>And the praying is not that God will save people  he's er, done all that he can to save, but rather that people will respond to his generosity and receive his gift.<endOfText>
<human>And so we see there in verse seventeen, that they began laying their hands on them and they were receiving the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>The onus was not on God doing something, but on them receiving.<endOfText>
<human>And you know, if we wait for God to baptize us in the Holy Spirit, can I suggest you'll wait until you die  and still not know that experience.<endOfText>
<bot>Because  God has done this, he's he's made him available.<endOfText>
<human>The thing is for us to receive.<endOfText>
<bot>To seek and receive that gift.<endOfText>
<human>The promise and the fulfilment, let me just give you a couple of verses there in John fourteen, John make er, Jesus he makes this statement to his disciples, in John fourteen, in verses sixteen and seventeen,and I will ask the Father and he will give you another helper , another word for the Holy Spirit,that he may be with you forever.<endOfText>
<bot>This is the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it does not know him, does not behold him or know him, but you know him because he abides with you and will be in you .<endOfText>
<human>And there,i Peter when he's preaching on the day pentecost, he says this is was has happened, God has done just that, just as Jesus promised.<endOfText>
<bot>In acts chapter two and verse thirty two,this Jesus, God raised up again to which we are all witnesses, therefore, having been exulted to the right hand of God, and having receiving from the father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured forth this which you both see and hear .<endOfText>
<human>And so,le let's just conclude our our thinking and some of the things we've been looking at,<endOfText>
<bot>a and remind ourselves that  this gift of God in th the Holy Spirit, the baptism of the spirit, it is not an optional extra, it's not something for super saint, it's not something for special people, or for certain types of people, it is a, not an optional extra, it is God's purpose for every one of his children!<endOfText>
<human>Amen!<endOfText>
<bot>Just as he purposed to save you, so his perfect will and, and desire is that you receive, that you are baptized in the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>I again, using that sermon of Peter, in acts chapter two, Peter said to them, in verse thirty eight,repent and let each of you baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, for the promise is for you and your children, and for all who will , as many as the Lord our God shall call to himself .<endOfText>
<bot>So it is not an optional extra, it's God's purpose, it's God's desire for you and for me, and for every one of his children!<endOfText>
<human>Then, the gift has already been given, and God has not withdrawn it.<endOfText>
<bot>There will come the time when he will withdraw the Holy Spirit, when he will be taken out of the world, but as long as the church of Jesus Christ is here that will not take place.<endOfText>
<human>So the gift has been given and has not been withdrawn.<endOfText>
<bot>There is only one requirement of re , to receiving God's gift of the Holy Spirit  and that is the requirement of being his child.<endOfText>
<human>The requirement of salvation.<endOfText>
<bot>Any one who is saved, any one who is a Christian, who is a follower of Jesus Christ, who has committed their life to Christ, who has received his forgiveness, and who belongs to him, any one  is ready and able to receive the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>There are no other qualifications!<endOfText>
<bot>It is a gift after all.<endOfText>
<human>Holiness, sanctification, living of Godly life, living a pure life  they're not the criteria, they're not, they're not, God requires that of us, but they are not requirements for receiving the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>We don't have to get to a certain stage of holiness.<endOfText>
<human>We don't have to get to a certain stage of sinlessness, before God will give to us the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>If that is the case then every one of us will wait till we die and we still won't know anything about this experience.<endOfText>
<human>The only qualification is that Jesus Christ has saved me and I'm following him  and I belong to him.<endOfText>
<bot>See, if it depended on  what I did, if it depended on how good I was, on how ru righteous I am, well, I am righteous in Christ!<endOfText>
<human>So, all th , even if you wanted to make that qualification, it's there, in him, I am righteous!<endOfText>
<bot>He is my righteousness, and that's how God sees me, through the righteousness of his son Jesus.<endOfText>
<human>And so we are able to receive the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>We can expect to speak in other tongues, as I've already mentioned from Mark sixteen, Jesus said it would happen.<endOfText>
<human>And as we read through  the er accounts of this experience in the acts of the apostles, we find it happening again, and again, and again, and becoming obviously the norm.<endOfText>
<bot>Now what does it do?<endOfText>
<human>When we receive the Holy Spir , what happens?<endOfText>
<bot>What did it do to us?<endOfText>
<human>What does it do your life, to my life?<endOfText>
<bot>Let me say, straight away, it does not make us invincible.<endOfText>
<human>Ha!<endOfText>
<bot>Oh no!<endOfText>
<human>It doesn't make us so that satan has no power over us, so that we never sin again.<endOfText>
<bot>It  it doesn't make us invincible.<endOfText>
<human>Not at all!<endOfText>
<bot>It doesn't give some special credence to our testimony.<endOfText>
<human>It doesn't turn us into to super soul winners.<endOfText>
<bot>Great servants of the Lord!<endOfText>
<human>It doesn't do that at all.<endOfText>
<bot>The disciples were told, before, ten days before they received the Holy Spirit that they were to be witnesses unto him.<endOfText>
<human>And as we mentioned last Sunday night this word witness it means a martyr, it means giving one's life.<endOfText>
<bot>Being totally sold out for God.<endOfText>
<human>A living martyr for him.<endOfText>
<bot>So what is it that God's give to, the Holy Spirit to us for?<endOfText>
<human>It is to empower us, it's to, to en it's to enable us  it's to to er  to give us that which we haven't got ourself .<endOfText>
<bot>But what is the, the basic primary purpose of it?<endOfText>
<human>Well, what is God's greatest purpose for you?<endOfText>
<bot>What is his greatest purpose in your life?<endOfText>
<human>It's not to make you the greatest soul winner.<endOfText>
<bot>The greatest witness.<endOfText>
<human>The greatest preacher.<endOfText>
<bot>It's not that!<endOfText>
<human>Because, by obvious reasons that can only happen to one person.<endOfText>
<bot>Greatest, is the end of the line, there can't be two greatests.<endOfText>
<human>So, that isn't his purpose for you and for me.<endOfText>
<bot>What is his purpose for our lives then?<endOfText>
<human>It's not to make us into some spiritual superstars, like some great leader of the past or present.<endOfText>
<bot>His great purpose in your life and in my life is to reproduce in our lives, the life of Jesus Christ.<endOfText>
<human>Amen.<endOfText>
<bot>Now in some folk that will take special emphasis.<endOfText>
<human>It will make them great soul winners.<endOfText>
<bot>In some, it will make them great prayers.<endOfText>
<human>In some folk it will make them this or that, perhaps, not in every body, but for some folk it will do that, but his greatest purpose in your life and in my life is to reproduce Jesus Christ to make us like him.<endOfText>
<bot>And ultimately, that will be the end of the line for every one us.<endOfText>
<human>We shall see him says John, and we shall be like him.<endOfText>
<bot>But we will see him as he is.<endOfText>
<human>And that is God's greatest purpose in your life and my life.<endOfText>
<bot>To reproduce in us the life of Jesus Christ.<endOfText>
<human>In our day to day living.<endOfText>
<bot>In our service, in our thinking, in our motives, to be like him.<endOfText>
<human>There are some folk who will talk about the  the baptism of the spirit, and the gifts of the spirit, and say, oh well, well they're all very well and good but I would rather have the fruit of the spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>That's a ridiculous statement!<endOfText>
<human>You see, it's not a case of either or God's purpose is both of them.<endOfText>
<bot>His purpose is that we might have the gifts of the spirit and develop the fruit of the spirit.<endOfText>
<human>And he doesn't offer them, it's not an either or package  it is, I want both of them in your life!<endOfText>
<bot>I want to see evidence of both of them, that is my purpose, that you may be like me.<endOfText>
<human>And he's given us certain  gifts to enable us  for this to happen in our lives.<endOfText>
<bot>And one of those gifts is the gift of the Holy Spirit, that's why it's not an optional extra.<endOfText>
<human>It is something that each one of needs.<endOfText>
<bot>In our day to day living, in our living, in our service for him, in our worship, in our relationships with one another, in our thinking, our motives, our our everything about us that we may be like him.<endOfText>
<human>Now lets just close with those words of of Peter, on the day of pentecost,it's not for other just, he says it's for you, it's for your children, and it's to as many as there are far off, right down through the centuries, as many as the Lord our God shall call .<endOfText>
<bot>And who is he referring to then, what does he mean, shall call?<endOfText>
<human>Not call to be special people, to be baptized, but shall call to be his children, his followers.<endOfText>
<bot>And so it's for you  it's for me, for the person sitting beside you and behind, it is for every one of us!<endOfText>
<human>If we are followers of Jesus Christ then he says I want you to receive my gift.<endOfText>
<bot>The gift of the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>And o on this day when the church celebrates the coming of the Holy Spirit!<endOfText>
<bot>It's not an historical thing, it's not something we look back to, but it's something that every one of us should be looking to as a present daily experience in our life.<endOfText>
<human>The bi , the New Testament uses the expression, be being filled.<endOfText>
<bot>And you and I, perhaps, we can look back to a day in our life when it was our birthday, as far as that is concerned  and God filled us with his Holy Spirit, we received the gift of the Holy Spirit, we were baptized in the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>That's great!<endOfText>
<bot>The danger is that we look back to that and think of that.<endOfText>
<human>But there's a sense in which every day has gotta be an anniversary of that, a celebration of that.<endOfText>
<bot>Be being filled with the Holy Spirit.<endOfText>
<human>It wasn't yesterday's experience, it wasn't yesteryear, it wasn't something just that happened twenty, thirty, fifty years ago, it's something, Paul says, that should be happening today!<endOfText>
<bot>Hallelujah!<endOfText>
<human>That same infilling.<endOfText>
<bot>The tap has not been turned off.<endOfText>
<human>God is still wanting to continue filling  his people, with his spirit.<endOfText>
<bot>Well let's sing again, shall we?<endOfText>
<human>From the redemption hymnal, er number two hundred and thirty.<endOfText>
<bot>Number two hundred and thirty.<endOfText>
<human>And this song does say that there is just one requirement from our part  and that is, that we want to receive.<endOfText>
<bot>That we are thirsty.<endOfText>
<human>Ho everyone that is thirsty in spirit!<endOfText>
<bot>Ho everyone that is weary and sad come to the fountain, there's fullness in Jesus, all that you're longing for!<endOfText>
<human>Come and be glad and, it goes on in chorus to use yet another picture of the Holy Spirit, we've talked of one being of fire, another picture is that of water, I will pour water on him that is thirsty!<endOfText>
<bot>I will pour floods upon the dry ground!<endOfText>
<human>Open your heart for the gift I am bringing.<endOfText>
<bot>While you are seeking me I will be found .<endOfText>
<human>Two thirty, and let's stand to sing.<endOfText>
<bot><endOfText>
<human>Okay, if you'd like to push on.<endOfText>
<bot>Just for those of you who have just arrived , we're actually recording this session as part of a  a large spoken database which is gonna be part of a national archive  and so you're being recorded for posterity.<endOfText>
<human>We've got a translator for Roger  so they will be able to understand him.<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>Okay?<endOfText>
<bot>So that you're gonna  database then.<endOfText>
<human>Erm right!<endOfText>
<bot>Er Martin  see , sends his apologies I'll be actually chairing the meeting for him.<endOfText>
<human>Erm so  so if you'd like to  kick off.<endOfText>
<bot>What I'd like to do is go through the minutes of the last meeting.<endOfText>
<human>First, for a matter of record  and each other accurate, accurately recollect  oh we're actually taping this.<endOfText>
<bot>So if anybody would like to shout out if there's not  an accurate  well if somebody actually listened to it.<endOfText>
<human>Onto page one  page two  page three  page four  and five.<endOfText>
<bot>So we all agree that's a  accurate, vaguely accurate reflection of what happened?<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>I'd like to go back to the minutes in terms of matters arising which don't arise under the  the agenda items.<endOfText>
<human>On page one I think that we will record the .<endOfText>
<bot>Mm!<endOfText>
<human>On page two I think the first thing was, was the erm  results of the air conditioning on  Wellesey House is still omitted.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I'm  <endOfText>
<bot>Still be waiting on them?<endOfText>
<human>Well  we've, we've had interim  or final interim reports  and wishing now that Whiskers  are actually gonna look at Dixons for me.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>but erm  we're nearly there.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>Put against the letters that I wrote they've all been sent out.<endOfText>
<bot>I've actually got thirty one copies of  at the moment.<endOfText>
<human>But it's interesting to know that a lot of the copies  either  must have copies, which they should have  or that they know what  bin it.<endOfText>
<bot>It should be a long drawn out process.<endOfText>
<human>And I'm sure you'll find a way Steve.<endOfText>
<bot>Very long, drawn out process.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>With regard to any regulations on fire precautions  erm  department  well the government is sitting on those, it's unlikely they will be out much before January of next year.<endOfText>
<human>As soon as I get a draft I'll I'll  let you know  what the  perfections are.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay fine.<endOfText>
<human>Now, V D U and eye tests I'll take over the main primary agenda.<endOfText>
<bot>Just to give you an update of price.<endOfText>
<human>My next comment about erm  concerning  it's getting  saving tables and the like  we've actually  er agreed accommodation schedule for this year  and that's following fro from some changes in Customer Services o , in July.<endOfText>
<bot>So, er  to programme a new network.<endOfText>
<human>In terms of review of staggered hours  erm  the review is sort of a constant one which has not really come to head yet, in terms of actually being able to write something down, so I'm we'll be able to  as soon as we, as soon I've something which we  erm, come to any conclusions in terms of staggered hours.<endOfText>
<bot>The, one about the security guard, Bill   he, he's now made arrangements for  the attendance  a first aid  er, meetings.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>That is, in actual fact, a bit difficult for <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>at the moment, you can appreciate <endOfText>
<human>Mm, mm mm.<endOfText>
<bot>cos if he  he's on a twelve hour shift  and, those meetings tend to  be  have been around the same sort of time, then obviously, what we've gotta be careful about is, adding any more hours<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>onto what he's already  taken on here.<endOfText>
<human>So that's, what we've got to understand is that .<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I think obviously, need to be making an appearance now than<endOfText>
<bot>Yep.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Suzanne you  you're reporting Martin ?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Back in the index of bulletins.<endOfText>
<human>Erm<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, Paula <endOfText>
<human>Paula <endOfText>
<bot>Twenty four.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, erm  she's nearly finished it, Paula, and  and it will be issued shortly  that.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Okay, it goes onto the main primary agenda for most of the time.<endOfText>
<bot>Moving onto safety, am I right?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>We did at erm  we've actually erm  sorted the issue abo , out about erm  gritting the car park.<endOfText>
<bot>It erm  security are actually carrying it out and clearing the best positions  to, to do so.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Then, er overnight.<endOfText>
<human>They've also issued to me the appropriate  er protective equipment as well and so that er  they don't  you know, so I'll assume that is on the way.<endOfText>
<bot>Good!<endOfText>
<human>And we've al , we've also<endOfText>
<bot>Sorry!<endOfText>
<human>Sorry carry on.<endOfText>
<bot>and also erm  spoken to the police in relation to emergency evacuation in the back.<endOfText>
<human>The police have sor , have got a copy of our emergency evacuation procedures, at the moment we're waiting for them  to return it to us.<endOfText>
<bot>Once they've done that then  we shall take the appropriate action needed.<endOfText>
<human>Right!<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, if there's anything else?<endOfText>
<human>Well there's the,?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>John, did you get any reply from the police on that?<endOfText>
<human>Well , yeah, I spoke to them like, on the telephone, erm  and  basically they er  and we agreed that we wouldn't take it any further  so  it er  happened to be a police officer's view  as against our view, and whilst we didn't agree with the view, er  we sent enough references to make our point known anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>So you can take it up with the, the er  do whatever he felt necessary, but we left it at that.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, I mean the point the police have made has been addressed,<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>but the reasons why have er<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>I'd like permission.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I think that's supposed to mean  something, I dunno !<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, it's  yeah,.<endOfText>
<human>Well the next point is between Roger and  John, I didn't understand at all so could you<endOfText>
<bot>Good!!<endOfText>
<human>I think someone's already  John!<endOfText>
<bot>Maybe you'll like this one?<endOfText>
<human>At erm  that's  that big lighting is there  on the basis that if the switch goes down we should have a number of telephones that still have to be available  erm and  we need to identify them  suggested by a red telephone, or using a red telephone situated somewhere.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, and the issue was yes, we need some  for emergency use  and erm  we will also need proba , probably need some for business use.<endOfText>
<human>I  have spoken Joe , and I sent a memo to  a copy to Martin  er, suggesting where these should be placed and how they should be dealt with.<endOfText>
<bot>And er  we're now sort of waiting  to get serious enough.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Okay, so  have gone down there to  emphasize the importance of accidents.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, I'll take down the other, the main agenda cos we've  we've sort of set up a special group for the  .<endOfText>
<human>And the next point  on the  on the number of things that are being reported in  the accident books.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  I've in fact, become a bit of a artist on, on  accident book, and between the nineteen of June ninety two  and sixteen and September, er December rather  there were twenty two  complaints logged about sickness, diarrhoea, sore throat, sore , and headaches, from the first floor  erm, of which  twenty of these complaints were from females, and two were from males.<endOfText>
<human>And it is er<endOfText>
<bot>It's not very popular !<endOfText>
<human>Indeed not!<endOfText>
<bot>Let's hear this out.<endOfText>
<human>Merely presenting it in er  as analysis.<endOfText>
<bot>I actually dissuaded er<endOfText>
<human>What's the proportion of females on that floor?<endOfText>
<bot>Er, good question !<endOfText>
<human>Actually noticed, with an inkling of  as well.<endOfText>
<bot>So er  she was the one who pointed that fact to me.<endOfText>
<human>I wouldn't have worked it out, so  erm<endOfText>
<bot>Stop digging will you !<endOfText>
<human>There haven't been any other erm  any other areas  er, of complaint with er<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>i er in tha , in that  on the second or third floors  but I did, in fact, look at the first, second and third floors to get a comparison.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, the conditions were  erm  slightly different on the second floor, in the sense that  there were a few, few people and a few items of equipment  erm, and there is a relatively great density of staff on the first floor  than I would have found .<endOfText>
<human>But, if we then, we then considered  non air conditioning explanations  erm  which, I don't want to go into but  there's all sorts of  text that one could  mention.<endOfText>
<bot>But  if we look at the air conditioning explanations  we  we reckon that the conditions likely to lead to sickness  and, and the related illnesses that were mentioned  er  was, the low humidity  that  that we thought might er, be in the area  erm, because it dries out the  and enables viruses  to enter the body more  more easily.<endOfText>
<human>And the, the other one  was  the  potentially reduce ventilation  because, erm, the the insufficient air supply, air flow within that area means that  the airborne viruses aren't getting shifted fast enough.<endOfText>
<bot>And, we also face with a  a certain stance there where  if people  blame, er, turn round to us and say  there's a draft here  because er, the air conditioning's working they don't wanna sit in a draft.<endOfText>
<human>We have, in the past, switched the air conditioning down  which reduces the ventilation which means  creates, makes the situation worse.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, there's <endOfText>
<human>there's two elements in relation to the air conditioning itself, er  spreading viruses, and we  take two preventative actions  one of which is that we spray all the air conditioning ducts work quarterly  with, what's known, as a virucide and  I relate that to the equivalent of sticking a  a toilet block in the toilet, it kills all  all known airborne germs sort of thing.<endOfText>
<bot>And the other thing is, is that all the air  that  is within the building is directly supplied from outside the building  and is then extracted  extracted to the exterior of the building.<endOfText>
<human>We don't actually recirculate the air within the building, so there's no business of  people on the second floor giving germs to people on the first floor, and then people  giving germs to people on the ground floor.<endOfText>
<bot>So, those are the actions that we actually take with the air conditioning itself.<endOfText>
<human>Erm<endOfText>
<bot>Can I just so , can I still <endOfText>
<human>the <endOfText>
<bot>pick them up?<endOfText>
<human>Sorry!<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, sorry!<endOfText>
<human>I was looking at actions <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>next <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>but if you've got any questions on that front?<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>A, just a question of whether the  sorry, you've done all these statistics, whether actually the first floor was, seemed to be a problem?<endOfText>
<bot>Statistically.<endOfText>
<human>Well  ah, that's one of the things I'm leading to.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>This was, this was, if you like  a record of the eye approach, we went round, we felt the air and  erm, er made judgement, in the same that people like to be making judgements<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>about how stuffy it is, and the like  when we agreed that is was  erm  not as good as it could be, may I just say  erm, but we haven't got any, if you like,er statistical measurement, and one of the actual points that were starting to do now  is we're actually going to start reporting tu , temperature and humidity on the first, second, and third floors within G P House.<endOfText>
<bot>And we're gonna start publishing that information.<endOfText>
<human>In actual fact,<endOfText>
<bot>Can I just ask why you're ignoring us lot on the ground floor?<endOfText>
<human>Why?<endOfText>
<bot>Well you've <endOfText>
<human>I mean <endOfText>
<bot>got the doors open  presumably!<endOfText>
<human>I don't know why you're getting so !<endOfText>
<bot>Because, I'm responding directly to  accident  books, and similar conditions.<endOfText>
<human>Ah, I see!<endOfText>
<bot>And the conditions on the ground floor are somewhat different.<endOfText>
<human>Cos it's mainly men on the ground floor they don't <endOfText>
<bot>I see, yes!<endOfText>
<human>complain you see!<endOfText>
<bot>I think I've been sadistically grouped!<endOfText>
<human>Erm<endOfText>
<bot>But er<endOfText>
<human>but erm  anyway  I've forgotten what I was saying now.<endOfText>
<bot>I be , so one of the things we're gonna do is publish that information on a regular basis.<endOfText>
<human>Erm  and we have in fact, done some tests on the first and second floor since  we did this  eye test  and  er, humidity is in fact, within the  the er  the Health and Safety legislation, it's within tolerance.<endOfText>
<bot>Presumably the temperatures are too.<endOfText>
<human>But, one of things that we are discovering is that when people complain about drafts  er, we've been switching the air conditioning up and down to balance it up to suit the individuals needs.<endOfText>
<bot>What we may have to do is actually balance the air conditioning's needs up  to suit  the building, if you like, rather than individuals concerned, and then we'll have to address the individuals concerns the same, in terms of moving the desk, or moving the person  if they're in a draft.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, and we also need obviously, to educate people there.<endOfText>
<bot>The consequences of them wanting the drafts to be turned down.<endOfText>
<human>Because, if we don't actually ventilate the building  then, we're not actually gonna solve the problem .<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>And we're gonna get hot spots and cold spots.<endOfText>
<bot>Fine.<endOfText>
<human>In terms of your research on the  the action book itself, or th , or the reports or whatever  you said, sorry, there's nineteen on the first floor you say?<endOfText>
<bot>I gave you a copy of the notes actually, Mark.<endOfText>
<human>No , no you said at the start of this .<endOfText>
<bot>There's erm  there's twenty  beg your pardon, there's twenty two complaints<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>that we had in a six month period.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>of which  er er, that was to do with sickness, diarrhoea, sore throats, sore  <endOfText>
<human>dizziness, headaches<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>which could be air conditioning related.<endOfText>
<bot>Right!<endOfText>
<human>We don't know whether they're on, they're on the first, second or third?<endOfText>
<bot>That's just the first floor.<endOfText>
<human>They were all on the first floor Mark.<endOfText>
<bot>No complaints on the second floor, or the third floor, or the ground floor.<endOfText>
<human>What?<endOfText>
<bot>Well that's fairly sig titi fa , significant innit?<endOfText>
<human>One of the four floors has a got a problem.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Roger, wasn't I  correct in thinking that Paula was also going to look at  erm  not just accident reports, other sickness for the area, to actually <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah I I did look at it from  from  from after Christmas and there have been no complaints at all, in the accident book  up until the eighteenth of March  that were of that nature.<endOfText>
<human>There was a <endOfText>
<bot>Mm mm.<endOfText>
<human>exact  <endOfText>
<bot>Ten of that eleven people in the last two weeks, sort of, complaining about but they don't always  let me know so that I can document it, that's the problem.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Where is that, still on the fou , first floor?<endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So<endOfText>
<human>Mainly in F two and F three rooms.<endOfText>
<bot>It's now, like the stomach cramp rather than <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>and  it's not people that have eaten, not   certainly not the restaurant , what should I say <endOfText>
<human>It's the food,the food!<endOfText>
<bot>but they're not actually, having been to lunch and <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I know, for a fact, one person us , never uses canteen at<endOfText>
<human>One?<endOfText>
<bot>Well it's, yeah <endOfText>
<human>One.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean the problem is, I mean, that the significance of the com , the sort of the numbers of those are still particularly low<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>and trying to  one was  one would assume, that to a certain extent, if you've got a problem with air conditioning that we would  we would have a higher, a higher incidence  of erm  of those sort of complaints.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>And we don't.<endOfText>
<human>No, what I'm saying is, I don't think from the accident book you're getting a true picture because people don't always report it, they'll be off several days afterwards.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Just don't compla , I just wondered whether that was actually <endOfText>
<bot>Ah , yeah, again<endOfText>
<human>But the information we <endOfText>
<bot>all <endOfText>
<human>do have does amount to something.<endOfText>
<bot>And something <endOfText>
<human>Well it's something that we're prepared to actually act on here is <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>erm, the thing about it is  is that  I mean, one of  we we've at the minute we've been faced with  with some individuals  reckoning that they have er  rashes forming  around the face  er  in a number of areas  and there's  an indication that, and it's nothing more than that, that it could actually be to do with the laser printers and people sitting near them  in the light.<endOfText>
<bot>People suffering from dry skin, but it's the only wo , odd one case or another that actually reported, but it  we don't know how widespread these things are.<endOfText>
<human>We've had Wintams in   <endOfText>
<bot>But they're actually, they actually <endOfText>
<human>last week.<endOfText>
<bot>made out a thermal comfort test  on G P House  over the last few days  er, and we're now awaiting their results.<endOfText>
<human>And that's really to look at, the sort of the, the dry skin  issues and so on?<endOfText>
<bot>I think the thing we've gotta be careful about, is also trying to er  i if we  ask everybody put all their analysis as such, we could start thinking  panicking or whatever<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>for all the wrong reasons, so we're trying to sort of pick a number of tests which will determine whether there's a problem with air conditioning and it's humidity or  or er  or if the temperature.<endOfText>
<human>And if we can pin those down, and as Roger said, we've also now, over the last few weeks co begun carrying out erm  regular testing two or three times a day now on each of the floors and looking at the humidity <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>in there.<endOfText>
<bot>And we've gotta,wha what we'll do we'll get those set up at the  sort of  the appropriate working temperatures, and working humidity and then we will have to deal with people on an individual basis, if basically, they're uncomfortable because of draft or whatever it might be.<endOfText>
<human>I think that's what we're aiming to do now, get things set up as a standard  er, operating  erm, levels, having done that  then we begin <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>to isolate them.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh sure!<endOfText>
<human>As I say I'm    I'm not convinced that it's air conditioning  erm, but then again  there's more detail, more data that's required.<endOfText>
<bot>Next twenty,.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, if they want,.<endOfText>
<human>So essentially, what you're saying is we've got the erm  the sort of environmental checks in  place, to help <endOfText>
<bot>Yes indeed!<endOfText>
<human>track down,ho , home <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>home in on the  <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>But it will take time.<endOfText>
<bot>Eventually.<endOfText>
<human>And I've done myself a  on that reckoning, because until we've got that sorted anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>Wintams actually  er quarterly check the air  within G P House, and the water within G P House.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>And erm  to that extent  we can respond very rapidly if  those results aren't within the, the limits  defined.<endOfText>
<human>And we've never had  any problems in that area at all, so, to that extent.<endOfText>
<bot>We are taking, if you like, all preventative medsi , medicine we need to take  and  always difficult to in fact, to pin these things down.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Is there any er, other things anybody wants to  ah John, did you want?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>What I was gonna suggest is that, we actually put something in the bulletin, not in the sense of, well, you know  please report your illnesses kind of thing, but  if we just make people aware of actually this sort of environmental control thing would be a good idea.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I think that's a fair comment.<endOfText>
<bot>And the  and the measures that we're here, that's a good idea actually!<endOfText>
<human>Been my major struggle for a long time now.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm!<endOfText>
<human>Mostly definite the restaurant.<endOfText>
<bot>What have I done !<endOfText>
<human>Not bad!<endOfText>
<bot>We would do it!<endOfText>
<human>Okay, move  on to first aid.<endOfText>
<bot>Do we know whether we have the updated<endOfText>
<human>Yes we have.<endOfText>
<bot>We have.<endOfText>
<human>On the erm  there won't be the first aid room over the   we're looking to move that to the first floor.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh I'm sorry!<endOfText>
<human>Can you speak up then?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh sorry!<endOfText>
<human>Have I   <endOfText>
<bot>Mm mm.<endOfText>
<human>Have they liaised with you?<endOfText>
<bot>Not yet, no.<endOfText>
<human>Ha!<endOfText>
<bot>That's alright then !<endOfText>
<human>I gave the list to  Martin   at the last meeting.<endOfText>
<bot>And attendance is much better cos I think  the message is finally getting across now.<endOfText>
<human>Sorry!<endOfText>
<bot>Can you  er mm.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah , just saying that when we move the erm  the first aid room to the, to the first floor  from  House.<endOfText>
<bot>That's a definite is it?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>I erm  as much as anything else so that we don't block a fire exit on the gro , on, in the basement.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Have you seen the timetable for that.<endOfText>
<bot>Er no, not yet.<endOfText>
<human>I'm sure you'll tell us er<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Okay, fire?<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Involving the fire, the exit th there, we actually talked about  er, issuing a memo to all the branches  and telling them there ought not be electrical equipment on overnight.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>I counted something like   and at the moment it appertains just to the telephone system and regard to the enquiry system.<endOfText>
<bot>And  but, very shortly the branches are gonna be  getting some more appropriate , and it's gonna be a lot more that needs to be se sort of kept on overnight.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>But it might be more appropriate to wait until  nearer the time to send a memo, I don't know.<endOfText>
<human>Erm  on the audit side both Karen and I have been round to all the branches in order to deal with our old equipment.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  on October ninety four I'll be, guess there won't be any old prices in the .<endOfText>
<human>You've been round to all the branches?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>It's  on, on a different project but we were <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>incorporating that on the way round.<endOfText>
<bot>With regard to leaving  electrical equipment on overnight, Mark, erm  once or twice  be nice if you already be bought it to my attention that people are leaving things on  erm, now, when we've had this discussion that most of these  items are safe.<endOfText>
<human>But erm  I th they are worried  certainly, one or two of them are worried, but er  some of this equipment is left on, and left on unnecessarily  and we ought to be encouraging people to switch off what isn't<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>doesn't have to be left on overnight.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, sort of a general memo about the, just er literally  good housekeeping if nothing else.<endOfText>
<human>If you're not using the equipment  or you don't need to use the equipment overnight then please turn it off.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Er<endOfText>
<bot>Presumably you get some  card license installed, so  mind you, you'd  the outcome!<endOfText>
<human>Erm, yes I think, I think, you know, immediately you're thinking of doing it the branches and obviously you're running po , pretty big  in <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>the way I see it, anyway, you know, if there are  things that are meant to be left on .<endOfText>
<bot>Er, as far the  these building are concerned  I think your point is valid, I mean, I think probably printers, I think that you suggest are left on  because you never know when it'll be  to.<endOfText>
<human>Er, only got one persons  <endOfText>
<bot>Assume the responsibility?<endOfText>
<human>But, other than that, yeah  I think you're right.<endOfText>
<bot>Presumably with an arrow, you have to Mark, Mark.<endOfText>
<human>I think there are some things Mark that have to be left on<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>as an necessity there  for all these  working overnight.<endOfText>
<bot>But those that aren't  erm  should be switched off and whether there's a way <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>of sort of having some kind  <endOfText>
<human>Perhaps I'll , perhaps I'll liaise with Chris <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>through his team and see how it, see if there's <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>anything<endOfText>
<bot>you also probably need to liaise with erm  probably with Mike  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>and you know, find out what they're doing, but  general .<endOfText>
<human>I've gotta liaise with the information centre in  the computer centre tomorrow  see if there's any guidelines we could probably use.<endOfText>
<bot>There may be some kind of notice on them that says, you know, these machines should not be switched and then everything would be switched off.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>If they came round <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, that's the sort of thing.<endOfText>
<human>It's<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, our ones' actually got something on, especially one of the machines it's got little spots across the screen saying do not .<endOfText>
<human>Do not switch off.<endOfText>
<bot>Switch off.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah!<endOfText>
<bot>But I mean <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>so they wouldn't switch it off.<endOfText>
<human>But are others  <endOfText>
<bot>Still, still switch off!<endOfText>
<human>Oh do they?<endOfText>
<bot>But they're very !<endOfText>
<human>Okay, fine!<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>Onto any other business.<endOfText>
<bot>Ah sorry!<endOfText>
<human>Have you  done the, done the agenda?<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Finished that.<endOfText>
<bot>I think Pa Paula on the  's information.<endOfText>
<human>Er  she said it was done.<endOfText>
<bot>And she did check, and we weren't telling them, no we did?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you think it's a representative coming to this meeting rather than just simply<endOfText>
<human>think they actually go off site <endOfText>
<bot>the information?<endOfText>
<human>in places like <endOfText>
<bot>I presume , I presume <endOfText>
<human>that they, they'd be the only one.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh right!<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>The th <endOfText>
<human>Ye Yep!<endOfText>
<bot>The collapsing chair<endOfText>
<human>is erm  is a mystery!<endOfText>
<bot>And it's not just a mystery to me, but a mystery to the individual I spoke to.<endOfText>
<human>Er  the chair being the offender, given the chair that collapsed underneath her  er, she couldn't, or she couldn't  explain to me how the chair managed to collapse underneath her!<endOfText>
<bot>So, I'm afraid I wasn't able to do a great to do a great deal more on that.<endOfText>
<human>The only thing I would say is, is that  we're looking to  er start in the next quarter  various plans for  maintenance routines  one of which will be o , actually on furniture.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, there's a number of issues that will start cropping up with furniture fairly soon.<endOfText>
<human>And, it's things like that I ne , hope and anticipate that we can actually .<endOfText>
<bot>I can only guess that  for erm  some reason  the bolts on the back of the chair fell off, or came lose  and when she sat on it  she leaned on the back, in an unusual position  and fell through!<endOfText>
<human>Mm mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's go onto COSHE regulations.<endOfText>
<human>We've had a meeting on COSHE and we've sort of put the erm  the  revisions of COSHE into, into action.<endOfText>
<bot>Basically this is updating the original COSHE, COSHE re register.<endOfText>
<human>And Katie is the only one that sent a reply back!<endOfText>
<bot>That's very prompt of you Katie!<endOfText>
<human>Gold star!<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, point taken!<endOfText>
<human>I don't think the date was due actually was, wasn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>No, it's not yet.<endOfText>
<human>It's erm, the week<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>of  let's look in my diary.<endOfText>
<bot>If ever that's forgotten, once that's done, again it will be erm  the up-to-date part of the  COSHE.<endOfText>
<human>And the fire and train records, I'm not sure where .<endOfText>
<bot>Well, the meeting that we're doing, all branch<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>probably<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>And I'll take that  management one.<endOfText>
<bot>No , er dust mites?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, er can I go back to this point before <endOfText>
<bot>Mm mm.<endOfText>
<human>about erm    I've actually got some  some cleansing wipes for, for <endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>I was actually going to  give to you Sue, so that you could test them but I understand you've already got some new ones?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>You're talking about to send some aren't you?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I'll, I'll drop that off with you today  later on.<endOfText>
<bot>Fine.<endOfText>
<human>What exactly is the intention  i in the  ?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, we'll see how much instigated first.<endOfText>
<human>Are they not in<endOfText>
<bot>Cos they won't be used to just <endOfText>
<human>cleaning telephones up like that one!<endOfText>
<bot>Foot and mouth !<endOfText>
<human>Well how many joint telephones are there?<endOfText>
<bot>Sorry?<endOfText>
<human>How many joint telephones can you have?<endOfText>
<bot>There seem to be a number in Client Services.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>In some teams there's <endOfText>
<bot>It's obviously <endOfText>
<human>about four <endOfText>
<bot>Oh!<endOfText>
<human>people share a phone.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Sorry?<endOfText>
<human>That's what I used to do with them!<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Now that you've gone.<endOfText>
<bot>Well<endOfText>
<human>I'll talk to Sue about that one!<endOfText>
<bot>Right, Sue's gonna have two goes next time.<endOfText>
<human>Still haven't told me what I've gotta do with them!<endOfText>
<bot>We could try it on our floor couldn't we?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>See how we get on.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>What exactly are you trying?<endOfText>
<human>That the people complaining they so sore throats, sickness and diarrhoea!<endOfText>
<bot>That's exactly what  been the problem down there.<endOfText>
<human>Oh!<endOfText>
<bot>Oh it's good money  <endOfText>
<human>telephones!<endOfText>
<bot>You can go and have a look.<endOfText>
<human>Especially where those people are passing the germs down the telephone!<endOfText>
<bot>It's a good idea, but I don't  really see what you're actually sort of measuring.<endOfText>
<human>Have been <endOfText>
<bot>Well I wasn't here, so I won't take any of the blame for this at all!<endOfText>
<human>It's a really good job whether yo sa sa say so or not!<endOfText>
<bot>It could be sort of spread throughout the company.<endOfText>
<human>May maybe a hygiene requirement  ?<endOfText>
<bot>What, sickness and diarrhoea?<endOfText>
<human>It's to provide, to provide people with the opportunity use the wipes if they require as a safety precaution.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh we'll sort it out anyway, Sue shall we?<endOfText>
<human>Right!<endOfText>
<bot>On the dust mites<endOfText>
<human>On the dust mites, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  the cleaning of the carpets on the first and second floors erm  they obviously  fumigate them  erm, but we don't  do the dry clean like we do the  carpets over here.<endOfText>
<human>Er, what we'll do is spray the carpets  erm  quarterly.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  one of the problems that we've been facing in the past, certainly, in G P House is the amount of stuff that's on the floor  and therefore we haven't actually been able to tackle these things  very effectively.<endOfText>
<human>Erm  but one of the things that I am doing is over the next quarter  with, various people  begin to review the cleaning schedules of what they actually do, whether we  clean them on a  on a more frequent basis  rather than just responding that particular area.<endOfText>
<bot>Get in the dust busters couldn't you for this one!<endOfText>
<human>There's actually another complaint this morning I've had on  the first floor of G P House.<endOfText>
<bot>It's only the second offence according to the last <endOfText>
<human>What's wrong with this first floor?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean when they gonna <endOfText>
<human>It's my wing as well!<endOfText>
<bot>Erm<endOfText>
<human>Militants in there!<endOfText>
<bot>so I'll be coming to see you.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, fine.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>If we move on to the main agenda.<endOfText>
<human>For the sake of this .<endOfText>
<bot>Oh!<endOfText>
<human>Erm, as I mentioned with the  group visitors  we've started up a branch action group fo specifically focused on the sort of branch issues.<endOfText>
<bot>Aren't we just leaving that till last?<endOfText>
<human>This is basically to ensure that the, the branches are  complying er to legislations.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, we're looking at, to whether  the branch and the manager, sort of be  take a more active role including the  the branch sector.<endOfText>
<human>Because at the moment there's no one looking at  health and safety on day to day basis and  in any of the branches.<endOfText>
<bot>There's just point if anyone, someone from head office goes in.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>And what this actually came out on was this overall health and safety assessment that we've been doing for G P  erm, we've actually just filed that  overall group focused on the  the branches as a potential issue  and I know it's been very su su successful on a number of times.<endOfText>
<human>What we try do and is actually sort of focus in on the branches so that so, to try and get try and get all the strains together.<endOfText>
<bot>What are the issues are we dealing with ?<endOfText>
<human>And we've had one meeting be , between, just really detailed some of the, some of the issues that we find  and focus on them a bit more.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Erm mm, the other thing I was gonna mention which is, which we've sort of really gone through is the air conditioning and that we're actually sort o , we are doing  the monitoring of the environment and all, and have had Wi <endOfText>
<bot>Wintams in  erm doing special exercises for us.<endOfText>
<human>Er, I think we should look for  through in the terms of the bulletin.<endOfText>
<bot>The only thing for me is really just to bring you up-to-date in terms of the V D U project and where we are with that.<endOfText>
<human>Erm  so, if you remember this is the reassessment of work stations.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm,the particular one I'm focusing on here is sort of the, the vision screening part of it cos the assessment of work stations is gonna be a longer term thing, we're going back to pre where they've actually sort of ticked the various boxes on the sheets  and said this is like that and so we are collating that information currently.<endOfText>
<human>But, in terms of the  the actual vision screening itself  erm, we've iden , those people who've been identified as V D U, V D U users'  we've had about five hundred and fifty replies to that,from the V D U, V D U, users'.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, of that five hundred and fifty approximately four hundred have requested eye tests  or vision screen tests, sorry!<endOfText>
<human>Erm, we've, we've had about approximately seventy tests take so , taken  place so far.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know an anybody's in this group's  partaking in this?<endOfText>
<human>But it's basically down on the  down on the first floor, we've set aside a  a room which  erm  the people from the Occupational Health Centre  here in Harlow, come up  and do vision screening for us on a regular basis they come  when do they come?<endOfText>
<bot>Once a week or<endOfText>
<human>Erm, it's once a week, but I think they're coming in  the they're here twice this week  er, and I think, it's as and when they can, so if it's more than once a week then they will be here.<endOfText>
<bot>Yep.<endOfText>
<human>Erm,right!<endOfText>
<bot>So, of the er, er yeah, of the people who were identified as being users', V D U users' we've had about eight percent of the replies have actually been returned, so we are chasing some.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Some outstanding ones.<endOfText>
<human>Yo , for your own information, as th , say health and safety group, in terms of people who ha , who undertake vision screening and then get referred on from a, for a full  full eye tests  it's usually around<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>between sort of two and four percent tend to get referred on.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, and we have had , I think about four or five people who are currently being referred on<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>er, in terms of eye tests.<endOfText>
<human>And what happens to them, again, through the Occupational Health Centre,th they arra arrange for an optician to give them a full, full eye test  and then we get a report back on that situation.<endOfText>
<bot>I've, certainly had no a ,excuse me, no adverse comments back in terms  the vision screening etcetera, itself as er, people have sort of responded to it  seems to have had a  so something which will be quite good  sort of go going along in the right spirit.<endOfText>
<human>Have you any feedback anyone  at all?<endOfText>
<bot>Have you <endOfText>
<human>?<endOfText>
<bot>No, not yet.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>a report from  vision screening.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Though it not be  for a safety to anybody else in terms of operations, I think  .<endOfText>
<human>I had erm  those, well it's actually been reported in the accident book, erm  a girl tripped, and Ted, Mick, John, and  Roger <endOfText>
<bot>Ah yes!<endOfText>
<human>Yes!<endOfText>
<bot>are aware of this.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, the wires have clipped up now.<endOfText>
<bot>She fell and hit her head, or something.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, you say that they're going to tidied in July,thi this year<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, yes.<endOfText>
<human>when the moves take place?<endOfText>
<bot>Not all of them, no!<endOfText>
<human>.<endOfText>
<bot>depends when it happens, I mean  we we're still waiting to find out where some of the changes, erm  in terms of layouts and the like are gonna be done.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, but following on from that, wherever we  change layouts now we try and be very specific about  organizing the cable management up front and, so that they don't present any hassles.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, in the Customer Services area  once we've seen what changes Customer Service wish to make  during this year that they  myself and Roger and gonna find that out, hopefully, tomorrow, erm, then we'll  be more specific about the areas that we have to address on th , the first and second floor.<endOfText>
<human>We could, that's  one of our biggest areas <endOfText>
<bot>anyway  erm  and if P D  er, remains a problem, or isn't gonna be addressed as far as the changes <endOfText>
<human>I've been told since , I was told yesterday <endOfText>
<bot>then <endOfText>
<human>that they wouldn't be  it's <endOfText>
<bot>in which case then we'll address <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>that  erm<endOfText>
<human>before  the other moves take place.<endOfText>
<bot>I , cos I know our people, and Ted have  are reluctant, they think it's a danger to  sit there, the wires are coming down already!<endOfText>
<human>Erm<endOfText>
<bot>Th , this is the cable wires is it?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Er <endOfText>
<human>Oh!<endOfText>
<bot>Yes it is.<endOfText>
<human>Erm , the cables?<endOfText>
<bot>I, I can't comment specifically to that.<endOfText>
<human>Er, we'll have to take that as it goes.<endOfText>
<bot>Se I send somebody up there and they cou , you know, put them up as best they could.<endOfText>
<human>Erm  cabling is a problem  on most of the first floor<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>because it's  the one area of G P House where there is a co wide scale movements take place.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>But there is.<endOfText>
<bot>But you said , when we do a move, we do try to , you know, where we can<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>by   and tidy the cabling as well.<endOfText>
<human>And there was a memo to John from yourself, tenth of Jan , that my manager has passed to me, it said you'd given two options that you could go in on Saturday and  erm <endOfText>
<bot>That's alright, I mean <endOfText>
<human>also that <endOfText>
<bot>tha , that's, that's the activity that we're trying to sort of resume  erm <endOfText>
<human>That's the main <endOfText>
<bot>erm <endOfText>
<human>thing.<endOfText>
<bot>but  that comes after  any moves that I'm making  because  clearly, they need somebody that can be<endOfText>
<human>So do you know  what the price is going be?<endOfText>
<bot>sort of, to put it, I'm gonna be is that as from tomorrow we will have identified  what erm  desking and so on will be moved during the reorganization  erm, and obviously  any of the desking that isn't gonna be moved until the organization, we'll be tidying up the cables.<endOfText>
<human>The others, and that maybe just a question of tying them up and <endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>making sure they're safe, even though they'll still be, sort of, visually  erm  they'll be seen, erm they'll be actually tidied on the desk.<endOfText>
<bot>But  er, the others, anything that isn't gonna be changed where the cabling is untidy, is dangerous, will have to picked up before that.<endOfText>
<human>Right!<endOfText>
<bot>And that's the sort of thing that we will be identifying as from tomorrow.<endOfText>
<human>Tomorrow.<endOfText>
<bot>Then we'll be putting it back there, on exactly how and when  action ca can <endOfText>
<human>Oh, okay.<endOfText>
<bot>be addressed, hopefully.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>It is, it is a problem, it's not necessarily <endOfText>
<human>something that can be addressed wi with a few cable ties, cos sometimes tying the cables together make a more of a  danger than <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>leaving them loose.<endOfText>
<bot>Because, you know  like if people can get a foot caught round them, if they're individual they  they come out<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>and sort of those, will get, people trip over.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>Well clearly, we need to  you know, the long term moves which we you're obviously taking of in terms of the long running programmes is fine.<endOfText>
<bot>But, I think once you've decided to schedule it there's areas we still look at, and the managers are saying  this looks dangerous, then we have to .<endOfText>
<human>Yes, in hand, yes it seems <endOfText>
<bot>Mm, yes I think we've done that.<endOfText>
<human>specific areas<endOfText>
<bot>That's actually been identified and that's, that's the route we're taking on.<endOfText>
<human>Right!<endOfText>
<bot>What else?<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>I see.<endOfText>
<human>now, is it?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Any other safety?<endOfText>
<bot>We'll move onto the accident books, any things, or any issues that anybody's seen from the reports   action?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, something came up yesterday  i in the catering unit  found out that erm  a first-aider in area, area hadn't actually been reporting all minor accidents, erm, and I think she felt perhaps they were a bit too minor to report.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, I'm wondering maybe due to the small amount of incidents actually in accident book, whether this is  perhaps a general trend going on throughout?<endOfText>
<human>I did speak to Paula yesterday, and she said she was gonna speak to you Suzanne<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>about bringing it up in the next erm  meeting.<endOfText>
<bot>I was gonna say the same to you.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But erm <endOfText>
<human>Generally , I I  enter in the accident book if I give any treatment.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  had she be giving treatment?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Should do, I think.<endOfText>
<human>I think she felt wi , you know, some of them are sort of like, a bit unimportant.<endOfText>
<bot>She's now erm, aware of the situation.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>But erm  I was just concerned  you know, that<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>perhaps it it might be going on<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, well I think <endOfText>
<human>elsewhere.<endOfText>
<bot>it's only  if you can reinforce it <endOfText>
<human>You know, there's that and then you can also <endOfText>
<bot>within the  first-aiders and the, and obviously to try and  try and drive it to them on that  issue.<endOfText>
<human>Well I did wanna follow this up with some other items <endOfText>
<bot>of a person and need to write how important it was, the little ones in the accident book, but looking in the erm  erm  the handbook for the company it says that an accident form should be filled in  and <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>handed to the Office Services Manager, so, that's not the procedure we follow at the moment is it?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Because I mean, I haven't seen an accident<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>form.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>So it's, what is the procedure?<endOfText>
<human>Is there a written procedure that says  if you deal with it then put it in the accident book?<endOfText>
<bot>Say, the first-aider's off sick<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>who's responsibility is it then?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Well the procedure is anything, that's if there's an accident which  does require treatment from the first-aiders, I mean then  I think we should send it off  don't you?<endOfText>
<human>So that means that<endOfText>
<bot>what we've had forms being filled in?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, in terms of the new issue of the handbook which is coming out in due course  , that's clarified<endOfText>
<bot>Oh right!<endOfText>
<human>and  I think it was one of things which never really took off in terms of the accident <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>book.<endOfText>
<bot>Well <endOfText>
<human>What <endOfText>
<bot>I was just looking for a reference <endOfText>
<human>for it, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>in terms of what should be reported and what shouldn't be?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos one of the things that I said, you know, just  when I was looking through the last  five or six months is that  it did seem  er, to be inconsistent in terms of certain areas like  the first floor, there's an awful lot of reporting going on  but, there was very little from the other, from the other areas.<endOfText>
<human>Erm  I  I, I think the same is the case  was that, you know<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Is there one book per floor?<endOfText>
<bot>Is that how it was?<endOfText>
<human>Is it one <endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>book per floor, is that how it works or <endOfText>
<bot>Just one book pe per first-aid room I think.<endOfText>
<human>So we've just got one book in the whole building.<endOfText>
<bot>Is that right?<endOfText>
<human>As far I know, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah that's right.<endOfText>
<human>That's a problem.<endOfText>
<bot>Maybe they can't find the book.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Well that's probably a good point actually really once you've only got a<endOfText>
<human>And course, we have more accidents in the  kitchen !<endOfText>
<bot>Right!<endOfText>
<human>No, no, I wasn't<endOfText>
<bot>I wasn't trying to !<endOfText>
<human>Yes, but  !<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, there are!<endOfText>
<human>Oh well, you might as well say that!<endOfText>
<bot>Yep?<endOfText>
<human>I don't mind.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, well let's perhaps look into that see whether.. there's a, a more appropriate way.<endOfText>
<human>Cos I know  the principle used to be that is er, it was in the first aid room  cos that's where all the first aid treatments <endOfText>
<bot>When you <endOfText>
<human>are based.<endOfText>
<bot>But then if there's no form <endOfText>
<human>to remind somebody they'll fill it in the accident <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>book, then it's gonna get forgo , forgotten from one day to the next.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that's what happened with this particular person as well.<endOfText>
<human>Because she's not been going to the first aid room.<endOfText>
<bot>She's not been going <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>there.<endOfText>
<human>So, she's writing them down, and then forgotten about them.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Okay, fine!<endOfText>
<bot>Well then look at that to see if there's a  more appropriate way of doing it.<endOfText>
<human>Shall I speak to Paula about that then?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Paula, and perhaps we'll bring it up in a first aid .<endOfText>
<bot>Get that easily.<endOfText>
<human>Well that was another thing, one of the new first-aiders we've got, erm  didn't know where the accident book was and I thought was quite an important thing that would probably have been brought up <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>at, at the initial training.<endOfText>
<bot>So<endOfText>
<human>Who's that?<endOfText>
<bot>Debbie  .<endOfText>
<human>Ah yes!<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>You know what I mean, that is down to the individual really is that er  that they should actually find out  and i , that needs to be highlighted to all <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>of them.<endOfText>
<bot>Well if there's only one for each building then<endOfText>
<human>Well perhaps when each new first-aider  qualifies they get like an induction pack or something.<endOfText>
<bot>Get a tour or <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>something !<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm mm.<endOfText>
<human>Are you intending approaching health and safety in  clients in the  Employee Handbook?<endOfText>
<bot>Er, yeah, and we're looking .<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Is it gonna very released t to everyone?<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>In due course.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>The section on health and safety could be  could be quite large especially in the light of further installation.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, we've actually  er, way we've designed is that erm, it's actually a sort of  , it's inserted in the ham handbook itself as actually a, sort of separate removal section so they can<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>use it sort of separately  .<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, in terms of the<endOfText>
<human>Literally  I think the only I said is the thing we get from the branches.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Well I think that<endOfText>
<bot>well needs a  I think one of the things we discussed in the branch action group meeting is actually, weren't quite sure what the  cos  we'd been sending out   for quite less than ten of the branches because  to  do something to them which was  mm  apparently lots of them in but erm  well they keep disappearing so that the  what we've been talking about is to try and get some points  erm  health and safety station  within the branch, which actually just has all this stuff for it.<endOfText>
<human>At least everybody knows where to go and  it's all there an but obviously that has some difficulty in terms of where to locate it and where to .<endOfText>
<bot>That's something to look at  .<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>In terms of actual accidents themselves, anybody  raising things or anything?<endOfText>
<human>I did erm, mention, I think on one of them which was the erm  Tim , this is the upstairs, I did actually mention that when I saw it to  to Roger.<endOfText>
<bot>He was very heroic, but erm  you probably did address <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>that one.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>If there's nothing, apart from that  we can move onto  first aid.<endOfText>
<bot>Suzanne anything?<endOfText>
<human>Not really, no<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>this time.<endOfText>
<bot>Any other issues in terms of first aid, Mark ?<endOfText>
<human>about first aid improving the<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Are we  i in terms of the first, first-aider availability does that tend to work?<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, in terms of people are aware that they can their first ai , where they can get first aid and  don't tend to have any reports these days.<endOfText>
<human>Well I think the erm  you said there was like a plan on each notice board with first-aiders and fire wardens on each floor<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>but they look a bit out of date at the moment.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>They're constantly<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>But certainly when we first went into first aid and we used to get regular calls in personnel all about, oh where's the first aid ?<endOfText>
<bot>But since it happened, in these days<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>people seem to finding  the sort of first-aider.<endOfText>
<human>I think we've got quite an extensive coverage now.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>Right, if we move onto fire.<endOfText>
<bot>Who's in charge of fire?<endOfText>
<human>Jonathan!<endOfText>
<bot>What, you want one?<endOfText>
<human>I've got nothing other,I don't know whether anybody's aware of what went on last Wednesday and probably that, I mean there could have been  there was a, sort of a, a cable that, a mains cable that heated up and started smoking  and er, we had to deal with that.<endOfText>
<bot>But erm, fortunately it didn't heat up, but we're looking at  erm, it didn't catch fire, but we're looking at er er, some safety features that we may actually have to install in the plant room  to erm  to actually identify these  these problems er, somewhat earlier.<endOfText>
<human>It was just happened to be spotted by Richard , fortunately, whilst he was  erm, between jobs and actually being up a  steps, walked in a saw the smoke coming out of one of the er, main switch  areas.<endOfText>
<bot>At that stage he didn't seem to have any effect on anything in terms of erm, alerting  anybody, so erm  we need to er, we need to deal with that with more action than we ha have at the moment.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Actually, I I think you're all aware of, that we caused some number of issues on that Wednesday afternoon  and for that half of our systems.<endOfText>
<human>I suppose it erm  did widen so , the  the wider view on that  is at  that it is important that we carry out the possible appliance testing on a regular basis.<endOfText>
<bot>This, this could have led, led to a very nasty electrical fire!<endOfText>
<human>Erm  and, to that extent, I'll reiterate, that we are in fact  working our way through  all of the <endOfText>
<bot>the electrical equipment in the building  in terms of appliance testing and the like.<endOfText>
<human>We're also, Mark, reviewing our preventative, our maintenance systems  erm, and we may , excuse me!<endOfText>
<bot>We may well  be extending the number of er  shut downs that we over the weekend so that we can carry out more extensive  maintenance on the electrical systems  around the organization.<endOfText>
<human>Certainly bits that look pretty interesting  I should imagine  and a report on the end of the day with a number of er  proposals  and actions for er  hopefully, preventing this happening again.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I think it just erm  also demonstrates our dependence on the  bigger systems in that regard.<endOfText>
<bot>Or we tend to <endOfText>
<human>Yes it does!<endOfText>
<bot>grind to a halt !<endOfText>
<human>But not , but not as much as on the electrical systems.<endOfText>
<bot>Well no!<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>I would think Mark knows that!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah , I was  er   being naive and thinking of them, in the same capacity <endOfText>
<bot>actually Norman, though I'm not  terribly  precise in my technical  technical .<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Good!<endOfText>
<human>Any other <endOfText>
<bot>On that point I've got<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>quite a few, dare I start with <endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>them?<endOfText>
<human>Erm<endOfText>
<bot>hiding them from !<endOfText>
<human>Erm  apparently there was a training course held on the twenty eighth of Jan erm  the procedures were actually out of date at that time, and Mike on security?<endOfText>
<bot>Is he the head the  fire<endOfText>
<human>The deputy.<endOfText>
<bot>Mike is, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>the deputy , he's actually going to <endOfText>
<bot>He's  <endOfText>
<human>issue erm  the floor plans  erm  and procedures to everyone which  they still haven't received.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm<endOfText>
<human>Will that be, will that   please?<endOfText>
<bot>I don't really know who yo to direct to  cos  do the fire marshals not meet regularly?<endOfText>
<human>Only to try and  <endOfText>
<bot>Probably we should organize it.<endOfText>
<human>I think they, no.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Erm  another thing on the erm  fire warden training it was stated the company did not want  erm, fire wardens to use the equipment  around the building, whereas the notices say  actually states, erm, attack fire if possible with appliances provided without taking personal risk.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, but the training contradicted that and said that they  they showed them how they should be used, but, but they  shouldn't tackle a fire  and they <endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>wanted to know which<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>they should be doing.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Ya.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Like she says  I think the position is exes effectively what we're trying to reinforce is that we don't want any heros<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>in a sense of  leaping into the flames and trying to battle with it.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, but obviously if somebody can take some assertive action  that stops the fire  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>down and that's a difficult  that's a judgement that  have to make.<endOfText>
<human>And clearly, in terms of the fires as a particular  the rationale for them being there is to  <endOfText>
<bot>can get out of the building, which is why <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>the position of our doors  are attached to the system is the  fire exit's actually blocked, by fire  and that's their only exit at least you got some opportunity to  .<endOfText>
<human>You was quite right.<endOfText>
<bot>You said I can do with some clarification which we  seek to do.<endOfText>
<human>Erm<endOfText>
<bot>So, are the fire appliances only supposed to be used by the <endOfText>
<human>by the wardens then?<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Is that not sort of I mean, I wasn't aware that anybody wasn't  supposed to pick up a fire appliance  or not.<endOfText>
<bot>Again, it's a similar sort of issue which is  it's it is difficult to put across that  if you notice you haven't got a fire warden there and that's your only <endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>exit, then you use the fire<endOfText>
<human>fire, fire extinguisher.<endOfText>
<bot>Though obviously one of the things that you worry about with fire extinguishers are you using the right one  with the correct <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>sort of fire?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, you can cause as much, or more damage to yourself or equipment in ter , by using the wrong one.<endOfText>
<bot>Service is done   <endOfText>
<human>Right, I mean the point I was making, I don't think there's anywhere <endOfText>
<bot>where you have said positively don't use a fire extinguisher <endOfText>
<human>No it's <endOfText>
<bot>in the event of bomb.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>I I think it would be crazy to actually say that positively.<endOfText>
<human>I mean people  it is question of how you say you well enough that <endOfText>
<bot>Aha.<endOfText>
<human>people do understand that there ar ,if there's a problem and you can do something about it without being a hero, as Mark said  then something should be done.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  but how you legislate for common sense and so on <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>I know that looking for a Purple Heart, or  V C, erm are   but I do believe it needs to be  it needs to be clarified.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, well I will se , I'll I'll seek to clarify tha to be able to join that to er sort of form of words.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, something that was actually also raised before and after working hours, erm, there was a fire  evacuation, I think, in October  about to quarter nine<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>erm<endOfText>
<bot>In G P House?<endOfText>
<human>Yep.<endOfText>
<bot>which was, complete chaos apparently!<endOfText>
<human>All rushing around <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>erm<endOfText>
<bot>That's happened.<endOfText>
<human>what are the procedures then if fire wardens aren't there?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, check it, as in  for checking buildings and  erm <endOfText>
<human>I didn't think it was chaos!<endOfText>
<bot>I thought it was quite well organized considering.<endOfText>
<human>Apart from all the people didn't come out.<endOfText>
<bot>Half the, yes <endOfText>
<human>Did they not?<endOfText>
<bot>yes, that was the main thing!<endOfText>
<human>The ones that I saw were.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Did the alarms  <endOfText>
<bot>!<endOfText>
<human>Did the alarms actually keep ringing?<endOfText>
<bot>Actually organized it .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So they weren't switched off <endOfText>
<human>half way through?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah?<endOfText>
<human>They kept going?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, they did, definitely.<endOfText>
<human>For some time.<endOfText>
<bot>Right!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>It's a good point there!<endOfText>
<human>Develop a procedure for out of hours then.<endOfText>
<bot>And something  that was suggested by  fire wardens, that they could do a five or ten minute erm  presentation and could go round each floor  to make people aware that they are the  fire wardens, why we have to evacuate and the importance  erm <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>It's crafty  <endOfText>
<human>and just issue memos<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>which you can.<endOfText>
<bot>They've erm  volunteers to see if you can show this committee the presentation for the .<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>Is it actually ?<endOfText>
<human>Is that the sort of the general feeling towards <endOfText>
<bot>Erm, Bevan <endOfText>
<human>fire?<endOfText>
<bot>and Mark, he said it was suggested, and it was a general feeling that that would be more<endOfText>
<human>I haven't said that!<endOfText>
<bot>useful than issuing memos.<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes!<endOfText>
<bot>That's er, true.<endOfText>
<human>Gold star!<endOfText>
<bot>That's it.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>Actually, that out of hours issue probably pertains to first aid treatment as well doesn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Perhaps we ought to make people aware that, just coming along security isn't .<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Erm <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>That's a good point!<endOfText>
<bot>I could  if I just pick up one other point about  you know, like the  the non-standard  times, or the non-standard occasions  when we do fire evacuations currently  er, I don't know where we think the fire is but we all troop out via our normal  fire exits and to our normal assembly ports  erm, it maybe  men , maybe an idea to  do  some fire evacuations where we  stayed where the fire actually was and people have got to take  other  other routes to evacuate the building.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I think we can probably try blocking exit next and see what happens!<endOfText>
<bot>And not on the  as well!<endOfText>
<human>Well I'm a  da no, sorry!<endOfText>
<bot>I did get   and proved the place I've been going that actually more accidents due to blocking  and you sort of back up the stairs with you<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>yeah and create  accidents but erm  well perhaps we could do it in a sort of  floor by floor actually this<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>just your rear exits are blocked off  find more routes you know you can take, of course, without much potential danger.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>So, we'll do some thinking about that then.<endOfText>
<human>We <endOfText>
<bot>Wha <endOfText>
<human>also, Mark, need to able to bring out most of the computer people as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, and I know we tend to make allowances for the operations<endOfText>
<human>It's in their contract that is, if they get out <endOfText>
<bot>They go , they gotta hold especially and  try and get through !<endOfText>
<human>Like the Captain of the ship.<endOfText>
<bot>But I do believe  that we ought to be doing more in terms of making sure they do come out  erm  you know i , we know it's only a  a training exercise  even though you leave one or two in there, but I think we ought <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>to be drawing most of those people out.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Can we do a separate <endOfText>
<human>And we <endOfText>
<bot>we could do a separate exercise then couldn't we?<endOfText>
<human>We could, but I dunno how realistic it would be, I mean if there was, oh obviously it'll more realistic than doing nothing.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>But er  we need to be dragging those out at the same time as we're dragging everybody else out.<endOfText>
<bot>If it were real, it would happen.<endOfText>
<human>And I just feel, you know, that er<endOfText>
<bot>So I think it's part of the  the early morning  set up and we were actually gonna talk to Steve weren't we, about<endOfText>
<human>That's right.<endOfText>
<bot>About<endOfText>
<human>what they actually bother <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>coming out for?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And er <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah , I think you ought to take that up with Steve, cos I don't see why you should getting, taking people <endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>out  on the machines<endOfText>
<human>Oh no!<endOfText>
<bot>I mean a lot <endOfText>
<human>well afterwards <endOfText>
<bot>of people there's nothing apparent with them, apparent, then the machine would be er, would be   <endOfText>
<human>That's right.<endOfText>
<bot>And the machine can wait another ten, about ten minutes  <endOfText>
<human>Well, and that's a serious <endOfText>
<bot>Course not.<endOfText>
<human>and I think we've gotta reas , yeah  lus , leave it to Steve.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>You gonna pick that up with Steve?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I'll do that.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Is the fire wardens sort of aware  you know, which way they're meant to go if their, their exits they would normally are used are blocked?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, shouldn't we sort of going  well that area you <endOfText>
<human>That <endOfText>
<bot>start off with?<endOfText>
<human>I think that was th , one of the things raised, the procedures and floor plans<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>and the exits<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>and weren't actually er, correct, and some <endOfText>
<bot>Mm mm.<endOfText>
<human>weren't now being used so, I think once that's out of the way.<endOfText>
<bot>So, sorry, say it again!<endOfText>
<human>They will?<endOfText>
<bot>The floor plans that they were actually shown  on their training course were out of date for the procedures, so that's what my  whatever, erm security<endOfText>
<human>We don't actually know but we are <endOfText>
<bot>but we said  <endOfText>
<human>Oh right.<endOfText>
<bot>we're recor , addressing that once.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>That's a point  to what we are addressing and what we aren't.<endOfText>
<human>That's a very good point!<endOfText>
<bot>With exactly the same one, we <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>our floor plan is, because of the number of moves and so on we've gotta have<endOfText>
<human>Oh, this is where desk plan  <endOfText>
<bot>I'll wor , I'll work out the <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>with the exit?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>And all the exits are clearing off?<endOfText>
<human>All the exits at the moment.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes they are.<endOfText>
<human>Erm <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>nothing's changed there.<endOfText>
<bot>And  we  whenever we do layouts now as well we insure that  all fire exits are kept to  a minimum of one and half metres wide, er, in terms of main access ways.<endOfText>
<human>And, we're becoming more and more stringent on where people   pile  boxes and other  various items of rubbish.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  but  we need to get some plans up  together.<endOfText>
<human>I don't really  want to have   to do too many  commit myself till the ammunition's here, but we are in fact, actually er, addressing this  very specific issue.<endOfText>
<bot>Fe feel vulnerable for another, a number of reasons Mark in terms of updated floor plans<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>and  yes, we're doing something<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>to<endOfText>
<human>Cos I was asking, for a number of reasons I was asking for floor plans for our , you see.<endOfText>
<bot>Didn't seem to be there.<endOfText>
<human>I'll ask for information Norman.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I'm having trouble with my zip today!<endOfText>
<bot>Anyway  thought that'd be the general issue!<endOfText>
<human>Yep.<endOfText>
<bot>Can we go onto computer design then?<endOfText>
<human>Oh !<endOfText>
<bot>While you've got them out!<endOfText>
<human>No!<endOfText>
<bot>It was just someone got one <endOfText>
<human>We got the same taste in !<endOfText>
<bot>Cheeky sod!<endOfText>
<human>Well, you see!<endOfText>
<bot>You can get him some nice<endOfText>
<human>We well if we don't get the package  if <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>we get one Mark we're going to get one for the right reasons indeed.<endOfText>
<bot>There's a CAD system in your end isn't there?<endOfText>
<human>Yes there is.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, it's a very good one.<endOfText>
<human>We use it all the time.<endOfText>
<bot>Well<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>We've already beaten them.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, we have looked at, but erm<endOfText>
<bot>Very good part of the investigation.<endOfText>
<human>distributing one <endOfText>
<bot>But they won't share, you know what they're like in my team it's, it's<endOfText>
<human>Oh you don't mean it!<endOfText>
<bot>Told him you can use our plotter any <endOfText>
<human>Erm <endOfText>
<bot>time you like.<endOfText>
<human>It's it's <endOfText>
<bot>hold on a minute.<endOfText>
<human>Gee whizz!<endOfText>
<bot>One other thing is just to chase up procedures we're going to put on the  passes for attendants and visitors  and that still hasn't been done.<endOfText>
<human>And I've spoken to Paula since the last meeting and  and chase it but  it still hasn't been<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>We, we put together some sort of words on anyway, we've er<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But, not very far.<endOfText>
<human>Almost <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>You gave us five pages to get in one!<endOfText>
<bot>I gave you five pages, yeah but<endOfText>
<human>It is now a hell of a lot less!<endOfText>
<bot>I hope we can do other things.<endOfText>
<human>That's right.<endOfText>
<bot>Did a good a trade in restaurant.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Good!<endOfText>
<human>May I  make a, a separate point<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>that does link in with that  point that Dianne made?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  me , myself and Steve are currently working on  er, health and safety for contractors coming on site  purpose to work etcetera  and  one of reasons why  well he  than ever before on this,visi visitor's information when they're  on site on the back of cars  it would, it would have been a nice thing to do would have been to have joined the whole lot together.<endOfText>
<human>Erm  and, anyway, on the  health and safety contractors on site thing  Stuart  has actually read the documentation  and he's quite happy with it, and we're waiting for you and Martin to feed back as well on it.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Mm!<endOfText>
<bot>Well I was getting you back for one!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah !<endOfText>
<bot>Why not!<endOfText>
<human>Once we've done that perhaps we can  sit  this particular lay info information on the back of the card so we're covering <endOfText>
<bot>Excellent!<endOfText>
<human>all visitors.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Yep.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Anything on fire from anybody else?<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's move on to any other business.<endOfText>
<human>I've just got something well I'll take over.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Right, a little <endOfText>
<bot>Erm <endOfText>
<human>note here.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know if I was the only one that didn't receive the check list?<endOfText>
<human>I mean, has, has anyone else got these wo , it's off the last bulletin.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  the check list that I think Des  completes  is gonna go to Adees and<endOfText>
<human>Oh right.<endOfText>
<bot>there's the Health and Safety Committee.<endOfText>
<human>Has anyone else  received it?<endOfText>
<bot>No I haven't.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot><endOfText>
<human>of our officers who work in children's homes, we didn't sack anybody who was at the front line of s services and we certainly didn't expect other people to pay for our circus tickets.<endOfText>
<bot>didn't sack anybody <endOfText>
<human>We actually believe that the people of  would prefer prefer their money spending on the environment and front end services.<endOfText>
<bot>And we actually believe that it's the individual's power to choose.<endOfText>
<human>What is now worrying us extremely about Local Government in Britain, in any Labour Authority, which is spreading now like a cancer in , that officers are not trusted now to even take the sick list of decisions so there has to be another sub-committee.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, I'm not that rude as to say that's for the payment of allowances, but some people may say that.<endOfText>
<human>Officers are paid to implement  <endOfText>
<bot>you can speak in a second.<endOfText>
<human>Officers are paid to implement our policies.<endOfText>
<bot>They're certainly not paid to write Councillor  press releases<endOfText>
<human>here here<endOfText>
<bot>at least even I never stooped to sending a circular round Community and Environment saying we do not want the danger of officers actually talking to the public and if there's any credit, Councillor  got to have it.<endOfText>
<human>The power to choose, the power to choose, well if the power to choose in politics is about the Labour Party choosing their own candidate for the  by-election and then the National Party replacing that candidate, well that's a Party I don't want to be a party to and that's nothing that we would ever stoop to<endOfText>
<bot>We've got to make a quite simple decision.<endOfText>
<human>We believe as a Party that the power of this county be individual, that he or she should have the power to choose.<endOfText>
<bot>Not like the Labour Party, that we the Labour Party have the power to choose that you don't have the right to own.<endOfText>
<human>Councillor  <endOfText>
<bot>your  says three consecutive Governments, Conservative Governments in Britain have striven to give power to the people, the right to choose and the right to own.<endOfText>
<human>Let's just have a look at what you've actually achieved.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's look at your performance.<endOfText>
<human>And what a performance.<endOfText>
<bot>It's worthy of an oscar.<endOfText>
<human>This Government has managed to combine the worst qualities of scrooge, Shylock and Genghis khan.<endOfText>
<bot>The Tory manifesto of 1983 declared, we have a goal.<endOfText>
<human>It finished up it turned out to be an own goal.<endOfText>
<bot>Their statement in their manifesto says, we promise that we will make Britain the best housed nation in Europe.<endOfText>
<human>That was 1983. 1988 a Government report declared there was a million houses in Britain unfit for human habitation.<endOfText>
<bot>We spend less than most of the other European countries on housing.<endOfText>
<human>Public sector housing investment has been cut by seventy percent.<endOfText>
<bot>Some choice.<endOfText>
<human>This Government has decimated the housing stock of this country and the Tories in this Chamber dare to talk about the right to choose and the power to buy.<endOfText>
<bot>And Councillor  talked about the resol the question County Council about the Right to Buy and why have a number of houses been sold gone down.<endOfText>
<human>Two simple answers, one they're not there and B, people can't afford them.<endOfText>
<bot>I remind that we put in a housing investment bid for a hundred and twelve million pounds and were given the right to buy  thirteen million.<endOfText>
<human>Let's talk about the choice of the people that're homeless.<endOfText>
<bot>Why are there so many people homeless?<endOfText>
<human>I'll tell you why.<endOfText>
<bot>It's because of the inhumane way that this Government treats people who experience financial problems of any kind and those other problems associated with those matters.<endOfText>
<human>This Government has no time at all for the poor and even less time for people who become poor as a result of their savage policies, the policies which cause high interest rates, rising unemployment and all because of it's obsession with inflation.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's look at house building, and you want to sell houses.<endOfText>
<human>Well, if you want to sell houses, why have all the major building companies in this country announced the largest cuts in profits this decade?<endOfText>
<bot>Quite simply, because people cannot afford to buy them.<endOfText>
<human>Public sector housing, housing associations, building has been cut by two thirds.<endOfText>
<bot>Did you give the building companies the choice?<endOfText>
<human>Is that what you mean about choice?<endOfText>
<bot>Give a choice of losing, like  did, two hundred million pound.<endOfText>
<human>That's some choice under a Tory Government.<endOfText>
<bot>The Tories lied that we obstruct Council house sales.<endOfText>
<human>What's the point of advertising a porsche  if you don't have one?<endOfText>
<bot>Where are all the houses to sell?<endOfText>
<human>Simply they're not there.<endOfText>
<bot>We, as a Council, have sold fourteen and a half thousand, with no facilities to build.<endOfText>
<human>The Labour Government will put that right.<endOfText>
<bot>But where's choice there?<endOfText>
<human>Where is the individuals' right to own?<endOfText>
<bot>Let's talk about the plight of families.<endOfText>
<human>What's gonna be the case?<endOfText>
<bot>Because if we continue with the housing stock that we've got, then families living in high rise flats are never ever gonna have the opportunity to own their own house with a garden so the children can play.<endOfText>
<human>What choice is that?<endOfText>
<bot>What choice have you given to the hundred thousand people, hundred thousand people, whose mortgages have been repossessed, who have been made homeless by the policies of your Government?<endOfText>
<human>That's some choice.<endOfText>
<bot>What choice have you given to the seventy five families that tonight are in bed and breakfast in this city with children?<endOfText>
<human>What choice have they got?<endOfText>
<bot>What choice are you giving the nine and a half thousand people on our Council waiting list?<endOfText>
<human>And what chance have they got of getting a house?<endOfText>
<bot>If I lived in ,,,, ten years waiting list, ten years waiting list to have the opportunity, if there is an opportunity to come, to own or get a three bedroomed house.<endOfText>
<human>That's some choice.<endOfText>
<bot>It's costing half a million pounds this year to pay for bed and breakfast.<endOfText>
<human>How illogical it is.<endOfText>
<bot>Half a million pounds, if we were to be given the resources, would enable us, debt charge wise, to build two hundred and fifty family houses.<endOfText>
<human>What an illogical society it is, and what choice have we got?<endOfText>
<bot>I'll tell the people of  who has a real choice.<endOfText>
<human>It's the privileged few.<endOfText>
<bot>The poor or less well off who cannot afford private health and pay school fees.<endOfText>
<human>That's what choice means to people.<endOfText>
<bot>Tories are not the Party of choice and ownership but the Party of restrictions and repossessions.<endOfText>
<human>Choice for the rich means hobsons choice for the rest.<endOfText>
<bot>You mentioned environment, Councillor  and you've a Government white paper, a common inheritance.<endOfText>
<human>And I agree, the Government claims it's done a great deal for the environment.<endOfText>
<bot>Indeed it has, it's polluted the rivers, dumped toxic waste on our land, poisoned the air and poisoned the water.<endOfText>
<human>You also mention within your document the N H S. Well, let's just have a little word about the N H S. Let's talk about the dedic dedicated staff working in the N H S who have nothing to gain and everything to lose.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's ask the twelve nurses at  hospital how they feel about their own jobs.<endOfText>
<human>What choice did you give them?<endOfText>
<bot>What choice do you give the patients that can't use that ward that you've closed down?<endOfText>
<human>What choice have you given the patients who can't use the six other wards that you've closed down?<endOfText>
<bot>What choice have you given the million people who're on the waiting list for National Health Service?<endOfText>
<human>That's some choice.<endOfText>
<bot>The seven million pound cuts in the N H S service since the  Trust.<endOfText>
<human>Three hundred jobs're gonna go.<endOfText>
<bot>That's some choice.<endOfText>
<human>Keep your choices, we don't want them.<endOfText>
<bot>This Government does not give a damn about the despair and breakdown of family life.<endOfText>
<human>Their policies are causing this an sorry, their policies are causing, and this from the Party which are supposed to believe in the sanctity of family life.<endOfText>
<bot>We are certainly heading back to Victorian times on a tide of human misery.<endOfText>
<human>The economy.<endOfText>
<bot>What choice are you giving three million unemployed people?<endOfText>
<human>Two recessions within a ten year period.<endOfText>
<bot>What about the family living on Income Support, on poverty and deprivation?<endOfText>
<human>What choice do they have?<endOfText>
<bot>The old age pension that's gonna get two pound fifteen.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you very much.<endOfText>
<bot>Two pound fifteen.<endOfText>
<human>Two pound fifteen.<endOfText>
<bot>The Tory Government, my Lord Mayor, has for too long denied people the real choice.<endOfText>
<human>But if the Tories opposite truly believe that they are the poi Party of choice, then let them have the courage to call a General Election.<endOfText>
<bot>here here<endOfText>
<human>Give the people of  and this country the opportunity to show them what choice they're gonna make, and it won't be a Tory Government, it'll be a Labour Government.<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor <endOfText>
<human>Actually it's quite a good speech from my opposition colleague there, but it's total nonsense really.<endOfText>
<bot>It didn't do anything for the tenants of this city or didn't put any new proposals forward.<endOfText>
<human>It went straight away back to the old socialist ideology of fifty years ago.<endOfText>
<bot>The Party choose, my Lord Mayor, the right to own one of the fundamental principles of Conservative philosophy, just as just as with Labour philosit philosophy, Labour will choose and Labour will own.<endOfText>
<human>That's your philosophy.<endOfText>
<bot>Since the Tenants Right to Buy was first introduced in 1980 it's been constantly opposed by Labour and indeed the S L D who've taken their fat away.<endOfText>
<human>This is in marked contrast to the Conservative Government which has consistently supported policies to spread home ownership throughout the country, giving people the choice and the independence which home ownership brings.<endOfText>
<bot>But, my Lord Mayor, Labour were not to know in the early eighties how popular the Tenants Right to Buy would be.<endOfText>
<human>Over one point two million houses bought by Council tenants of their own free will, so much so, my Lord Mayor, that some Labour politicians have had no choice but to do a U turn and give their support to the Right to Buy.<endOfText>
<bot>My Lord Mayor, how could they not throw out their socialist ideology when so many Labour Councillors, Labour Councillors, were buying, and some in this very Chamber, were indeed buying their own Council house.<endOfText>
<human>It's now clear, my Lord Mayor, what the Labour Party has transferred has transferred it's opposition to Right to Buy in to opposition towards the new Rents to Mortgage.<endOfText>
<bot>Typically, ten years too late.<endOfText>
<human>We can see from Labour's amendment J that Councillor , as I said earlier, intends to go down the same old socialist way of providing the very type of housing that is currently failing  tenants.<endOfText>
<bot>Lord Mayor, the Labour Group in  have a way of bandying words about without any action.<endOfText>
<human>We've heard quite a bit of it tonight.<endOfText>
<bot>One word they particularly like is, consultation.<endOfText>
<human>I would like to ask the current, and I emphasise the current, housing chairman, how much consultation he is being offered to our tenants.<endOfText>
<bot>Has he for instance consulted them with their rights under the Tenants Charter?<endOfText>
<human>Has he consulted them on their right to choose another landlord under the Government's new Tenants Choice?<endOfText>
<bot>Has he asked indeed the tenants who have not already bought their home if they would be interested in the Government's Rent to Buy housing scheme?<endOfText>
<human>Has he consulted with tenants on the benefits of transferring their estates to housing associations?<endOfText>
<bot>My Lord Mayor, I think not.<endOfText>
<human>It's a sad indictment on our present housing chairman, when asked in committee about the changing roles of housing associations, he said, it's a bitter pill to swallow.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, my Lord Mayor, with that kind of thinking, what hope have our tenants of ever raising their quality of life in our badly thought out Council estates?<endOfText>
<human>Council housing, as we know it, is not the answer.<endOfText>
<bot>The role of Local Authorities as large scale landlords does simply not work.<endOfText>
<human>You only have to see some of  run down estates for the evidence.<endOfText>
<bot>It restricts the mobility of the family, it does not create pride of ownership, it does not give a sense of belonging within the community, it encourages crime and with the resultant loss of personal safety.<endOfText>
<human>The vast majority of people, Lord Mayor, Lord Mayor, the vast majority of people, the vast majority of people would wish to own their own home.<endOfText>
<bot>We are the only Party who believe that every family has the right to their own home.<endOfText>
<human>Finally, my Lord Mayor, I welcome I welcome and support our motion, quite clearly taken from the brilliant speech made by the Prime Minister at Conservative Party Conference, and when and when the Conservative Government is re-elected next year, we will give the people the power to choose and we will give the people the right to own.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you, my Lord Mayor.<endOfText>
<human>Councillor  <endOfText>
<bot>your lucky day.<endOfText>
<human>If I may start  excuse me, my Lord Mayor, by answering something that appears to be confusing the Conservative benches.<endOfText>
<bot>Despite my baby-faced good looks, I am actually old enough to remember 1979, I am also old enough to remember 1974, 1970, 1966, so I hope that's cleared up.<endOfText>
<human>I'm not gonna go back any further than that.<endOfText>
<bot>But it does seem to me that, can you really trust a front bench, that can't work out that I might be slightly over the age of twenty one?<endOfText>
<human>If you listen to what the Tories are actually saying, it's the same old I'm alright Jack mentality.<endOfText>
<bot>I can do it, I can afford it, I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna get it for me and devil take the .<endOfText>
<human>We've heard it all before.<endOfText>
<bot>We're gonna hear it time and time again in the run up to the Election.<endOfText>
<human>There was no mention of the rights of people to combine collectively to have their views represented, no where in that, it was all me me me.<endOfText>
<bot>The people at G C H Q, whose rights you lot took away, to joining Trade Unions, where are th where's their rights?<endOfText>
<human>Are you gonna restore them?<endOfText>
<bot>Is Councillor  gonna stand up and say that he believes in the right of people to join Trade Unions?<endOfText>
<human>I think not.<endOfText>
<bot>We we should discuss a bit about this document and I too have had the er dubious honour of reading John Major's speech and it's nice to see that both Tory speakers have actually managed to take half of it each and paraphrase it.<endOfText>
<human>I think they have a cheek to complain about people writing other people's press releases when they can't even write their own speeches, they just take a bit of their leaders and claim it as their own.<endOfText>
<bot>If you have ever actually looked at this document that they have produced for today's meeting, it is not a strategy, it's not a statement, it's just a trotting out of the old stories that have been knocked back time and time again, but if they're gonna bring it out, let's knock it back again.<endOfText>
<human>Let's look at some of the issues that aren't gonna be alluded to in other debates today.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's start off with tax.<endOfText>
<human>The Tories have cut int income tax.<endOfText>
<bot>Certainly, congratulations.<endOfText>
<human>They forget to mention a few other little things.<endOfText>
<bot>V A T has risen from eight percent to seventeen and a half percent.<endOfText>
<human>National, there is no choice in paying your electricity bill, your gas bill, your water rates, where V A T has gone up.<endOfText>
<bot>Don't talk to me about choice with that.<endOfText>
<human>National Insurance contributions have risen from six point five percent to nine percent and child benefit cuts have cost a family with two children a hundred and fifty four pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>There was no choice and you're taking away rights in that.<endOfText>
<human>The poorest people in the country have had their tax burden trebled since 1979 and the tax burden has increased, for the average family, from thirty two percent of their income to over thirty three percent.<endOfText>
<bot>Shareholding.<endOfText>
<human>Fine.<endOfText>
<bot>More people own shares but, as a percentage of the number of shares held, the individual shareholding has fallen from thirty percent in 1979 to eighteen percent today, and if all these shareholders c turned up to exercise their right and their power at the annual meeting of British Telecom or British Gas, or any other, to say, we think it's outrageous the sort of money that you are now paying your chairs and your directors, what would happen?<endOfText>
<human>They would be out-voted by the pension funds, the banks, the city institutions, the paymasters of the Tory Party.<endOfText>
<bot>We have heard a lot today about the  of the Trade Union.<endOfText>
<human>We've heard nothing about <endOfText>
<bot>their links with big business.<endOfText>
<human>Education.<endOfText>
<bot>The issue about assisted places in the C T C is irrelevant to a majority of the people out there.<endOfText>
<human>It's especially irrelevant as you didn't even seem to introduce them when you were in control.<endOfText>
<bot>We believe that people should have the choice and the choice and the rights that most people want is for their children to be educated in schools without water dripping down the walls, where the ceiling doesn't fall in, that doesn't rely on temporary classes.<endOfText>
<human>That's rights, that's choice.<endOfText>
<bot>If you're talking, if you're talking about L M S giving people rights and choice, you haven't spoken to that many heads because most heads wanna get on with the business of educating people, not being financial bureaucrats trying to balance inadequate school budgets.<endOfText>
<human>Most governors also have work to go to and we don't and we don't<endOfText>
<bot>I did not say that and you would know it, Councillor .<endOfText>
<human>Basically, what we are faced with here is the standard Tory lies, the standard Tory attempt to dig themselves out of their hole.<endOfText>
<bot>It's not a statement, it is a waste of paper and you should be ashamed to have bought it.<endOfText>
<human>The debate has now gone on for thirty minutes.<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor <endOfText>
<human>My Lord Mayor, I move under standing order A fifteen B that the vote now be put.<endOfText>
<bot>I so move Lord Mayor.<endOfText>
<human>Somebody get the other group back in?<endOfText>
<bot>Don't tell them<endOfText>
<human>That is carried by forty eight votes to twenty nine, forty eight in mi as a matt as a mere mathematician I think that's carried.<endOfText>
<bot>Those in favour of amendment F moved by Councillor  please show.<endOfText>
<human>I'm sorry, it's J, it's me that can't read properly.<endOfText>
<bot>That, that is carried by forty eight votes to twenty nine and now becomes a substantive motion.<endOfText>
<human>Those in favour of the substantive motion please show.<endOfText>
<bot>Those against?<endOfText>
<human>That is carried by forty eight votes to twenty nine<endOfText>
<bot>Move on to the next white paper motion on the Health Service Trust.<endOfText>
<human>Call upon Councillor  to move the motion.<endOfText>
<bot>So moved, Lord Mayor<endOfText>
<human>Seconded?<endOfText>
<bot>Call upon Councillor  to move amendment L standing in his name.<endOfText>
<human>Is there a seconder?<endOfText>
<bot>Seconded Lord Mayor<endOfText>
<human>Call upon Councillor  to move amendment M standing in his name.<endOfText>
<bot>Is there a seconder?<endOfText>
<human>Seconded Lord Mayor<endOfText>
<bot>In accordance with standing order A thirteen little C this motion will stand referred to the Social Services Committee for consideration and report unless the Council decided to deal with it at this meeting.<endOfText>
<human>What are the Council's wishes?<endOfText>
<bot>That the Council deal with it at this meeting<endOfText>
<human>Those in favour?<endOfText>
<bot>Unanimous.<endOfText>
<human>Councillor <endOfText>
<bot>I think I ought to remind you, all of us, the three basic principles of the National Health Service.<endOfText>
<human>One, that is should be free at the point of service.<endOfText>
<bot>Two, that treatment offered should be on a basis of need and not ability to pay and thirdly, that it should be a comprehensive service for all people whatever background they come from.<endOfText>
<human>That's something that I strongly support and my Party does, and I believe a vast majority of the country support.<endOfText>
<bot>There's been much debate recently about whether the Tories are going to privatise the Health Service in the future.<endOfText>
<human>I think it's actually a waste of time discussing that because they are already privatising the Health Service.<endOfText>
<bot>Free at the point of service.<endOfText>
<human>One in nine of the operations carried out in the  region now are done privately, and that's actually one in three in some parts of .<endOfText>
<bot>That's not free at the point of service.<endOfText>
<human>Private hospitals are actually gonna charge women from outside  sixty pounds for osteoporosis screening.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that's disgusting and certainly it's not free at the point of service.<endOfText>
<human>The Government to introduce charges for eye tests and since then three million less eye tests have been carried out.<endOfText>
<bot>Short term cuts, long term misery, and more problems for the Health Service.<endOfText>
<human>That's not free at the point of service.<endOfText>
<bot>What about treatment on the basis of need?<endOfText>
<human>Surgeons in  are being told to do less emergency operations because of the extra costs involved and in  surgeons are ordered to give priority to patients who come from G P budget holders because there's more money coming from those budget holders, nothing to do with basis of need.<endOfText>
<bot>A comprehensive service.<endOfText>
<human>You look at , they've transferred all their long term N H S care for the elderly to private nursing homes.<endOfText>
<bot>Where's the power to choose for those elderly people that want free at the point of service National Health Service treatment?<endOfText>
<human>It was, or it has been, a belief that the N H S was for all of us from the cradle to the grave.<endOfText>
<bot>It's now a sick joke in the Health Service, it's from the cradle to the Waldergrave.<endOfText>
<human>The  Trusts are in serious financial difficulties and may well be one million pound or two million pound in debt before the end of this financial year.<endOfText>
<bot>And quite rightly, it's gonna be the subject of a Parliamentary Health Select Committee Enquiry which starts next week.<endOfText>
<human>Meanwhile, it's chief executive, it's brains, it's driving force, is getting out.<endOfText>
<bot>He says, quote, there's unfish unfinished business for the Trust but not for me.<endOfText>
<human>And he's so desperate to get out he'll take a twenty thousand pound a year pay cut.<endOfText>
<bot>He's obviously abandoning the sinking ship cos he knows what's happening to it.<endOfText>
<human>Now what effect is that gonna have on the staff who can't leave?<endOfText>
<bot>Having said that, three hundred are been forced to leave, three hundred are being sacked, as we've heard before.<endOfText>
<human>Nurses are actually being sacked at .<endOfText>
<bot>The official term is released, not sacked, released, made redundant.<endOfText>
<human>But that's been consistent because there are three thousand less nurses this year in the N H S than there were last year.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't believe that's because people are being treated better, or more people are being treated better, but at a cost of eighty million pound, there are four thousand more managers or accountants, people brought in<endOfText>
<human>Under Labour it was cut by five percent.<endOfText>
<bot>Doctors pay is up thirty nine percent after inflation, under Labour it was cut by seventeen percent.<endOfText>
<human>The Party that are the bastions of the Health Service.<endOfText>
<bot>Just over one million additional hospital cases were treated in 1989, compared with seventy eight.<endOfText>
<human>The number of in- patients treated has increased by one point two million.<endOfText>
<bot>Waiting lists have risen, as Councillor  has already said, under every Labour Government, and fallen under every Conservative Government since the N H S was founded.<endOfText>
<human>That is fact.<endOfText>
<bot>That is fact.<endOfText>
<human>It's ten o'clock.<endOfText>
<bot>That is fact Lord Mayor and these facts will bear out.<endOfText>
<human>I challenge Councillor  to bring me the evidence saying otherwise.<endOfText>
<bot>So<endOfText>
<human>if it's doing so well, oh and you wouldn't have been on that long under a Labour Government, of course, it would've been jobs for the boys, they'd've slipped you in I'm sure.<endOfText>
<bot>So why do the Conservatives want to make changes then if we've got such a good record on health?<endOfText>
<human>The answer, as we have always said, is that there are always ways of improving services in addition to putting more money in.<endOfText>
<bot>This is where we differ from the Labour Party, whose answer is always more money, more money, more money.<endOfText>
<human>The Conservative philosophy is not just to increase spending.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's be more efficient and make the tax payers' money be used wisely.<endOfText>
<human>Let's take a look at the changes the Trusts, under N H S Trusts, staff can adapt their services more easily to suit the needs of local people.<endOfText>
<bot>I thought this was what some of your policy was supposed to be all about.<endOfText>
<human>They can decide their own management and staffing structures, capital programmes and pay and conditions, except those of junior doctors.<endOfText>
<bot>There is nothing unusual in the idea of hospitals managing themselves.<endOfText>
<human>It was only in 1974 that teaching hospitals were brought under Health Authority control.<endOfText>
<bot>Although Trusts only came into operation in April ninety one, the evidence suggests that many, that many have improved patient services in many w many areas waiting lists have been cut through greater efficiency and increased use of day surgery.<endOfText>
<human>The organisation  and Company produced a report on N H S Trusts based on discussions with nearly sixty percent of the chief execs of the first wave.<endOfText>
<bot>It said, the key finding of the survey is that an overwhelming majority of the Trusts are reporting an improved performance.<endOfText>
<human>On the eighteenth of August the Sunday Times published a survey of twenty five of the biggest Trust hospitals.<endOfText>
<bot>It concluded more patients were being treated and waiting times had been cut.<endOfText>
<human>So what of Labour's scare tactics of privatisation?<endOfText>
<bot>I'll quote you from the Daily Telegraph<endOfText>
<human>That, that totally, just like the T and A, that totally unbiased paper.<endOfText>
<bot>Lie is a nasty word.<endOfText>
<human>Lie is a nasty word and those in politics ten who use it tend to get hit by it on the rebound.<endOfText>
<bot>Labour has been saying something it knows to be untrue.<endOfText>
<human>This is Mister Kinnock's words, that the Tories will privatise the Health Service.<endOfText>
<bot>That seems to me to qualify as a false statement made with the intention of dise deceiving which is how the dictionary defines a lie.<endOfText>
<human>The Labour Party pose as the guardian of the N H S but when pressed they've not policies, only empty promises, no idea where the funding would come fo from to pay for their ill thought out pledges.<endOfText>
<bot>Robin Cook, that great man the opposition, of the opposition, an immediate, well then let me quote ya, let me quote ya.<endOfText>
<human>I'm I'm pleased it's flavour of the month because it's just going to show you all when w when you listen to his words.<endOfText>
<bot>An immediate halt to the Government's Hospital Trust Programme and a long term commitment to restore N H S funding was promised yesterday by Robin Cook.<endOfText>
<human>But Mister Cook, health spokesman, declined to say how much extra money he thought the N H S needed, or the amount the future Labour Chancellor would be prepared to find.<endOfText>
<bot>An immediate halt to the Government's Hospital Trust, sorry I'm reading the same thing again.<endOfText>
<human>The N H S will not be privatised under Conservatives, it will prosper from the reforms taking place.<endOfText>
<bot>Finally, Lord Mayor, I believe everything I've said.<endOfText>
<human>I believe that the Labour Party know this is a lie.<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor  has put this motion in.<endOfText>
<human>No, it's your policy that if you tell the lie often enough people people believe it.<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor , well well we'll find out, Councillor  has put this motion in, I've wound it up Lord Mayor, I'll challenge him or any of his team to a public debate where we can look at the record about, name your place, name your time, I will, I will debate with you in public Councillor  on our record of reforms and the Health Service.<endOfText>
<human>In return you must promise Council or  that you will outline to the people of  the Labour Party's plans for the N H S, and state where you will get the funding from.<endOfText>
<bot>It's time to put up or shut up Councillor .<endOfText>
<human>My Lord Mayor I move under standing order A fifteen B that the vote now be put.<endOfText>
<bot>I so move, Lord Mayor.<endOfText>
<human>Just a minute.<endOfText>
<bot>Before you before you all vote.<endOfText>
<human>Put your hands down a minute.<endOfText>
<bot>I want to remind you that those who have declared an interest should not vote.<endOfText>
<human>Those in favour.<endOfText>
<bot>Those against?<endOfText>
<human>Mhm?<endOfText>
<bot>that's lost, forty eight, twenty six <endOfText>
<human>That is lost by twenty eight to forty six.<endOfText>
<bot>Those in favour of amendment L moved by Councillor .<endOfText>
<human>Two.<endOfText>
<bot>Those against?<endOfText>
<human>Well it's obviously lost.<endOfText>
<bot>Those in favour of the substantive motion please show.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm?<endOfText>
<bot>Forty four now .<endOfText>
<human>Those against?<endOfText>
<bot>That is carried, forty four votes to thirty.<endOfText>
<human>I now move on to black paper motion number six, Euro Cities.<endOfText>
<bot>Call upon Councillor  to move the motion.<endOfText>
<human>Call upon Councillor  to move amendment N standing in his name.<endOfText>
<bot>I move Lord Mayor<endOfText>
<human>Seconded?<endOfText>
<bot>Seconded Lord Mayor<endOfText>
<human>In accordance with standing order A thirteen little C this motion will stand referred to the Community and Environment Services Committee for consideration and report unless the Council decided to deal with it at this meeting.<endOfText>
<bot>What are the Council's wishes?<endOfText>
<human>I propose it be debated at this meeting Lord Mayor<endOfText>
<bot>Seconded?<endOfText>
<human>Seconded Lord Mayor<endOfText>
<bot>All those in favour?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, ok.<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor <endOfText>
<human>I haven't started, I haven't started yet, just let me get it out my system.<endOfText>
<bot>Are ya, are ya settled now?<endOfText>
<human>Are you settled?<endOfText>
<bot>Are you settled?<endOfText>
<human>Right, right.<endOfText>
<bot>Monsieur Le Mayor.<endOfText>
<human>Signor <endOfText>
<bot>My Lord Mayor, in case you hadn't noticed, foreign languages.<endOfText>
<human>But not foreign languages that are not new to .<endOfText>
<bot>There's a serious, a serious side Lord Mayor, to that greeting cos I just looked at the number of companies that are owned this shareholders scheme that they like to promote, the number of  companies that're owned by foreign nationals.<endOfText>
<human>of  owned by the Swiss,, owned by the Germans,, owned by German, a large number of companies under foreign ownership.<endOfText>
<bot>One reason, one major reason why  got to play a pa a role in Europe, to po protect the interests of the work force within  and I make no apologies for any of the visits that any of our members have been on because they've all been worthwhile.<endOfText>
<human>and you know, tonight, tonight, tonight I wanted to, I wanted to have a knock about with my old sparring partner but he's ill, he's very ill from what I've heard tonight and he should go see a doctor.<endOfText>
<bot>Because, because Councillor  don't take my advice tonight, and I never thought I'd be thankful to  but take advantage of what  says what you should do.<endOfText>
<human>Something about casseroles, I don't understand that.<endOfText>
<bot>But the Euro Cities and the position of  in Europe is of tremendous importance because of the failure of your Government to recognise the needs of this district and the nis needs of this region.<endOfText>
<human>We've heard, so eloquently said by many of my comrades tonight, about the problems right across the sectors affecting  and I congratulate each and every one on their contribution tonight.<endOfText>
<bot>We're not gonna waste time explaining things to you and fortunately, through our friends, through out friends in the T and A, we don't have to waste time.<endOfText>
<human>The message gets out.<endOfText>
<bot>There's many factors, many factors, and I'd like to pay congratulations to Councillor  I think it was, or the member certainly that came to the Economic er Sub-committee that discussed the European report back because there we did have a proper discussion about the value of those trips.<endOfText>
<human>But for those that weren't there, let me explains some of the good reasons why we're involved.<endOfText>
<bot>Evidence of the European Commission experts that strategic alliance between cities are likely to form the basis of future business links.<endOfText>
<human>Action endorsed by our own Chamber of Commerce and by our own business leaders in this city on the visits that we took place.<endOfText>
<bot>previous track record in Europe, and Councillor , you can't have it both ways.<endOfText>
<human>You claim on the one hand how wonderful you were in securing grants for  under the I D O. You actually sold this city short because you went for the I D O without making sure that your Government paid the extra money that robbed that robbed<endOfText>
<bot>that robbed social services, education and housing.<endOfText>
<human>You know it's true.<endOfText>
<bot>The first visit to Brussels, the amend , the first visit to Brussels we had to go and bail you out because the Commission, the Commission, we could have been in this  er<endOfText>
<human>the Commission were gonna pull the plug on  because of your failure while you were in control to adhere to the programme<endOfText>
<bot>here here<endOfText>
<human>to adhere to the programme because the newly privatised the newly privatised Water Authority and British Rail couldn't affo couldn't afford the finance to put their share in to the grants from Brussels.<endOfText>
<bot>That's what happened, so that's a reality.<endOfText>
<human>You're a wonderful s you're a wonderful speaker but wait til I've finished.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>The position on Euro Cities also is that we , and unfortunately  are the leading European cities that are involved in promoting good initiatives on the expertise of what exists within , be it economic development, be it equal opportunities policies, we are promoting this city and the benefit of getting those grants and having those foresight of putting officers into Brussels means that  is being invited by other cities within Europe and Eastern Europe to develop links based on what our expertise is.<endOfText>
<bot>Because the difference between us and the Tories is when we mean we support for Eastern Europe, we don't just talk about it glibly, we go there and we do it because we see the future of Europe being the future of our own people here in .<endOfText>
<human>Sixty million pounds this Council has got out of Europe.<endOfText>
<bot>The costs of the trips.<endOfText>
<human>Brussels related, the cost of the trips, less than one percent.<endOfText>
<bot>A nonsense view to attack that.<endOfText>
<human>But then listening, listening to what you've been attacking tonight, I'm very sad really that that's all you've got to offer.<endOfText>
<bot>A weak Tory group that doesn't say anything positive about anything.<endOfText>
<human>That has a go, an attack, about everything because you've been rejected so many times, so many times, and will continue to be rejected when we get the next election that you're frightened to death to have.<endOfText>
<bot>Opting out of hospitals of the N H S, opting skills out of L M S and trying to opt out of Europe.<endOfText>
<human>I hope you I hope you get better.<endOfText>
<bot>Bye.<endOfText>
<human>I didn't realise it were that exciting.<endOfText>
<bot>Going back to what I was saying.<endOfText>
<human>Opting out of schools, opting out of the N H S and trying to opt out of Europe, but what you forgot is that your leader signed a document that says you can't opt out of Europe.<endOfText>
<bot>You can argue about single currency but you can't opt out of the European Single Market.<endOfText>
<human>And that's a serious side to  cos if we in  Council don't lead the way to the way that we're trying through the Euro Cities by offering what's good in  to Europe, developing those links so that we can share them with the  community here and other cultural links, then we're doing  a dis- service.<endOfText>
<bot>We've got a grant of sixty million.<endOfText>
<human>We're able to entice further revenue out of Brussels with the support of the private sector.<endOfText>
<bot>And they're not having a go, they're not having a go, they're saying what can we do to assist?<endOfText>
<human>Can we go with ya?<endOfText>
<bot>They're talking about going with us certainly, but they're doing it in a positive way because they see what the future is.<endOfText>
<human>You're trying to shut your eyes to 1993, that's what you're trying to do, and you're trying to pull the rest of us down with it, well it ain't gonna happen.<endOfText>
<bot>The next steps, cos we aren't gonna be frightened by your tinpot threats about y'know, junketing etcetera.<endOfText>
<human>It's no fun for me to be away from my family, away from home.<endOfText>
<bot>It's no fun for my colleagues to be away.<endOfText>
<human>But what we do, what we do is put  first, do it properly.<endOfText>
<bot>Many European cities, many European cities are making great efforts, Strasbourg, Brussels, Barcelona, leading cities within Europe.<endOfText>
<human>I'm proud that  name's up there.<endOfText>
<bot>A video was done about European funding.<endOfText>
<human>was in there, in that video.<endOfText>
<bot>The fact a small region, and we call ourselves a region, that's how we got the grants, we now see ourselves developing to support our colleagues in  and see the need for a strong regional approach which my colleague will mention later.<endOfText>
<human>It's important to this city, both in a financial way, in a cultural way, in the development of the human race, that we make Europe work.<endOfText>
<bot>You've turned us that route because your Government have switched away from what matters from British people that we represent.<endOfText>
<human>Not from those that've got the money to choose, as my colleagues have said, but for those that need to develop and have the opportunity to develop further.<endOfText>
<bot>I believe that your amendment is typical of the way you've contributed tonight, that you're not really sure for certain about what you're saying and why you're saying it.<endOfText>
<human>Public debates, Councillor , well I'll have any of ya.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll probably debate anywhere on  contribution within Europe.<endOfText>
<human>Any format, any format.<endOfText>
<bot>And then you try to turn the argument about attacks on individuals.<endOfText>
<human>Public debate is what it's all about.<endOfText>
<bot>We've had that public debate and we've got the support from the people of  for what we're doing within Europe.<endOfText>
<human>There's a long way to go because many of these companies that we've mentioned are gonna fight fierce competition from Europe and we need to assist them.<endOfText>
<bot>They've not looked hasn't British industry because of the attacks it's been under on what Europe has to offer in terms of better training, better health and safety etcetera and we need to bring that information to them.<endOfText>
<human>I'm sure that er those thinking members that are left within the Tory group, if there are any thinking members left, will realise the benefits of what we're about and will support the future economic strategy that this Council needs to adopt.<endOfText>
<bot>So I have pleasure in putting the record straight.<endOfText>
<human>I'm not gonna indulge  about politics with the  of Europe, I believe that what we're saying is the right way forward and I hope you'll wholeheartedly support our resolution.<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor  <endOfText>
<human>the E E C's Euro Citizens Initiative.<endOfText>
<bot>We should ask ourselves, are we a country of opportunists?<endOfText>
<human>And without a doubt our history, the commonwealth of nations and business acumen prove this.<endOfText>
<bot>We can develop in Europe only within the guidelines set out by Central Government, a Government quite clear that a joining of the attitudes and minds is desirable, not federalism.<endOfText>
<human>The  and their self-opinionated Premier, Jacques Delores, must be told clearly that we stand for co-operation of Western style democracy, not the old Eastern block style of all encompassing socialist state with the dead hand of Brussels directing policies, as Moscow did with the U S S R. Freedom of the independent nation and people must confer.<endOfText>
<bot>My Lord Mayor, after setting the parameters, I do feel that  can continue it's good relations with our other cities and use Brussels as a tool to this end.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, Euro Cities is an organisation of Brussels but it must not be allowed to dominate the proceedings and massage and manage the cities.<endOfText>
<bot>It must be free city to city co-operation within a loose association with Brussels.<endOfText>
<human>We have seen the stupidity of the E E C agriculture programme.<endOfText>
<bot>This must be avoided in Euro Cities.<endOfText>
<human>Euro Cities can be a sound tool for co-operation and our officers must be at the forefront with the Chambers of Trade of Commerce, and  Development Association and all, all of which have expertise in Europe.<endOfText>
<bot>Both agencies that the chief executive's office refers to frequently.<endOfText>
<human>However, we must ask, what of our Euro M P's?<endOfText>
<bot>There seems to be little work from the Labour local member.<endOfText>
<human>Perhaps this is why, in addition to officers attending meetings, Labour Councillors need to improve their self indulgence by going into Europe on junkets.<endOfText>
<bot>There are issues across Europe that we need to be aware of as a city.<endOfText>
<human>However, we need to conserve financial prudence and only send members occasionally, with officers more frequently.<endOfText>
<bot>We need to liaise with Europe as a city but there must be three provisos.<endOfText>
<human>One, that we ca that we only go when a clear brief from Brussels officers cannot be established, and not a trip just for the lads which was reminiscent of the last hastily organised trips.<endOfText>
<bot>Two, that we do not become wrapped up in the Bureaucratic socialism of Brussels and that true entrepreneur spirit is encouraged between cities.<endOfText>
<human>And three, that financial prudence and co- operation with the private sector are adopted for the good of our city.<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor , we all remember 1983 when Labour voted to withdraw from Europe and then wanted to re-negotiate in 1984.<endOfText>
<human>This is the Party who are now playing the Euro card with cynicism.<endOfText>
<bot>Labour are in, Labour are out, or is it now, how best can they play to win votes?<endOfText>
<human>here here<endOfText>
<bot>My Lord Mayor, at the Economic Strategy Sub-committee meeting recently, we were asked to adopt from Florence, an objective two statement which was not clear and did not translate precisely.<endOfText>
<human>It is typical of the controlling group's over enthusiasm for the photo press opportunity that they're anxious to sign anything, even if the policies are not clear.<endOfText>
<bot>With reference to the Euro visits in September, thirteen trips since last summer to Europe.<endOfText>
<human>Seven Labour Councillors and twenty three officers, cutting twenty three thousand pounds of Charge payers' money is totally unnecessary when liaison groups already exist within the chief executive's office, the  Development Association and the  Regional Association, on which we all have representatives.<endOfText>
<bot>If Labour had supported our idea  in it's early stage, we would now have spent over seventy percent of the funds available in the five year cycle.<endOfText>
<human>here here<endOfText>
<bot>Not the miserable thirty four percent spent at the moment, all due to Labour slowing down the regeneration of our district by delaying financial support.<endOfText>
<human>Officers need to correlate information and if visits are necessary they should decide, with the chief executive's support, the need to visit Europe, not Labour Councillors on a junket costing twenty thousand out of the pockets of our Charge payers.<endOfText>
<bot>We support liaison but not self indulgence by Labour Councillors.<endOfText>
<human>Even that auguste paper, the T and A, in the editorial, recently stated, we cannot afford the extravagance of going along just to see the party, just to be at the party.<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor  must also remember that , and other major companies have a overseas branches of their company.<endOfText>
<human>It is not just a one-way traffic as he tried to er indicate.<endOfText>
<bot>We have no objection to the principle of a motion on involvement across Europe, especially following our recent friend's city's re-emergence into democracy as both of us can benefit from future E C funds.<endOfText>
<human>However, we need to be satisfied that members' visits are essential and we will ensure that the details behind Labour's motion are monitored closely.<endOfText>
<bot>We have officer liaison groups.<endOfText>
<human>Let them get on with it and use their capabilities to the full.<endOfText>
<bot>We, as members, should not sit on their desks and tell them exactly where to go.<endOfText>
<human>That is why we put forward our amendment and hope against all hope that Labour may see the light and vote with us on our amendment.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you Lord Mayor.<endOfText>
<human>Councillor <endOfText>
<bot>Thank you Lord Mayor.<endOfText>
<human>is a European city, but not just that, is a city that leads in Europe.<endOfText>
<bot>It's a city because of it's rich cultural heritage and it's expertise in Local Government affairs that has much to offer those emerging local democracies in Eastern Europe.<endOfText>
<human>And yes, we can teach them about partnership, Councillor  and I think it's hypocrisy for the Tories to talk about links with the private sector.<endOfText>
<bot>The private sector didn't know where you were for two years.<endOfText>
<human>I've got a very interesting quote here.<endOfText>
<bot>The scale of our achievement is a result of a great deal of hard work on the part of officers and Councillors.<endOfText>
<human>We had the foresight to assess the situation and successfully sell  case.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, I I could have said that but of course it was Councillor .<endOfText>
<human>But there is a new situation emerging because the speakers on the opposite side seem to have forgotten what's happened in the last two years in Eastern Europe and the European map is getting wider.<endOfText>
<bot>Lord Mayor, I'd like to get beyond the hype and  because I suspect the real reason behind the criticisms of the leader of the opposition is because the chief executive didn't invite him on one or two of these trips, because<endOfText>
<human>if if the stories of  are to be believed, and who would doubt him, is that the kind of person that  wants as an ambassador in Europe?<endOfText>
<bot>Nobody on this side of the Council Chamber wants a junket.<endOfText>
<human>Like Councillor , personally I've got better things to do, like being at home.<endOfText>
<bot>But I believe that the decisions made to go on the trips this autumn have been good ones.<endOfText>
<human>I would apologise unreservedly if I thought any of them have been a mistake but I don't believe they have been.<endOfText>
<bot>Any decision that has been made has been with the best intentions of the people of  at heart, to maintain  as a leading European city and to derive benefits for the people of this community.<endOfText>
<human>I'd just like to say a few words on the conferences that I attended.<endOfText>
<bot>The Euro Cities Conference in , and this is where the Tories fall down on the facts, because Councillor  doesn't really understand what Euro Cities is about.<endOfText>
<human>Euro Cities is a group of independent cities who're putting pressure on Brussels to maintain funding in urban areas after the review of the structural funds in 1993.<endOfText>
<bot>And, because of that pressure, the pressure that's already been put on, we got good news at .<endOfText>
<human>The European Commissions Director for regional policy said that he'd accepted the submission from Euro Cities that funding would be made available for urban areas.<endOfText>
<bot>We need to make sure that that pressure stays on because urban areas, as we know with the City Challenge bid and others, have got distinct and unique problems which we need to address.<endOfText>
<human>The Euro Cities Conference was also important because it was the founding of that organisation formally and it was important to go there and say to the big monopoly that's emerging it's<endOfText>
<bot><endOfText>
<human>One piece.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay let's see your essays   spend er twenty or thirty minutes talking about the essays and the remainder of the tutorial talking about er the exams because this is the last time I see you before your exams in the tutorial anyway erm so just a few hints and tips on exam technique.<endOfText>
<human>Right .<endOfText>
<bot>Right, by the way are your aware of erm Professor , erm which visited Nottingham at the moment .<endOfText>
<human>Tony  is er Professor of Economics at Cambridge and is a world renowned luminary in economic circles and er he's, he's here for the next week as a special professor and er is giving a number of lectures er most of which are open to, to all, to all students and he is a very famous economist, very clever chap you know if you can get to see him I, I'd reco I'd recommend it erm presuma there may be a sort of programme of his visit stuck up on the student notice boards erm, if there isn't er he's giving a, a lecture tomorrow  two o'clock in B seventy four and that's, that's if, he is going to be talking to the M A students er taking Economic Development and Policy Analysis and his topic there is comparing income inequality and poverty in Europe erm so if you, you know, if you are free tomorrow at two it just might be interesting to go along to,feel free to go to B seventy four tomorrow at two o'clock.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm there's another Econ Soc the Economic Society putting on a lecture at five o'clock on Wednesday er in A forty two and the topic there is What's Happening to the Distribution of Income in Britain and he is also talking to the Public Sector.<endOfText>
<human>Take Public Sector Economics and also taking a couple of lectures there, one on Targeting Social Security and er another lecture on An Inefficient on the Official Poverty Line, erm if you want er, well you can get the details from, from me afterwards but something like that could well be on the notice board if you want to go along and see him.<endOfText>
<bot>He is a famous chap Dick .<endOfText>
<human>If you've got time it might be worth spending an hour listening to him.<endOfText>
<bot>See what he s has to say.<endOfText>
<human>C can we see his ?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah sure.<endOfText>
<human>Thanks.<endOfText>
<bot>He's a Professor of Economics at Cambridge and er<endOfText>
<human>It's very big and  cos he's in the office next door.<endOfText>
<bot>Er er right  amazing.<endOfText>
<human>Anything else?<endOfText>
<bot>Did you get my  instruction junc adjustment?<endOfText>
<human>Yes that's  hello    this is just an article that we went through last  tutorial  adjustment developing countries.<endOfText>
<bot>Has everybody got one on this stage?<endOfText>
<human>That will just save you er copying that yourselves  library .<endOfText>
<bot>Right let's just briefly run through this er essay on migration that so some of you answered, can't remember, would somebody tell me the title of it again?<endOfText>
<human>It was er what are the major factors influencing migration decisions in less developed countries and how might this affect the urban unemployment.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay so  er where shall we start?<endOfText>
<human>Is migration, just generally, is migration a good or a bad, bad thing?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean well,why do people migrate?<endOfText>
<human>Getting married .<endOfText>
<bot>Okay they're migrating from an area of low incomes to an area of high incomes, right broken the route<endOfText>
<human>migration scenario.<endOfText>
<bot>Is that a good or a bad thing?<endOfText>
<human>Right okay depends whether they can get, they can get the jobs, right erm what was our experience say when er U K, France, Spain was developing?<endOfText>
<bot>There was a lot of rural urban migration then, was that a good thing or a bad thing?<endOfText>
<human>Does it help or hinder development of those countries?<endOfText>
<bot>Sorry?<endOfText>
<human>Helped.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah helped yeah, why was that?<endOfText>
<human>Well you answered it in the first, in the first answer that they got jobs they were employed er the, the rural labourers were able to, to get employment in urban areas er where wages were slightly above those wages that they could reasonably expect in agriculture and because they were actually productive making goods and services they helped the development process.<endOfText>
<bot>There, is the same true in countries that are developing at the moment?<endOfText>
<human>No what's happening there?<endOfText>
<bot>You get high levels of urban unemployment  there so migration to the urban areas and not finding employment  situation .<endOfText>
<human>That's right in, in a current case of  in developing countries now<endOfText>
<bot>migration is, is hampering the development process and that is quite different from when the now developed countries were de were developing fifty, hundred, hundred years ago.<endOfText>
<human>So how, how can we explain this  paradoxical situation of high unemployment in urban areas and rapid rates of er rural to urban migration?<endOfText>
<bot>Why is it happening, it seems paradoxical, I mean in theory erm, you know the migration should be driven by the wage, wage differentials, right and migration will redrit will reduce those, those wage differentials<endOfText>
<human>did a lot of the  emphasis on .<endOfText>
<bot>That's right that's, that's, that's the reason why, why they move .<endOfText>
<human>W why do, why do people move, I mean if they know there's urban unemployment, why, you know, why do they move?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean if you've got a paradoxical situation here and there is very high unemployment in the urban area, yet migration is still, is still an ongoing phenomenon,wh what may account for, they, they actually  again erm a well paid urban job and they migrate .<endOfText>
<human>Right so they may think that, you know, they're gonna be one of the lucky ones, presumably.<endOfText>
<bot>How about if I said well the reason why they migrate is that they don't know about urban unemployment, you know if, you know, it's a lack of information problem.<endOfText>
<human>If they knew that the unemployment rates were twenty or thirty percent in urban areas that they wouldn't migrate but because they don't have that information that's, that's the reason.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean does that hold any water, do you accept that?<endOfText>
<human>I mean it's a logical, it seems plausible anyway, erm empirical evidence, however, suggests that that isn't why we have rapid migration or such a large degree of migration.<endOfText>
<bot>Empirical evidence suggests that erm migrants are reasonably well informed about employment prospects in urban areas.<endOfText>
<human>Right, so why do they, why do they still move?<endOfText>
<bot>Well Tom suggested, well they could be one of the, one of the lucky ones that does get, does get a job, what other factors might account for<endOfText>
<human>Do they see erm, if, if they migrate to the city in the urban areas then they realize they won't get a job, and have a job straight away, er well paying job but by actually living in the area they would  and taking in  at a job and they get a lot of contacts and then eventually after a period of time they  job.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I mean that seems a plausible way of getting into the, er the job market, er what would Harrison Todaro erm say, you know, because they were saying that this migration, this migration was perfectly rational, despite there being high levels of unemployment.<endOfText>
<human>What was the basis of their argument?<endOfText>
<bot>Why did they say that migration occurs even when we have high unem unemployment?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, yeah okay over oh what century were they<endOfText>
<bot>long term  short term <endOfText>
<human>That's right, they say<endOfText>
<bot>they say even though unemployment rates are very high now, people are prepared to wait ten years before they get a job.<endOfText>
<human>Current levels of unemployment are relatively unimportant, hopefully some time down the line they will expect to get er as a relatively well paid job erm because agricultural incomes are so very low, you know, and urban incomes are relatively, relatively high, they may be prepared to wait for you know five or six years in the urban area, making what could be sort of a subsistence wage, simply because that's all that they're gonna be on anyway if they stay in the rural area, so if there is a higher probability of them getting a well paid job merely by being in the urban area making these contacts then they might as well move to the, to the urban area in the hope of some time in the future obtaining that er er an urban job.<endOfText>
<bot>Right okay.<endOfText>
<human>So what, I mean we've been t talking around it at the moment.<endOfText>
<bot>What are the factors that affect the migration decision?<endOfText>
<human>Does em does empirical evidence, well I think you probably say generally that there is some economic factors and there is some non economic factors, which of those two does er empirical evidence suggest is the main driving force behind migration?<endOfText>
<bot>Is it the lure of the bright lights or is it something more  economic.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah econ what appears to be the case is that it's economic reasons that are the main drive, the main driving factors from er the  migrant.<endOfText>
<bot>Although there, although there clearly are important non economic factors.<endOfText>
<human>The, the bright city lights that's not what makes people uproot their, uproot their lives and go and move somewhere else, they are after economic betterment and that's the driving force er behind migration so just before we leave the non economic factors what might they be?<endOfText>
<bot>The non econo economic factors this er erm infrastructure  services.<endOfText>
<human>okay right, anything else?<endOfText>
<bot>just wanting to get away from traditional .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, they may feel constrained in their very traditional modes of life  dominated by religion or some er some restrictive erm<endOfText>
<bot>norms of the, of the society.<endOfText>
<human>Anything else you can think of?<endOfText>
<bot>Weather .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, yeah that's right, due to s lack of infrastructure in the rural areas, it's much more lively but erm  the disaster of one form or another, of one form or, or another will have a much more important effect, well that's simply because there's a  flood then you either swim or you sink, you know, there's no, there's no help a at hand.<endOfText>
<bot>In urban area there may well be mechanisms in place five against, so on and so forth to, to sort out these problems.<endOfText>
<human>Okay right erm, so what seems to emerge is that it's economic factors that are the most important er determinants affecting the migrant's decision.<endOfText>
<bot>Right so migrants move to the urban areas erm due to the presence of higher wages there.<endOfText>
<human>What are the reason for my account the fact that there, they don't obtain these higher wages because clearly there is this income gap the differential is driving the whole process, yet economic theory tells us that the migration should, should diminish that gap between income in urban and rural areas<endOfText>
<bot>jobs to go around  the people who do migrate to the urban  skilled enough to  jobs.<endOfText>
<human>Okay our, our economic theory assumes  our economic theory assumes that both labour and capital are perfectly mobile.<endOfText>
<bot>are different sectors in urban areas.<endOfText>
<human>One that er they call the  that is the state  over employed people  and the  casual and  formal sector had wait  dates in the formal sector  they don't meet and if this sector does not create many many jobs .<endOfText>
<bot>Right okay so <endOfText>
<human>formal sector  wait<endOfText>
<bot>For, for opportunities<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>to, to emerge.<endOfText>
<human>That's right, all we've got here is that although there, there is a high degree of migration, the wage differentials are not er diminishing because we don't have perfectly mobile resources, like are theory tells us that we do have.<endOfText>
<bot>Clearly the labour is geographically mobile, it's not occupationally mobile, so the people that move don't necessarily have the skills required to take up these high wages.<endOfText>
<human>You obvious, supposed high wages in the urban area.<endOfText>
<bot>What other reasons might account for this urban rural wage differential, just generally higher er standard of living er just cost, just prices er  yeah, the cost the cost of living may well be higher and as a result employers have to pay  higher wages,<endOfText>
<human>Train staff slump, trained <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah could be important, who are the main employers?<endOfText>
<human>Who are, who's offering<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah that's one of the reasons for the, quite an important reason in, in many cases why, why there are ways of large wage differentials that's because there's a minimum wage legislation.<endOfText>
<human>Does that, does that <endOfText>
<bot>They don't assume it could be one of the factors that leads to the higher, I mean all these things, they don't actually say what cause the differential is to them.<endOfText>
<human>Say there is a differential, what affect does that have on mi on migration, that's where they sort of start from erm who were the import the employers, because er when it says, you know it says empirically validated, wages are higher er in, in the urban areas partly due to higher costs of living, partly due to the minimum wage legislation, but also another quite important influence.<endOfText>
<bot>There are some  ways of  government on wages.<endOfText>
<human>What do you mean there Martin?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean some, some  are better wages because they are subsidized by the government.<endOfText>
<human>Right<endOfText>
<bot>Which  welfare policy  by better wages.<endOfText>
<human>That's right, it's erm its empirically verified that in developing countries er the civil service or the, the government sector is very very large relative to the, to the economy, now whereas say U K or somewhere like France the government public and semi public er organizations employ ten percent of the, the workforce, perhaps a bit, bit more in France than the U K erm in developing countries the government sector can be, you know, over half of the total urban, urban employment, in some cases it's seventy and eighty percent of er employment.<endOfText>
<bot>Now it is generally observed that most civil servants whatever country they come from make sure that they er give each other pay rises and I know it happens in this country the Civil Service pay pays quite well and it's certainly a key erm feature in er pay structure in developing countries that if your, if you work for the government you are very very well paid, like government wages can be, you know, four, five, six, ten, twenty times<endOfText>
<human>of the, the national average and it's not because erm they're paying high wages to get the, the most able people, it's because there are mechanisms, institutional mechanisms that keep wages high, there's no market in the jobs for,th these are generalizations but I think they are fairly, fairly true erm becau there is no market for er for the jobs, for civil service jobs that appointments are made and it is much more important who you know than, than what, what you know and the old boy network, as it's called, in this country is fairly important in the English Civil Service but a similar sort of network tends to be far more important in developing countries, something that is euphemistically called patronage erm but we might call the old boy network or er er jobs for the boys whatever, but erm<endOfText>
<bot>Do they issue them, part of the reason that of them having higher wages is that part  industrials are bias  that they, they have a higher wages  and they think they will have a stronger growth in the industrial sector <endOfText>
<human>Well because there is er an industrial bias, erm  what industrial bias means is that  gets subsidized because it's subsidized they can pay higher wages er erm so it's not just the government jobs that are well paid it's the industrial jobs.<endOfText>
<bot>Now because the government has a, plays a much bigger role in the economy the government will be in charge of what you might think of as industrial employment so er a lot of manufacturing, heavy industry er mining so on and so forth will be run as a national as a national industry, right and er wages in that nationalized industry will not be er set at market levels but will be set at, by some institutional mechanism that won't reflect demand and supply or reflect the rent seeking and rent server rent preserving behaviour of civil servants and government quangos er so on and so forth but you must bear in mind that the government sector will er the public and semi public sector in developing countries is vast in comparison to er to develop the countries and as a result wages set in er in the government sector er will erm will be the driving force for all industrial employment, so what with wages and industrial employment.<endOfText>
<human>Okay erm<endOfText>
<bot>What's erm, what's a quango?<endOfText>
<human>Quango, government appointed body essentially.<endOfText>
<bot>Check I'm right, I think I can spell it, it's a Q isn't it quango?<endOfText>
<human>Yes<endOfText>
<bot>It's not so accurate.<endOfText>
<human>No I don't really think so, it's a name given to a body,so semi public body appointed by, by government.<endOfText>
<bot>Like the N R A?<endOfText>
<human>Sorry?<endOfText>
<bot>Like the N R A.<endOfText>
<human>Er are they privatized?<endOfText>
<bot>They  regulatory.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah that's a .<endOfText>
<bot>O P Q.<endOfText>
<human>How do you spell that?<endOfText>
<bot>I am just about to tell you  Q A P U quan quango, it's a  Q U A N G O  semi public body with financial support from and senior appointments made by government.<endOfText>
<human>Yes that's a semi  semi copy body appointed by the government or possibly with financial support from the government.<endOfText>
<bot>Right erm okay let's just er wrap up here.<endOfText>
<human>What was the main er outcome for Harrow Harrison Todaro's model?<endOfText>
<bot>They could explain why it was rational like for migrants to migrate even in the a even in the presence of high unemployment.<endOfText>
<human>What was the policy and complet <endOfText>
<bot>of that analysis?<endOfText>
<human>Basically government can increase or reduce unemployment by increasing labour demands through just handing out more jobs in the  sector.<endOfText>
<bot>That will create more migration.<endOfText>
<human>Right, so it will be sel self defeating, job creation in the urban areas will be self defeating and most of the, the reason why that was particularly important because historically most of the job creation schemes that governments have put in place with or without aid in developing countries is in the urban areas, you know, it's the erm subsidized industrial plants, subsidized erm manu manufacturing industry, right so that the import substitution industries er have been set up with government and or aid money, foreign aid money and what Harrison Todaro was saying you're wasting your time putting money into these big projects, right, because that only in that only in erm exaggerates th the migration problem because it really will increase people's perception of er job possibilities in the urban area, they think there are jobs being created by government there, that will happen as another, as another stimulus er let me just draw a little diagram what Harrison Todaro was saying right we've got time here such to say horizontal axis marks the lifespan of some representative migrant,then you've got wages, wages in the agricultural area and wages in the urban area like let's just say that this is the wage rate in agriculture, right .<endOfText>
<bot>Now, what the potential migrant will do, Harrison Todaro assumed, was to say, right what they'll do is that they'll, these migrants will mentally calculate the present value of receiving W A throughout their lifetime, right, and they'll discount erm those wages by appropriate discount rate, reflecting the fact that a hundred pounds today is worth a lot more than a hundred pounds twenty years' time or thirty years' time.<endOfText>
<human>Right so  something like that and so this represent I mean you can figure this line as being sort of the real wage over the time you mention increasing throughout.<endOfText>
<bot>Is the real wage over time so at this point let's just say that's a hundred, a hundred pounds and this is ten say two, well lifespan is thirty, thirty years and a hundred pounds erm today, today is worth er no<endOfText>
<human>Yes, it's worth two pounds in thirty years.<endOfText>
<bot>What you can buy with one hundred pounds today will buy just two pounds in thirty years?<endOfText>
<human>No that's erm, a hundred pounds in thirty years' time is equivalent to receiving two pounds today, that's right  as you say    .<endOfText>
<bot>Okay so if we just summoned this area  right, that area there represents the present value of the discounted stream of income.<endOfText>
<human>Right over, over a lifetime okay if we could sum this, it seems the time is continuous with the integrate, right, over  time, we'll just get the area of that and that curve.<endOfText>
<bot>Now let's say that urban wages, right are up here and that it's going to take, it's like this individual, this amount of time to get er a job at that, at that wage, let's say that's the expected wage, of the urban area, okay.<endOfText>
<human>If we again discount this income at the time or get  it looks like that.<endOfText>
<bot>So this now represents the discounted value of the urban wage overtime .<endOfText>
<human>All this potential migrant has to do is to say well does that area right exceed sorry this area.<endOfText>
<bot>chalk<endOfText>
<human>Okay does that area exceed that area, well that's clear from this little diagram, yes it does.<endOfText>
<bot>Well what are the key factors that will affect the relative sizes in these two, in these two erm, these two boxes.<endOfText>
<human>Well the first thing, right the differential  differential between agricultural wages and the expected erm urban wage right would create the closer these, these lines are together, right, the erm smaller would be the difference between this area here and that area there.<endOfText>
<bot>What other things are  are important?<endOfText>
<human>Well it's the time taken to gain employment  the time taken to gain employment  in the urban sector.<endOfText>
<bot>What is the expected urban wage?<endOfText>
<human>Well it's the, the actual urban wage times by the probability of getting a job, right, therefore,the probability of getting a job is also going,go going, is also going to be important erm erm  <endOfText>
<bot>this diagram doesn't actually incorporate this but  full thing is going to be the initial costs, the costs of moving, okay, so there, there may be actual physical costs involved  this diagram.<endOfText>
<human>Right so those are the things that are going to be  that will, that will be important.<endOfText>
<bot>Right erm, just finally,given that the main conclusion of Harrison Todaro's model was that there's no point erm having job creation schemes in urban areas because that just exacerbates the problem of migration.<endOfText>
<human>Right what should we do?<endOfText>
<bot>Migrat if migration is a problem I think you will all agree that it actually hampers the development process, what should we, what should we do?<endOfText>
<human>Create <endOfText>
<bot>Okay creating jobs in that sector or creating .<endOfText>
<human>Okay if that would raise agricultural wages or<endOfText>
<bot>Well raise agricultural wages  will reduce the number of people wanting to<endOfText>
<human>To migrate?<endOfText>
<bot>to migrate<endOfText>
<human>To migrate to the urban sector .<endOfText>
<bot>Okay and hows how best to do that though?<endOfText>
<human>Because it looks like you are advocating supporting agriculture.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay so what, what do rural developments schemes<endOfText>
<human>You will reduce the erm wage differentials as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Wi it may well do, it may well produce the<endOfText>
<human>wage differential <endOfText>
<bot>Increasing .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah okay I mean this is all what these schemes or what the current school of thought is.<endOfText>
<bot>Initially, you know, development meant higher than wages, alright, you know, making these erm er er sort of producing cars and high technology goods in urban, urban areas in developing countries was thought, you know, that's the way, that's the way ahead and these big projects, whereas now the thinking has changed and it's let's promote infrastructure, education, erm in the rural areas thems rural areas themselves, right, erm,anythi any other policies so yeah you may want to erm invest, invest in agriculture,and I don't mean some agricultural support but erm promote, well yeah make, make roads, educate the population erm disseminate agricultural technologies.<endOfText>
<human>Any other policies that you might think of?<endOfText>
<bot>Compulsory castration that's the main problem here, too many bloody people about,that's what's needed population control  well that's, that's what's done, that's what they er, you know a lot but not compulsory, well sometimes compulsory<endOfText>
<human>but we don't normally get money from the world bank to er er er get the scissors out, erm the note er<endOfText>
<bot>population control in terms of sort of contraception awareness, so on and so forth is a major,the it can be a major means of reducing this particular problem.<endOfText>
<human>Because part of the problem is that there are too many people in agriculture and if you can reduce the population threshold allowed, right, wages will virtually rise, because labour productivity will rise because there is less labour on the same amount of land.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, any other policies?<endOfText>
<human>some of these countries in Africa though they've got like compared with the population, they've got loads of land, compared with somewhere say like, like U K, so if that's the case, how come they've got so much surplus labour?<endOfText>
<bot>Well because the labour in say this country is over productive, this has an awful lot of categories attached to each unit of labour, that's why labour is very productive, is that you for each unit of labour employed there might be ten units of capital, I E there are chemicals  etcetera, the reason why erm this  this pressure on the land in say Africa, Africa, even though the density of population was much less and that there's virtually no capital there, right, so in order to produce the food, you know the labour has to till the soil by hand and spread the seed by hand<endOfText>
<human>Surely, that would require lots and lots of labour though wouldn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Mm, yes that's right<endOfText>
<human>So there should be a surplus?<endOfText>
<bot>Well it's just that for that, I mean that's all, it's all relative for those conditions there are, there is too much labour on the land, you erm, if you could increase agricultural productivity in a way that would displace labour and that's very difficult to do, well you can, you can do it er most, most capital is labour displacing but not all, not all capital, erm so you could, whereas I see, I see what you are saying is that, why  well  the you could g you could, you could do it right even though that there are a lot of people on the land er you could still make them wholly productive by giving them more capital that wasn't labour that wasn't labour displacing, like you give them better seeds for example, like that would increase the productivity of the land, there wouldn't be so much you know population pressure on the land er because everybody would have enough to eat and we could er actually sell something, right.<endOfText>
<human>Any other any other policies that you might want to pursue?<endOfText>
<bot>Say that's population control investment in agricultural infrastructure and technology  education and what's causing this problem in the first place?<endOfText>
<human>Do you have er sort of reduce the  industrial .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, that's what's causing the problem, very high urban wage rate but it doesn't reflect market forces, so if you erm reduce the subsidies given to er industry<endOfText>
<human>erm and get rid of any institutional price setting that there may or wage setting that there may be in those in those industries.<endOfText>
<bot>You know I hate to say it but privatization might be required, right there's too much government involvement, there's too much erm er there's too much inefficiency, right, by and large there's an awful lot of er bribery, corruption, patronage in developing countries, their government sectors are very very large.<endOfText>
<human>Okay just before we go  first we get a copy of er exam papers, this is from  G you may already have a copy  oh blast  <endOfText>
<bot>when you are talking about er public division, does  standards er  British and with other companies from er Western, Western economies?<endOfText>
<human>Okay so<endOfText>
<bot>There is, there is a gap in technology er now.<endOfText>
<human>That's right apart from <endOfText>
<bot>these government run industries in these developed countries, they are subsidized to a very large extent and they are not competitive on, on the world market.<endOfText>
<human>So  privatize this company there, there will er they will fail in competition with erm<endOfText>
<bot>They may, they may do.<endOfText>
<human>If that's the case you know resources shouldn't be going into, into that particular industry or there is not a direct economic case apart from to the social costs that they be involved in.<endOfText>
<bot>That company going out of business, erm because er large scale government subsidization erm is, is so prevalent in developing countries er the a lot of the government's resource's being spent on what are inefficient or obsolete industries.<endOfText>
<human>Mm mm.<endOfText>
<bot>And that's hampering the whole development process because it's  high, high wages, high wages creates migration and the whole resource allocation reflects in the economies er are disrupted and because people are moving out of agriculture because they can't make any money from agriculture they think they can make some money in industry like agriculture itself is being starved of capital and er so it hampers the development process, I mean it's a complicated business but er  there may well be some, some sort of strands of sense that we can draw out of this, one of which may be well if the government sectors are too large in these countries  essentially it doesn't matter who owns these companies whether it's, they were privately owned or government, erm if they are inefficient they are inefficient<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>and if that inefficiency was causing the problem it's not the result of the ownership er, there are inefficient private companies it's just that inefficient private companies tend to go out of business, whereas inefficient public ones can be maintained with subsidization.<endOfText>
<human>. What I'll do is that I'll  final  of action shortly and I'll tu <endOfText>
<bot>that's my last copy, that's what I'll do, I'll photocopy it before you go and er give you a copy each <endOfText>
<human>don't worry I  the exam, I'm leaving at Christmas time.<endOfText>
<bot>Alright, oh I see you are not sitting, you are not taking the exams?<endOfText>
<human>last year's exam, they er seems to be exactly the same syllabus  more or less, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Can I just say, just a couple of points before you go erm  you are all fairly good at writing long answer essay questions, but you are probably not so good at writing short answer questions, right.<endOfText>
<human>Now it is very important that you write good short answer questions, because you think they're <endOfText>
<bot>in actual fact that's where most people fall down and last year <endOfText>
<human>Is it marked with a fifty?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, fifty  given it exactly the same way.<endOfText>
<human>It's much easier to get good marks on a short answer question than it is in theory to  but most people don't because they don't apply the correct technique so to writing short answers.<endOfText>
<bot>We must have in a  short answer like there's a definition, most of the concepts there will be erm defined effective protection, its optimal, optimal tariff, trained creation, or trained diversion, there will be concepts that need definition, economic jargon, so you must have an equal er definition in there and you must have examples of how this concept is used, right say erm  er one of those  about don't make reciprocal dumping.<endOfText>
<human>Write a short essay on reciprocal dumping because define what reciprocal dumping is you've also got to give at least one example of reciprocal dumping, right, so you don't have to give any detailed examples just erm E E C waste er food policy  in these days reciprocal dumping would be subsidized after  exports in order for America to sell its few exports it has to  so it is best subsidised  definition define what it is give application of  concept erm if the concept involves measurement, say how it, how it can be measured say an effective protection  trade, er say how it could, how it could be measured<endOfText>
<bot>er and then discuss any problems that there might be, is it a contentious issue?<endOfText>
<human>Er or are there is there, are there a couple of schools of thought on this particular subject, well essentially what you must do is write something about everything you know, about erm that this particular sort of concept, don't write everything you know on this particular subject, like you have only got fifteen minutes.<endOfText>
<bot>So it's, is it better to write a little bit about a lot of things?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Rather than a lot about<endOfText>
<human>That's what you must do, if you get, if you write a lot about a couple of things they'll say erm this chap's knowledge is pretty specialized on this area, you know what, what these er short answer questions are picking up right is your, is your general knowledge.<endOfText>
<bot>So it has to be sort of like written in comprehensive?<endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>written prose<endOfText>
<human>But you know, so you<endOfText>
<bot>it's like writing an essay, you've got to try and get as mi many things in as you would do when you if you were writing a full essay but instead of writing a paragraph on each thing you write a sentence on each thing  try and cover as many bases, then, that's how you how you get very good marks, it's not, they are not trying to test your erm your deep knowledge about any one thing in these short answers they are testing the broad, broad venture of your, of your knowledge, alright, so what you want to try and do is to  is a blunderbuss approach when you ans you answer these, these questions.<endOfText>
<human>Yes,this these diagrams.<endOfText>
<bot>Don't touch it with a barge pole, they take too much time but very very rarely do you need to write, to draw the diagram in the short answer questions.<endOfText>
<human>That's about the only difference between writing a short answer question than writing a long answer question, is that the long answer is a, is a good idea to have a diagram.<endOfText>
<bot>In short answers unless it is crying out for a diagram don't bother because you'll spend five minutes drawing the diagram, labelling it, explaining what D P and D S means and  it just won't work it  definition, application, measurement problems, contention,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>is it a contentious issue erm ho how is the  criticized, very very short, because you are only going to be writing for about a page, a page and a half, right, so just make sure that every sentence or every other sentence carries a new bit of information and then people say, good, this person knows everything about this subject, full marks and you and er but it's all too easy to, to focus on one or two aspects of say a question on  trade or er er Harrison Todaro model of migration.<endOfText>
<human>If you sp if you spend five minutes drawing a diagram or going through the equations  person knows one aspect of this model in great detail, what they want to know is what was the importance of that, of that model, important results of the model.<endOfText>
<bot>How can we criticize it, how well does it actually fit into what happened in the real world, they just want little bits of information but not too much depth on anything but always remember empirical evidence examples are very important  what I would do is using those examples or la last year's exam paper, practise, practise the short answers because you can't write very much detail in it so it's a good idea to have some idea about how much you can write, then your expectations will be changed okay.<endOfText>
<human>Right if you have problems er before you leave or when you're advising afterwards I'll be here throughout vacation and before your exams so come along and you go through <endOfText>
<bot>holiday are you?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Full time.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, if you want to come and see me please, please do.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, alright.<endOfText>
<human>Cheerio.<endOfText>
<bot>next Monday I want to see you  have a happy Christmas.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you very much Gabriella, happy Christmas to you.<endOfText>
<bot>See you, see you next term.<endOfText>
<human>Okay<endOfText>
<bot>If you do have, if you do have any problems<endOfText>
<human>Mm mm.<endOfText>
<bot>er come along and see me because I, because it is quite you know likely that you will sort of worry about<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>the exams and if I can sort of say, you don't need to worry about<endOfText>
<human>Mm mm.<endOfText>
<bot>about this you are wasting your time, er then hopefully you  if you are having a problem  to come and see me and I can tell you if it is a problem or whether it's not, it's not particularly a problem, so you know, come along and see me <endOfText>
<human>Thank you very much.<endOfText>
<bot>Right but have a lovely holiday, don't forget to have, don't forget to have a holiday, don't revise all the way through.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, cheerio Gabriella.<endOfText>
<human><endOfText>
<bot>It's only dollars it takes and got to pay her two hundred dollars.<endOfText>
<human>That's two .<endOfText>
<bot>Two pence.<endOfText>
<human>How much?<endOfText>
<bot>Err, let's give him one pound, no, thirty pound.<endOfText>
<human>Search .<endOfText>
<bot>It will take a long time.<endOfText>
<human>.<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>I'll put some .<endOfText>
<bot>Yes me lady, no me lady, three bags full me lady.<endOfText>

<human>And he co , and how much did he cost me, Charles?<endOfText>
<bot>Forty five pounds for that foot last year!<endOfText>
<human>Well I think you should put him out to work!<endOfText>
<bot>Get some cash in!<endOfText>
<human>Well  that's pretty incidental in the morning.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Cos he's bound, I mean with all that mud and everything, I mean there's lots of  sheep droppings and god knows what up there isn't there?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah I know, it needs treatment though darling.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I know it still needs treatment but I mean it'll  try and get the swelling down a bit.<endOfText>

<bot>And he's running the stocks suddenly.<endOfText>
<human>I mean I'm sure it's the same claw cos it's never grown back  you see, when he's had it cut off but  what the vet was hoping was that the claw would grow back and the the top of  of the tissue, see what I mean?<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>And what's happened is the tissue has grown and not the bloody nail!<endOfText>
<bot>Oh I see.<endOfText>
<human>And and what <endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>it has done has just become distorted and it's splitting more away from the nail.<endOfText>

<human>They're saying that on, just now I was listening <endOfText>
<bot>on Radio Three<endOfText>
<human>But I don't !<endOfText>
<bot>and they were saying about people with er, F M problems and they got a big coat hanger <endOfText>
<human>Where is this big problem ?<endOfText>
<bot>in the back of  <endOfText>
<human>Well it's <endOfText>
<bot>and they can't get a reception <endOfText>
<human>and <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>anyway they was talking about getting a proper aerial, it's all basic stuff <endOfText>
<bot>I mean you wouldn't wanna go anywhere where there was confidential things.<endOfText>
<human>and they were talking about a new system which I couldn't hear because of vacuum cleaner was on<endOfText>
<bot>Was it?<endOfText>
<human>Was it?<endOfText>
<bot>erm  which doesn't suffer from  er  multi-path  reception<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>so i , car radios and things like that the reception will be constant wherever you are because you don't get any noise.<endOfText>
<human>They won't listen to it?<endOfText>
<bot>It'll just be analyzed in the computer.<endOfText>
<human>I'm trying, trying to say they need some people to listen to that and  you know, to get the new words if that is the case.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, well what you do is they give you a sheet of paper  and th , you write down who was involved in the conversation, so all I'd say is, is erm  Mum <endOfText>
<human>Oh you <endOfText>
<bot>Dad, or John, Elly  or  or something like that.<endOfText>
<human>I th I mean they're not interested in  actual names, so if there's two Johns they put John one and John two.<endOfText>
<bot>That's the sort of idea.<endOfText>
<human>So that if <endOfText>
<bot>Well <endOfText>
<human>if they listen on another tape  all the <endOfText>
<bot>What happens , what happens now that you know that somebody has said something very confidential, you know, a personal matter?<endOfText>
<human>Well I just we , rewind it and then  tape over <endOfText>
<bot>You can <endOfText>
<human>it.<endOfText>
<bot>oh, cause a <endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>complex.<endOfText>
<human>And how long can, does this tape last?<endOfText>
<bot>Like if I, if if you know  if you say, oh I object to this, then I'd just turn it off and rer rer erase it.<endOfText>
<human>Oh right.<endOfText>
<bot>Well what <endOfText>
<human>Oh I see.<endOfText>
<bot>i it's probably to do with new words like wa wally and things <endOfText>
<human>I was quite funny yesterday <endOfText>
<bot>like that.<endOfText>
<human>cos I had it running in the kitchen while we were cooking tea last night  and Sue came in and goes     a real big fart , and goes oh I haven't been able to fart all week,she says !<endOfText>
<bot>And she didn't know !<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But er  according to Sharon she's been sitting alone in er  bed and breakfast and erm<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, it's a nice bed and breakfast.<endOfText>
<bot>She's got her own  ensuite and  er<endOfText>
<human>I know, but then she has nobody to chat to <endOfText>
<bot>chap brings her a cup of tea at nine o'clock.<endOfText>
<human>at night cos there's nobody here to have a conversation with.<endOfText>
<bot>No, I think she was  getting chatted up by the bloke who owned the place, really!<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah?<endOfText>
<human>Some chap runs it with his wife.<endOfText>
<bot>I see.<endOfText>
<human>So what time is Sue er  coming?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I'll pick her up<endOfText>
<human>Well  won't be home will she?<endOfText>
<bot>about quarter to and I'm coming back here.<endOfText>
<human>she's having her hair done.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, get her to wait to do that.<endOfText>
<human>Oh God, I've still got the dogs in the car, hang on!<endOfText>
<bot>Oh!<endOfText>
<human>Do you want a hand?<endOfText>
<bot>Can I just dump them , dump them in the shed quickly?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I've hoovered up you can't bring them in here!<endOfText>
<human>I won't bring them in here, put them in round back.<endOfText>
<bot>Can you get one?<endOfText>
<human>The the door's not open.<endOfText>
<bot>Haven't got any shoes on.<endOfText>
<human>I'll be back in a minute.<endOfText>
<bot>Show him where the key is.<endOfText>
<human>She said she was from the <endOfText>
<bot>Well it's sort of like market research type  type idea.<endOfText>
<human>Oh!boy, you might like it.<endOfText>
<bot>So do you get to keep the Walkman?<endOfText>
<human>Cor!<endOfText>
<bot>If only!<endOfText>
<human>And how long do you have?<endOfText>
<bot>Just a week.<endOfText>
<human>That all?<endOfText>
<bot>Do you wear it every day?<endOfText>
<human>All day?<endOfText>
<bot>Well  I dunno whether I'll be able to use at work you see, I'll have to ask the  the governor.<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes!<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>He might not like that at all!<endOfText>
<bot>I'll reckon they'll say no.<endOfText>
<human>They probably will but<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>if they do well there's  not a lot we can do about it really.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you sure this works  at the moment.<endOfText>
<human>, big word.<endOfText>
<bot>We want to  <endOfText>
<human>Course it's working!<endOfText>
<bot>from , that's what it's really is.<endOfText>
<human>The sound comes over !<endOfText>
<bot>No!<endOfText>
<human>What did the ?<endOfText>
<bot>The sound comes over on what?<endOfText>
<human>On the machine, you mean?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, and then hold it up, do you know what I mean?<endOfText>
<human>Do want to sit me far away from you, will that still take it?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah!<endOfText>
<human>Will it?<endOfText>
<bot>Well it's got automatic level control on it.<endOfText>
<human>On the recording.<endOfText>
<bot>It's one of those little mikes they have on television.<endOfText>
<human>Automatic?<endOfText>
<bot>Honestly!<endOfText>
<human>Well it just looks at the the signal level coming in and adjusts the gain accordingly.<endOfText>
<bot>When I shouted in it I thought you were joking.<endOfText>
<human>Oh no, that'll just shut down the gain  and this <endOfText>
<bot>Will it really?<endOfText>
<human>probably still come out clear, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Mark.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, ah well  the thing to do is to er  go down and hi , hire a Daily Mirror van and  wait for Mrs  to arrive!<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Well I don't like it very much I must say!<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, there's your privacy gone!<endOfText>
<human>You know?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah but it's completely anonymous, and no one 's gonna know I'm talking to you are they?<endOfText>
<human>No, I'm trying to say  what is behind all this  if you really think of it?<endOfText>
<bot>Well it's beg it's  to get the words  in everyday conversation <endOfText>
<human>Well,<endOfText>
<bot>isn't it!<endOfText>
<human>I don't believe it's true, that's<endOfText>
<bot>Ha!<endOfText>
<human>Well, I don't believe, they are after sound and the difference, you know, I mean you sit like this can you still hear me?<endOfText>
<bot>Or if you are in the kitchen, mum!<endOfText>
<human>Well they're not gonna know!<endOfText>
<bot>Can you still hear that?<endOfText>
<human>They're not  they're not, that's already been done hasn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>They've already, this is a commercial machine this thing, you buy them down at Dixon's.<endOfText>
<human>New words!<endOfText>
<bot>My God surely they don't need ordinary people to have new words, they just  look around in universities!<endOfText>
<human>That's where they go through for new words!<endOfText>
<bot>on colloquial<endOfText>
<human>No!<endOfText>
<bot>erm<endOfText>
<human>I reckon it's advertising, that's what it is  to see whether people are mentioning certain products.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, have you been using Daz Automatic recently!<endOfText>
<human>Oh, dear oh dear !<endOfText>
<bot>No, I use !<endOfText>
<human>Well  I'm thinking of conversations, you know?<endOfText>
<bot>That er  isn't anything to do with people spying for instance?<endOfText>
<human>Oh nobody's gonna talk about that with this are they!<endOfText>
<bot>No, no, say , I'm talking, that is seeing the advantage of it you see.<endOfText>
<human>Say, for instance erm  somebody wants to hear your opinion about and and get a, plans to  er  you know, to to , you you find that out for me, you know that's what I'm saying!<endOfText>
<bot>Well they wouldn't be carrying a bloody great mike like that <endOfText>
<human>Well <endOfText>
<bot>round would you!<endOfText>
<human>you could hide away it.<endOfText>
<bot>You can't, cos if it goes inside your jumper it ge , the sound all gets muffled.<endOfText>
<human>They have to be on the outside right, cos as soon as it goes through a piece of material you'll lose all the high frequency to it.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I don't like the idea of it very much !<endOfText>
<human>Don't you ?<endOfText>
<bot>Well , wearing them out, things like that.<endOfText>
<human>The thing to do is is to sort of er  plot to overthrow parliament or something and see if there's any reaction!<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I couldn't wait to test it !<endOfText>
<bot>Or tell them , tell them there's a few million pounds worth of gold coins in some field!<endOfText>
<human>This bloody great hole the next day there !<endOfText>
<bot>Bring all the  and shovels and  !<endOfText>
<human>Do it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I had to laugh though cos I was talking  chap at work and  they'd sent round this erm  this form  right, to fill in about your opinion about the company and everything.<endOfText>
<human>And said, so it's completely anonymous and all that  and he said oh I can't be bothered to send that in, so he chucked it in the bin   and they phoned him up and said why haven't you sent your form in ?<endOfText>
<bot>That's completely anonymous?<endOfText>
<human>I thought, I thought you were going to say we found his form on  tip!<endOfText>
<bot>Something to do with the rubbish, that is.<endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Rupert Maxwell had everything taped didn't he?<endOfText>
<human>All the offices .<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes.<endOfText>
<human>But who has he got employed to check it?<endOfText>
<bot>Well he hadn't got anybody that he would trust there you see<endOfText>
<human>No, but I mean the whole day, I <endOfText>
<bot>not even the people he paid <endOfText>
<human>talked  with a few people<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>an and then erm  you know, who's going to listen to that tonight, you know, to see what they've <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>been saying?<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>You've got to have someone for that as well, you know!<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, and then an can he then  can you trust the staff?<endOfText>
<bot>No, I'll get you sheet of paper on erm  what it's about.<endOfText>
<human>Oh I didn't bring it with me, I've only got my record book.<endOfText>
<bot>But the idea is <endOfText>
<human>to see you.<endOfText>
<bot>you fill out a little sheet of paper  with the, with the names like John A, John B or whatever, so that if there's another tape and you've marked John B and they missed a word, or what  what the word was and they  there's a chance that they might use it again later on you see.<endOfText>
<human>Probably want some erm  articulate people .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Put down, the Buckingham Palace!<endOfText>
<bot>Ah, are they articulate?<endOfText>
<human>well they obviously use the Oxford Dictionary, not Longmans so<endOfText>
<bot>Ha!<endOfText>
<human>You've heard of Longmans haven't you?<endOfText>
<bot>The printers?<endOfText>
<human>Longmans, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Publishers.<endOfText>
<human>It's the Longman's er, Dictionary.<endOfText>
<bot>There's more to it than meets the eye!<endOfText>
<human>Oh mum, mum's always <endOfText>
<bot>So do they <endOfText>
<human>had a suspicious mind hasn't she?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>do they, do they erm  I mean, how do they analyze it?<endOfText>
<bot>Well<endOfText>
<human>Do they listen  and le all the words that they recognize, they leave?<endOfText>
<bot>Those matches are .<endOfText>
<human>But the ones that  they're not familiar with they lo look up do they?<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know, maybe they erm  a , they'll listen to the tapes  and they probably sample some of the words into a computer  to build up a database    of words that probably  like you said, oh he's getting a lot of jip from his boss, you know, is probably not in the dictionary  but if a lot of people said that word then they would.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, that's I meant.<endOfText>
<bot>Have to has to come into common use before it gets into the dictionary.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So if it was  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, that's right.<endOfText>
<bot>from actual people<endOfText>
<human>That's why it's best not to tell people that you're doing it you see because then they  they're careful what they say.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>You know.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, they might  but it'll be a classic <endOfText>
<human>You can't help doing it though can you?<endOfText>
<bot>If you'd have made a story up that's it something else, I wo I wouldn't have known it's running.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>If you weren't have said ooh I  was listening on the phones and just a  leave it on, you know  the phones.<endOfText>
<bot>What always amazes me when we play scrabble  I mean, things that I consider to be slang  you know, on the odd time I thought well I'll try that <endOfText>
<human>Well it used to be slang.<endOfText>
<bot>and I put them in, and I look in my dictionary, they're not there of course, cos my  dictionary I had is from nineteen forty six<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>look in even  er  ten years later it's there.<endOfText>
<human>And tremendous number of of words which were  written in slang, they were almost obscenities er <endOfText>
<bot>Well that's <endOfText>
<human>in there, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>that's why you need to change your dictionary every few <endOfText>
<human>That's right.<endOfText>
<bot>years.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, to keep up.<endOfText>
<bot>Ooh!<endOfText>
<human>Your mother's kicking <endOfText>
<bot>Ooh my ear!<endOfText>
<human>you now!<endOfText>
<bot>Did you get that?<endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah, we've seen it all now!<endOfText>
<bot>Oh dear!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Well I'll, I'm going up to the vet so I'll leave it running when we're in the vet.<endOfText>
<human>Cos it's all different <endOfText>
<bot>Have you switched it off now?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, what's that then?<endOfText>
<human>They're the headphones.<endOfText>
<bot>So you can  play back and listen, make sure it's come out alright.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>She certainly has the right bloke to do it.<endOfText>
<human>Nobody else would have the patience!<endOfText>
<bot>You should have a hundred and fifty pound for it, not twenty five!<endOfText>
<human>Well  it's no big deal really is it?<endOfText>
<bot>Just a case of  taking the tape deck around  and if you're not having a conversation yo you can use the radio so  I'm not really worried.<endOfText>
<human>Oh can you?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah!<endOfText>
<bot>Oh!<endOfText>
<human>And they supply the batteries?<endOfText>
<bot>Yep.<endOfText>
<human>And twenty tapes  which you erm  you don't have to use all them  just  you know, fill what you can<endOfText>
<bot>Can you keep the ones that you don't use?<endOfText>
<human>No, you just give them back.<endOfText>
<bot>I used one of your tapes you brought me for Christmas yesterday,very nice!<endOfText>
<human>Good quality one?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah,<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>in my old tatty machine!<endOfText>
<human>Ooh, I've got some questions!<endOfText>
<bot>Ooh !<endOfText>
<human>Go on then?<endOfText>
<bot>One will just be a quick, quickie.<endOfText>
<human>Erm  Pete is <endOfText>
<bot>Are they confidential?<endOfText>
<human>Go on then.<endOfText>
<bot>Pete's interested in  obtaining a  tarmac, is it?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, no, that's all I know.<endOfText>
<bot>A tarmac?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, it's four track recording.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh T-ach <endOfText>
<human>Oh T-ach <endOfText>
<bot>Tarmac !<endOfText>
<human>I knew it was something like that.<endOfText>
<bot>Tarmac you get out of a  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I wouldn't know.<endOfText>
<human>Handy thing to have if you if your road .<endOfText>
<bot>Erm <endOfText>
<human>You wo won't be able to record a lot of music on it though.<endOfText>
<bot>Go on <endOfText>
<human>A four <endOfText>
<bot>then.<endOfText>
<human>a four track erm<endOfText>
<bot>Multi-track.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And I told him that you had all the gear and I said that you wanted sixteen.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Thirty two.<endOfText>
<bot>No, I was sixteen down the studio wasn't I?<endOfText>
<human>What have yo , what have you got now then?<endOfText>
<bot>I got four track.<endOfText>
<human>Four track.<endOfText>
<bot>Four track on half inch.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, half of the tape.<endOfText>
<bot>Was it a cassette base or erm  a reel to reel?<endOfText>
<human>No, I said he wants to buy one.<endOfText>
<bot>I think he wants to buy one.<endOfText>
<human>Pete, who's Pete?<endOfText>
<bot>My ex-boyfriend who's been helping .<endOfText>
<human>Pete the strange, the strange, well   <endOfText>
<bot>I don't remem <endOfText>
<human>boy.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't remember Pete.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, you do, Peter!<endOfText>
<bot>Peter?<endOfText>
<human>Oh right!<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, yeah!<endOfText>
<human>After Jonathan.<endOfText>
<bot>The one who was in erm  good lord!<endOfText>
<human>I can't keep track!<endOfText>
<bot>What the one who's er  off round the world and  oil rigs or something.<endOfText>
<human>yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Is he going back?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah!<endOfText>
<human>I gotta take him some letters.<endOfText>
<bot>Have you?<endOfText>
<human>Well he's been helping me with things.<endOfText>
<bot>Is he a musician then?<endOfText>
<human>Well he plays quite a bit of guitar.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah?<endOfText>
<human>And he wants to know where he can buy them in Ipswich.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh oh!<endOfText>
<human>And that's why he's not at home.<endOfText>
<bot>So<endOfText>
<human>There's quite a lot of second hand if he's willing to travel around for them.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Depends what he wants.<endOfText>
<bot>But I mean er  you can get cassette based ones which are quite cheap  and cheap to run  cos you just use, you know, good quality  metal tapes  and you get four tracks  I think they even make a six track one now, or an eight track.<endOfText>
<human>He only wants four.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  <endOfText>
<human>Er  Norwich Road.<endOfText>

<human>Yeah, I know, well I'll book two weeks in advance.<endOfText>
<bot>busy.<endOfText>

<bot>Oh  oh well done anyway.<endOfText>
<human>Oh well we can go for a cup of tea now, I need some breakfast I'm starving!<endOfText>
<bot>Mum's making a cup of tea and  a nice piece of chocolate cake.<endOfText>
<human>Oh brilliant!<endOfText>
<bot>I need more than that I'm starving!<endOfText>
<human>Anyway, give us a kiss.<endOfText>
<bot>Your cheeks are cold again.<endOfText>
<human>I had about two inches cut off actually.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, it's a lot better than <endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah!<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah, it's got a little fringe on there!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, well it's a lot better length, you know, it was too long and it's  much nicer this length, much more manageable I found.<endOfText>
<bot>It desperately needed a cut though, it was really irritating me!<endOfText>
<human>Bloody building's a real eyesore isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Jesus!<endOfText>
<human>Disgusting!<endOfText>
<bot>It really irritates me!<endOfText>
<human>I can just imagine what it's gonna look like in a few years when it gets <endOfText>
<bot>So can I.<endOfText>
<human>dirty, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>Rough!<endOfText>
<human>Ugh!<endOfText>
<bot>Don't!<endOfText>
<human>Never mind   won't change when I put it up, so, that's all I care about really.<endOfText>
<bot>Well it's not all I care about but <endOfText>
<human>You said that so so damned !<endOfText>
<bot>No one 's gonna build anything.<endOfText>
<human>I know.<endOfText>
<bot>Good!<endOfText>
<human>Oh, I know what Pam didn't bring, she was saying ooh you know  apparently they've  shut up all the entrances, the gaps in the fences cos they want to encourage  erm  wildlife to be on the back, on the mere an and not dogs and that!<endOfText>
<bot>So she said, you know, they were   <endOfText>
<human>They fenced what?<endOfText>
<bot>They, you know, at the back of us they've  blocked up the fences but I don't know whether she's got it right, I don't know.<endOfText>
<human>I said well Scott, you know, said that if  you know, we ever take our dogs on there  he erm  would give us a ring  and he hasn't.<endOfText>
<bot>Or we would know, you know.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So I hope they're not gonna say we don't want you on there cos of wildlife stuff.<endOfText>
<human>Oh shit!<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but he doesn't own the bit behind us does he?<endOfText>
<human>Course he does!<endOfText>
<bot>Ah, no I mean the  I thought you meant the bit beyond the field.<endOfText>
<human>There's not really wildlife in  it's just a back grass area!<endOfText>
<bot>Well I know.<endOfText>
<human>So what what <endOfText>
<bot>Unless it's long, you won't get anything in there.<endOfText>
<human>what Bonnie was saying was erm  don't you mean the common area bit, you know, the bit at the back?<endOfText>
<bot>She didn't seem to know, I thought well I'm not really <endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>worried about it I'm sure!<endOfText>
<human>And if he is doing that I don't think he'll mind us going on there cos the other dogs that have started walking on there, do you know what I mean?<endOfText>
<bot>Can't really stop that <endOfText>
<human>Well I haven't <endOfText>
<bot>much.<endOfText>
<human>Well I haven't many  really.<endOfText>
<bot>But if you walk through there I bet you haven't boarded those .<endOfText>
<human>I mean <endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Sally was talking about it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, well she should of, she should <endOfText>
<human>she's a bit <endOfText>
<bot>have had that.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah I know.<endOfText>
<bot>And she ooh you know I've spoken to Scott and asked him.<endOfText>
<human>And I thought yeah I know mate, you might of now but you bloody well hadn't a year ago well I said well  so I said before we even put the on the field once we'd phoned him up asked.<endOfText>
<bot>Alright, alright she said.<endOfText>
<human>And I bloody well know that when we  you know, first moved there and we're in the caravan she hadn't asked him and they'd already been there eighteen months!<endOfText>
<bot>Felt guilty as hell the first time I went on there!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but you did have permission.<endOfText>
<bot>Well that's me all over isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah but we had permission.<endOfText>
<bot>Not for the first time.<endOfText>
<human>We did!<endOfText>
<bot>No, it was the day we went to get Bunny I think wasn't it?<endOfText>
<human>The day you went to get Bunny and I had terrible hay fever.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah, on the common land.<endOfText>
<human>That common land doesn't belong to Scott though.<endOfText>
<bot>That belongs to that other git!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Er<endOfText>
<human>Before we went on Scott's land we had permission.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, come on then!<endOfText>
<human>Ding dong!<endOfText>
<bot>What's this for?<endOfText>
<human>Oh it's quite good, to stop people tripping over.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos <endOfText>

<bot>they're not necessarily   <endOfText>
<human>You wouldn't mind the royalties for that anyway!<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>Look at that it fits it perfectly!<endOfText>
<bot>And we have a lot of experience.<endOfText>
<human>The other co , other things come and go but <endOfText>
<bot>It's now up to them.<endOfText>
<human>Scrabble goes on forever.<endOfText>
<bot>You know, it's like Heinz beans!<endOfText>
<human>And erm <endOfText>
<bot>And it, I went to Birmin , Birmingham Children's Hospital  <endOfText>
<human>I eat, oh where you going?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh  !<endOfText>
<human>and it was very  to actually go to a children's <endOfText>
<bot>Two.<endOfText>
<human>ward<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>and actually see   <endOfText>
<bot>Shit!<endOfText>
<human>and the way you got   but er  they  you know.<endOfText>
<bot>You know, it's alright in our manager levels but if you go higher than that then I mean they're just useless!<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>Waste of space really compared with a , paediatrics cos they er  hey haven't got the forethought or the .<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>You know what I mean?<endOfText>
<human>Whereas you  I mean it's great you go into Birmingham Children's Hospital and it's red and blue and green and balloons and it was great!<endOfText>
<bot>And, and we've just had our walls repainted and I furious with  with erm  Rita  cos all she we , all she got was these bloody pastel colours  I tell you if I was  <endOfText>
<human>Ah for kids?<endOfText>
<bot>out for blood!<endOfText>
<human>The place is , red and blue and greens.<endOfText>
<bot>They're they're alright for mature adults aren't they?<endOfText>
<human>Eh?<endOfText>
<bot>They're alright for mature adults but pastel shades are too <endOfText>
<human>They're boring!<endOfText>
<bot>boring for children aren't they?<endOfText>
<human>You know I mean <endOfText>
<bot>kids like a bit of colour and <endOfText>
<human>that's right!<endOfText>
<bot>and Mickey mice  and mouses or <endOfText>
<human>That's it!<endOfText>
<bot>whatever you call it?<endOfText>
<human>I mean we've got all that, you know <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>but we're not allowed to put posters on the walls you know, it's better for them to stick them at <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>or something.<endOfText>
<bot>Why not?<endOfText>
<human>Are they worried about  destroying the <endOfText>
<bot>Well no well <endOfText>
<human>paint?<endOfText>
<bot>Well use <endOfText>
<human>Well <endOfText>
<bot>Blu-tac or something can't you?<endOfText>
<human>That's right!<endOfText>
<bot>Well no you'd be amazed what they do, if you leave Blu Blu- tac up for a while how  it actually takes <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, marks or <endOfText>
<bot>the paint as well <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>And erm  their consultant he really annoys me he erm<endOfText>
<bot>The silly part about it though <endOfText>
<human>he's one of these <endOfText>
<bot>they should have panels Sue, in a children's ward!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, that's right.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but we do <endOfText>
<human>You know <endOfText>
<bot>have panels John but then <endOfText>
<human>long, long plain pieces of area you could <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>easily, you have to put roller over, you know, a quick <endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>job and use that for poster area and not touch the rest.<endOfText>
<bot>But you'd be amazed actually the few small bits  areas there are, cos they put the, well the nice thing is it's a light building and there's loads of windows everywhere<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>and there aren't big stretches of wall.<endOfText>
<human>I mean <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I said to Cathy, look, why don't we get the polytechnic to erm, do a mirage?<endOfText>
<bot>I think she thought I was mad!<endOfText>
<human>And I said, look, get them to do a section of mirage and then it up on the ceiling<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>all the way across.<endOfText>
<bot>Well can't they paint it straight on in the mi , on the ceiling?<endOfText>

<human>and she erm  they got these <endOfText>
<bot>What is it?<endOfText>
<human>people in to paint all the corridors, this place was really dowdy wasn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>All<endOfText>
<bot>I mean our place is nothing like that, I mean it isn't dowdy but  they can probably put up wall coverings, scrap piece of paper, and they were  drawings that the kids had ju , had drawn for us you know, and we said, look here mate, get stuffed, you know!<endOfText>
<human>Well the thing is Sue that so many people  don't have any feeling for chi for children like that <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>do they?<endOfText>
<bot>That they do their work and th and and <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>they're conscientious and everything but the a child's painting is seen ju a bit of scrap paper!<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>But I mean that's a child's expression and that's <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>their work an an <endOfText>
<human>That's right!<endOfText>
<bot>you know if you were pre , you can communicate with the children through that piece of paper <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>but if you <endOfText>

<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>they've got a children's hospital there  and I'm doing a paediatric health course for a month.<endOfText>
<human>Oh right.<endOfText>
<bot>So children with leukaemia and  <endOfText>
<human>All  <endOfText>
<bot>yeah?<endOfText>
<human>Mm mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Whatever!<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>It's all good stuff!<endOfText>
<human>Can't be a lot of fun though can it?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  well i it can be quite nice cos you  okay, you we you're speaking to parents and that who've had kids that have gone and died   you're not actually dealing with the kids themselves.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, so it's like dying and coming back!<endOfText>
<bot>It's all the theory of it and erm  hi-tech stuff.<endOfText>
<human>But then  what, are there people that are jus that are already qualified in that or ?<endOfText>
<bot>No, no I'm the first one to go in.<endOfText>
<human>So at the moment, if you've got a  kid with cancer they can't go to Ipswich  or is it just a .<endOfText>
<bot>No, they do but we share the care with Addenbrooks  and  and er  I mean, the leukaemias do but some of the other kids don't .<endOfText>
<human>Look like you was just about to say something then!<endOfText>
<bot>You're just too big!<endOfText>
<human>So you're looking after Gary Lineker's little boy are you?<endOfText>
<bot>No, no, no, no, no  that one  that one's  <endOfText>
<human>He had to have .<endOfText>
<bot>I dunno, he's got a rare form of cancer but  .<endOfText>
<human>Mm, so  I'm very impressed!<endOfText>
<bot>Can we go out in the garden do you think?is that alright?<endOfText>
<human>It was blocking <endOfText>
<bot>It's open.<endOfText>
<human>the door last time weren't they?<endOfText>
<bot>It's open.<endOfText>
<human>Let's hope you should  see my   before.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah , I didn't see it before.<endOfText>
<human>It was a lovely green kitchen!<endOfText>
<bot>Green?<endOfText>
<human>Green!<endOfText>
<bot>Sort of a <endOfText>
<human>Ugh!<endOfText>
<bot>lime green wasn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Oh!<endOfText>
<bot>Mustard green?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Well the front here  this is green  going up the front isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, you get the effects from that don't you?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>It was green and yellow really, actually er <endOfText>
<human>It was a sickly green wasn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>in er  , green and yellow.<endOfText>
<human>What you gonna do with the garden then?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, the idea is  we're gonna have that block  all we're gonna do is make er  this is very ambitious plan here  erm  we're gonna have  the problem with the drive at the moment is if you put one car in it's always the car <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>in front that you want <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>out first!<endOfText>
<human>I like your car by <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>the way.<endOfText>
<bot>parked do you think!<endOfText>
<human>Hey?<endOfText>
<bot>The erm  we're gonna, we're gonna make a drive bit that goes in across where the lawn is now<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>so that you can have one car  there and another one up here.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So, it'll be block paving all up here and around there  and down the side there.<endOfText>
<human>So you, are you <endOfText>
<bot>Aha.<endOfText>
<human>gonna have all this taken out?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And do that  do that.<endOfText>
<bot>So you're gonna have, you're gonna have  get rid of the lawn at the front then  effectively?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And pave right over to the  gate there so you, so that you can get either car out    one one car   and bring up to the back of here and the other two  across there .<endOfText>
<bot>And then, coming through here  take it all the way up    take this garage down  and bring the lawn across.<endOfText>
<human>Are you gonna put another garage up or  just<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>won't bother?<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>I find it's dangerous to be driving your car backwards and forwards across the  back door innit?<endOfText>
<bot>You know, the kids?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, that's true.<endOfText>
<human>So then  you know, you've  you end up with quite a nice er  lawn  oh right!<endOfText>
<bot>You take this up?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Oh and these were the gates were they?<endOfText>
<bot>That's right,the , they were  they were gates at like the front of the house there.<endOfText>
<human>Oh it's had all new windows put in some time hasn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Mm!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, all the windows except the  the kitchen of<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I I expect like yours, they're hard wood and then er aluminium at the <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>side.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>No, ours are hard wood solid but<endOfText>
<bot>Oh!<endOfText>

<bot>And some veggies!<endOfText>
<human>And a sort of<endOfText>
<bot>Are these leeks?<endOfText>
<human>things that I don't know what they, yes, I think <endOfText>
<bot>or or <endOfText>

<bot>Probably er  strawberries.<endOfText>
<human>The bed.<endOfText>
<bot>What's that there?<endOfText>
<human>Are they cabbages or something?<endOfText>
<bot>Red cabbage.<endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah?<endOfText>
<bot>These are .<endOfText>
<human>Mm!<endOfText>
<bot>Looks good!<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Nothing's growing very well in there.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, once you get that shed and that garage down you can er<endOfText>
<bot>Be a nice size won't it?<endOfText>
<human>be quite <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>decent, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Have you been watching that gardening programme?<endOfText>
<bot>Friday evenings.<endOfText>
<human>No, it worries me!<endOfText>
<bot>Oh!<endOfText>
<human>They've had some good ideas though.<endOfText>
<bot>It's quite good actually.<endOfText>
<human>Did you see that one  erm with  where  the, really old boy on a scrap yard, like a, and and then it was like a huge park!<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>He cleaned it up a bit   and a scrap yard and it, and this thing and they were like hills and  rock gardens, you know like <endOfText>
<human>Oh really!<endOfText>
<bot>hundreds of yards  long <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>and and deep!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>This bloke, you know, had been working on it for fifty years nonstop and <endOfText>
<human>Oh my god!<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, Sue Sue wants it <endOfText>
<human>o over a weekend don't you?<endOfText>
<bot>Just give up!<endOfText>
<human>I can't, I just wanna sort of look out the window and it's changed completely!<endOfText>
<bot>Not asking a lot now is it?<endOfText>
<human>Oh it's great!<endOfText>
<bot>Ah!<endOfText>
<human>the old boy .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Ah yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And they build up the old .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah and you don't even notice it do you?<endOfText>
<human>So these cupboards have gotta go on here but the door's gotta go up in the meantime?<endOfText>
<bot>Yep.<endOfText>
<human>Yep.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh right.<endOfText>
<human>,.<endOfText>
<bot>We've still  we've still got a little bit of fiddling <endOfText>
<human>Oh I see <endOfText>
<bot>to do with the  what the  well  we've got  instead of all these individual prints I've got  I've got long ones cos if the <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>floor is<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>very uneven.<endOfText>
<human>I'm gonna fit them.<endOfText>
<bot>But until you finish the  your messing around you're better to leave the doors off aren't you?<endOfText>
<human>What you gonna do on the floor?<endOfText>
<bot>Well we're looking at  we were having a look this morning at erm  that vinyl floor covering stuff<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>would be best.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you want to see if there's some wallpaper in here Mark?<endOfText>
<human>!<endOfText>
<bot>No!<endOfText>
<human>It's er that that we're particularly<endOfText>
<bot>Ah that's er lovely <endOfText>
<human>keen on.<endOfText>
<bot>isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah!<endOfText>
<bot>Got a real sort of er <endOfText>
<human>But it's gonna be difficult to decorate <endOfText>
<bot>around it, you know, and keep it intact but  we'll  we'll try it.<endOfText>
<human>That's amazing isn't it ?<endOfText>
<bot>How people <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>with chi , er tastes are different?<endOfText>
<human>Are you gonna keep this, keep this as well are you?<endOfText>
<bot>I'm sure it was  at one time.<endOfText>
<human>Gotta be, but<endOfText>
<bot>carpet, I mean that was !<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I think the door's nice though!<endOfText>
<human>The thing about this is , it's gonna be a nice room isn't it, when the<endOfText>
<bot>Well quite!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>you know, the garden is done.<endOfText>
<human>Got a decent so you're gonna have this as a dining room are you?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I  I  I don't know.<endOfText>
<human>Well that might just be  you know, like another sitting room<endOfText>
<bot>It's <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>tasteful innit?<endOfText>
<human>so <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah I mean <endOfText>
<human>Yeah I <endOfText>
<bot>Lovely!<endOfText>
<human>mean<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, don't don't, try not to damage any more of it, I mean <endOfText>
<human>No , no I really think of that.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you gonna be able to get some more from the manufacturer to <endOfText>
<human>to patch that bit up are you?<endOfText>
<bot>Patch that together, yeah!<endOfText>
<human>.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah!<endOfText>
<human>And we'll have another fire in here.<endOfText>
<bot>What was that, an old <endOfText>
<human>Yeah and a <endOfText>
<bot>gas fire thingy was it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>If we could get a  you know, if we could open that up  cos we got one of tho th , have you seen the fire in action?<endOfText>
<human>In the lounge?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I like it.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah , yeah got a glimpse <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>of that.<endOfText>
<bot>I like it.<endOfText>
<human>Oh .<endOfText>
<bot>Oh it is, and we put, light the fires  <endOfText>
<human>Nice and warm.<endOfText>
<bot>as well.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, it is nice and warm actually but  <endOfText>
<bot>That's actually gas isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, Derek was saying about it.<endOfText>
<human>Gives off quite a lot of heat.<endOfText>
<bot>And  I think they're quite expensive to run but  it was so nice we<endOfText>
<human>We got rid of that one.<endOfText>
<bot>we thought we'd try it out.<endOfText>
<human>Well the new one was  the new one was  we looked at one in the gas<endOfText>
<bot>showroom when this <endOfText>
<human>Alright!<endOfText>
<bot>thing came out<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>What's the matter?<endOfText>
<human>What's the matter?<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>You're not tape to taping are you ?<endOfText>
<bot>No I'm not actually <endOfText>
<human>I've rewound it once.<endOfText>
<bot>Can't work out how Mark, we'd like to but we can't <endOfText>
<human>work out how!<endOfText>
<bot>Well you just shove one aerial output th the aerial input on the other one I think.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Or video, no, video<endOfText>
<human>No I like it, this one's nice <endOfText>
<bot>output to video input.<endOfText>
<human>I like this.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, it's nice that!<endOfText>
<bot>You've got <endOfText>
<human>It's convenient isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>That's right, very<endOfText>
<human>Switch it on and<endOfText>
<bot>you can <endOfText>
<human>What's that?<endOfText>
<bot>The thermostat, I'm just wondering how it works <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, we know about the thermostats.<endOfText>
<bot>cos there's another thermostat on the  on the boiler itself.<endOfText>
<human>Tell me the difference between a volt meter and an amp meter?<endOfText>
<bot>Well one measures volts and one measures amps!<endOfText>
<human>What's the difference between a volt and an amp?<endOfText>
<bot>The volt is the amount of current passing through<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>yeah?<endOfText>
<human>An amp  amps is current, and volts is  volts !<endOfText>
<bot>Well basically  with a  with a volt meter <endOfText>
<human>Volt <endOfText>
<bot>Right?<endOfText>
<human>you put the  the volt meter across  the  voltage you're measuring  say, like a battery, right <endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>got a battery, put the volt <endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>across it <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>and you measure volts, okay?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, they're fine  <endOfText>
<human>That tells you how much,wha what sort of voltage battery you need does it?<endOfText>
<bot>Well that tells you the voltage of the battery  at that particular <endOfText>
<human>That you're using?<endOfText>
<bot>time, yeah?<endOfText>
<human>I understand.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>So <endOfText>
<bot>But <endOfText>
<human>an amp meter<endOfText>
<bot>amp meter you put in series  say, like if you put a light bulb across <endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>the battery  you put one lead on the battery for the light bulb and then  the other <endOfText>
<human>The other one<endOfText>
<bot>lead of the bulb would go  through <endOfText>
<human>through <endOfText>
<bot>the meter.<endOfText>
<human>Right, to the <endOfText>
<bot>Does that ma <endOfText>
<human>bulb?<endOfText>
<bot>So it'd go  from the, from the battery <endOfText>
<human>And Mark's gone past!<endOfText>
<bot>Are we there?<endOfText>
<human>Are we there?<endOfText>
<bot>Are we there?<endOfText>
<human>And<endOfText>
<bot>If we go from the battery to the bulb , from the bulb to the meter <endOfText>
<human>To the amp meter, from the meter to the battery <endOfText>
<bot>from the meter to the battery , yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>And what does that do?<endOfText>
<human>And that measures current.<endOfText>
<bot>And that measures the amount of current flow to <endOfText>
<human>, when did you pick it up?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh!<endOfText>
<human>Well we had it, got it last night.<endOfText>
<bot>Did you?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Why's that then?<endOfText>
<human>Is that something you're teaching the kids are you?<endOfText>
<bot>We are we we've got an amp meter and a volt meter and I thought they were the same thing you see.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>You've gotta be a bit careful cos if you stick an amp meter  or a current meter across a battery  you're effectively shorting the battery out.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Right?<endOfText>
<human>Cos you've effectively got a dead short through an ammeter whereas a  a volt meter's got a  a hun , a high er  resistance or an open circuit, effectively.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>So if I put a volt meter on a battery it would short the battery?<endOfText>
<bot>That's what you said isn't <endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>it?<endOfText>
<human>Amp meter across the battery.<endOfText>
<bot>If you put an amp meter across a battery?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But the current would flow wouldn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, the current would flow<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>but you would get a lot of current flowing.<endOfText>
<bot>Depends what the  what the a , I mean if you've got an ammeter set to milliamps  and you stuck it across a battery<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>the meter would go smack across the thing!<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>But if you have it set to to amps<endOfText>
<human>Amps.<endOfText>
<bot>then you'd probably get, well whatever the battery's capable of .<endOfText>
<human>But the first time he's hitting it<endOfText>
<bot>See what I mean?<endOfText>
<human>it bloody  hard !<endOfText>
<bot>So you've gotta be a bit careful!<endOfText>
<human>Well why on earth would a school have an <endOfText>
<bot>And <endOfText>
<human>amp meter for?<endOfText>
<bot>all these buttons like the  normal  <endOfText>
<human>I mean, I understand why a volt me , you know, I mean, but I mean, battery's have <endOfText>
<bot>?<endOfText>
<human>has a voltage <endOfText>
<bot>written on <endOfText>
<human>.<endOfText>
<bot>anyway!<endOfText>
<human>I mean, so what do you want a <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>volt meter for?<endOfText>
<bot>Well when they <endOfText>
<human>I'm going to look at  being funny.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Oh I'll be out in a minute.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  if you  the thing is,yo a battery might be marked nine volts<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>but when it's dead, it might only have six on it, six volts.<endOfText>
<human>Left?<endOfText>
<bot>Well if it's dead, it's dead isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, well it's dead yeah but  what happens is, when it dies the volts go down, that's why the the yo your radio or whatever  got  it's operating and stops working.<endOfText>
<bot>Know what I mean?<endOfText>
<human>So if it, if it's got six volts left, it wouldn't be dead would it?<endOfText>
<bot>It would just be<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, it'd be dead.<endOfText>
<bot>Would it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>So what's the point of having a volt meter then?<endOfText>
<bot>Just to find out what voltage you got left in your battery?<endOfText>
<human>Well no, your volt me , I use volt meters all the time at work.<endOfText>
<bot>You make, build a circuit  if you <endOfText>
<human>Right <endOfText>
<bot>wanna test the power supplies you put a volt meter across to measure  cos if you think <endOfText>
<human>So the power is going round?<endOfText>
<bot>No, that's <endOfText>
<human>Well they <endOfText>
<bot>an amp meter!<endOfText>
<human>You just wanna measure the volt, it's just a test meter isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, you get meters normally, the meters we've got at work  and you just turn a knob and it's got  ohms, volts, amps  frequency  you know, whatever.<endOfText>
<human>And they get them on one machine?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, you can use a volt meter as an amp meter if you put a shunt across it.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>See what I mean.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh well at least I know that there is a, a different thing.<endOfText>
<human>It's all, it's all to do with ohms law, if you know ohms law then you'll understand<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know ohms law.<endOfText>
<human>what's what.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>I mean I think  really  new, newfangled things!<endOfText>
<bot>It's really not this .<endOfText>
<human>Oh it came yesterday did it?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh she's sitting in it already.<endOfText>
<human>I don't know, he's got the key but he's not gonna get in.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll have a quick shake, shufty.<endOfText>
<human>It's very nice.<endOfText>
<bot>Well the si , the back door's open innit?<endOfText>
<human>Oh is it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, so you can close it.<endOfText>
<human>Station please!<endOfText>
<bot>Cor this is nice innit?<endOfText>
<human>First time <endOfText>
<bot>Underneath <endOfText>
<human>I've been in one of these.<endOfText>
<bot>underneath there that's your miles per gallon  so as you're  driving along<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>that tells you  you know, how  how you're driving it  and onto <endOfText>
<human>Oh right!<endOfText>
<bot>economy<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, yeah, got you!<endOfText>
<bot>er   been quite good in that one.<endOfText>
<human>Ha, so when you put your foot down the meter goes   smack !<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>There's your lights.<endOfText>
<human>Side lights.<endOfText>
<bot>And what's, is this beam?<endOfText>
<human>No, that's er the  rear fog light<endOfText>
<bot>Oh right!<endOfText>
<human>and those are  you know<endOfText>
<bot>The beam would be on a stick wouldn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>It's on one of the sticks.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah erm<endOfText>
<human>Oh it's nice <endOfText>
<bot>isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Electric windows if we go out later.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, sun roof as well.<endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah  <endOfText>
<bot>You can er  adjust the lights, say that Mark's got in the back<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>put that on one<endOfText>
<human>Oh right, why?<endOfText>
<bot>cos there's somebody in the back  and that's <endOfText>
<human>Oh right, cos of, that changes the angle <endOfText>
<bot>of the lights.<endOfText>
<human>Oh right.<endOfText>
<bot>It changes the two<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, mm mm.<endOfText>
<bot>erm and then you can control the  density of the other lights.<endOfText>
<human>And they go down at  a bit at a time  or  it'll go all the way down .<endOfText>
<bot>Mm!<endOfText>
<human>Nifty, what?<endOfText>
<bot>This is your  mhm!<endOfText>
<human>Oh my god!<endOfText>
<bot>like that.<endOfText>
<human>Is that for the mirrors?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Oh god!<endOfText>
<bot>That's  <endOfText>
<human>Do you wanna drive?<endOfText>
<bot>Take it for a little drive.<endOfText>
<human>No, probably an !<endOfText>
<bot>I mean no,<endOfText>
<human>I wouldn't !<endOfText>
<bot>I'd take any other cars!<endOfText>
<human>No I wouldn't !<endOfText>
<bot>In any other car, I'd say it was no.<endOfText>
<human>Well you took your dad out didn't you?<endOfText>
<bot>I know, but  bit different.<endOfText>
<human>Honestly!<endOfText>
<bot>The steering lock on?<endOfText>
<human>If you were to come back there<endOfText>
<bot>Oh!<endOfText>
<human>all the wa , all the way<endOfText>
<bot>starting up car<endOfText>
<human>We'd better get her out of here, she'll want one tomorrow!<endOfText>
<bot>No, I wouldn't want   .<endOfText>
<human>How long have you been waiting for this car, a while haven't you Spen?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm<endOfText>
<human>Got a huge accelerator pedal innit?<endOfText>
<bot>Just like it covers the whole of <endOfText>
<human>January.<endOfText>
<bot>your foot!<endOfText>
<human>January we bought<endOfText>
<bot>January, February, March, mm, that's not bad actually.<endOfText>
<human>So incredibly quiet!<endOfText>
<bot>A lovely sound isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Erm <endOfText>
<bot>Mm , too right!<endOfText>
<human>How many valves has it got?<endOfText>
<bot>Got sixteen valves has it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, no , twenty six.<endOfText>
<bot>Four cylinders  four <endOfText>
<human>Oh.<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>Even  even with ashtray<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Ah !<endOfText>
<bot>Ah no !<endOfText>
<human>Oh that's sickly isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>That is really smart innit?<endOfText>
<human>Ah that's brilliant!<endOfText>
<bot>How does that work then?<endOfText>
<human>They probably have a big <endOfText>
<bot>No idea.<endOfText>
<human>whole department working on these ashtrays  and then  <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I would of thought  eighteen German engineers just <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>on working the ashtray .<endOfText>
<human>That fascinates me!<endOfText>
<bot>Oh that's brilliant that !<endOfText>
<human>No I like the light because like, as soon as as soon as you put your key  in the door<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>the light comes on, and then it waits until you start the engine  until it goes off<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>and then when you get out  as soon as, as soon as the car comes to rest the light comes on<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>and then it  stays on until you've closed the door and locked it, you know<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>then it goes out.<endOfText>
<bot>No, there's all sorts of remote  to adjust yo you think you're gonna set the clock so you have a little knob <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>don't you?<endOfText>
<human>But you don't, you've got a button to erm  and you just put that .<endOfText>
<bot>Oh god!<endOfText>
<human>I'm surprised it hasn't got a digital one actually.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>I don't like digital clocks<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>I'd rather have it like that.<endOfText>
<bot>For actually glancing down and looking at a clock<endOfText>
<human>It's nice.<endOfText>
<bot>a <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>dial one is is actually easier to read isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Well <endOfText>
<bot>What's sa what's the hi-fi like then?<endOfText>
<human>Mark .<endOfText>
<bot>Not bad really.<endOfText>
<human>Just do one more  when we've listened to it.<endOfText>
<bot>The radio's pretty good.<endOfText>
<human>And the aerial is in  is those two strips on the window.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Rather than an aerial.<endOfText>
<bot>Vandal-proof job <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>you see.<endOfText>
<human>Good for vandals, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>There is is like a break, this vandal-proof thing, if you park in a  duff area<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>You pull them  thing out do you.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>You can<endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah, take it <endOfText>
<bot>Take your <endOfText>
<human>out.<endOfText>
<bot>radio out and and lock it in the glove box.<endOfText>
<human>And they give you  you get four keys  and one of them is called the chauffeur's key<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>and that will drive the car but it won't unlock the glove box or the boot<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, for the chauffeur.<endOfText>
<human>so if you do , you don't want your chauffeur to know what you've got in the glove box <endOfText>
<bot>A chauffeur key !<endOfText>
<human>That's your job then Sue!<endOfText>
<bot>I like these seatbelts at the back!<endOfText>
<human>They come from the other way <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, it's amazing!<endOfText>
<human>don't they?<endOfText>
<bot>They go the other way to normal.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>That's good actually.<endOfText>
<human>They say that's  so that if there's an accident<endOfText>
<bot>They can just get out innit?<endOfText>
<human>then people can er  get you out easier.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh course <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>yeah!<endOfText>
<human>Never thought of that.<endOfText>
<bot>A lot of design's gone into that.<endOfText>
<human>Good old Gerries <endOfText>
<bot>ah?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But it's not <endOfText>
<human>Yeah but this one did as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>These floor mats  see they've got little screw in  things.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, what's the idea?<endOfText>
<human>Just twist the lock and they   <endOfText>
<bot>Mm!<endOfText>
<human>It's a bizarre amount of detail but <endOfText>
<bot>It's got a lovely , lovely gear box hasn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Gear stick on that.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Nice little chunky one.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, it's very nice!<endOfText>
<bot>The Germans have certainly got it haven't they?<endOfText>
<human>But i , Mark you look at this accelerator pedal  it's the whole sort of length of your foot, it's <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>so comfortable instead of <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>that piddling bit that goes in the ball of your foot.<endOfText>
<bot>And you find  you see you've got that little thing to put your clutch foot on as well.<endOfText>
<human>That, next to you.<endOfText>
<bot>Is there?<endOfText>
<human>Oh <endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>god!<endOfText>
<bot>No, go to <endOfText>
<human>the left.<endOfText>

<human>Just about in the ground now innit really?<endOfText>
<bot>He won't let you .<endOfText>
<human>It sounds like a diesel engine so .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah but it's erm   <endOfText>
<human>Didn't he?<endOfText>
<bot>I didn't think , it's not that old.<endOfText>
<human>I've only noticed it  five years, it looks filthy, although it's been in the car wash .<endOfText>

<human>Yeah, it's all the  on the roads innit?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>But you want a Sierra .<endOfText>

<bot>You want the four wheel drive but it's not practical!<endOfText>
<human>Oh!<endOfText>
<bot>So that's gone!<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Ho how far have you gotta go over before you  you get a  you'll get a company car at B T?<endOfText>
<human>Er  head a group  or group leader  quite a way.<endOfText>
<bot>Most of those have got P H D's.<endOfText>
<human>It's er  it's a bit strange at B T!<endOfText>
<bot>And then you only get a popular ghia, it's hardly worth it!<endOfText>
<human>No you don't!<endOfText>
<bot>Don't you?<endOfText>
<human>Or do you?<endOfText>
<bot>Actually, don't forget  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, you a Sierra, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>yeah.<endOfText>
<human>no, then you've gotta  your car.<endOfText>
<bot>Who?<endOfText>
<human>No <endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>so th th yeah, but .<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>But,th he is  you know, he is very, very good about it, he would know from  loads of money and he's  and his company could have a one point six  Sierra<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>you know <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>you don't think<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>but er  I think that  they were part of your pay rise one year was it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah,th they had a new, a re-think.<endOfText>
<human>grading, instead of giving them a pay rise they get<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>And I mean er, you know <endOfText>
<bot>car.<endOfText>
<human>if yo if you're earning that sort of salary, I'm afraid to say, which  you know, the header groups are<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, to drive round in a one point six basic Sierra, well it's pathetic <endOfText>
<bot>It's pathetic isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>really!<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I mean I just think  <endOfText>
<bot>Well, well Mike didn't have one cos he was too tall!<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>And he kept banging his head on the ceiling!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I know, it's tall !<endOfText>
<bot>So he didn't have one <endOfText>
<human>and ma and my group leader he er  he's already got about nine cars cos he collects them  anyway !<endOfText>
<bot>He said, what do I want another bloody car for!<endOfText>
<human>So <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>he didn't <endOfText>
<bot>have one either.<endOfText>
<human>They get a good deal really don't they?<endOfText>
<bot>Well we'll be going to an auction to get like a reasonable car.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I'll enjoy that.<endOfText>
<human>We shall get, you know, sort of, an E or and F and  <endOfText>
<bot>They must, they must be going for rock bottom prices at the moment there!<endOfText>
<human>I saw an E Sierra in the paper for about three thousand that had only done forty thousand  er, an estate.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Wasn't a very good, one point eight.<endOfText>
<bot>But you can save a <endOfText>
<human>lot going to the auction can't you?<endOfText>
<bot>Bit of gamble a though!<endOfText>
<human>Well as long as you don't mind the high mileage cars but if they've been going up and down the motorway all the time <endOfText>
<bot>Not all of them are the high mileage though are they?<endOfText>
<human>.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, a fleet car.<endOfText>
<human>But never mind!<endOfText>
<bot>Well  Mike went to a   we went to the auction at <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>to buy   and had very much in the sports car range.<endOfText>
<human>No , they don't, they tend <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>to be your typical  company <endOfText>

<bot>No, the  command   Look.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, if you did get one that wasn't forty five and you didn't see it, it wouldn't be a problem for the <endOfText>
<bot>manufacturer would it?<endOfText>
<human>I mean er does it just tell it <endOfText>
<bot>Er <endOfText>
<human>to draw a line from one coordinate to another?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm<endOfText>
<human>The pen?<endOfText>
<bot>Does it tell it to draw a line from point to another   Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Well forty five's slightly yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, I think it does.<endOfText>
<human>Cos on here you get you get like quanti quantization steps don't you.<endOfText>
<bot>If you don't <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>you get like a little ladder,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>don't you, right?<endOfText>
<human>But you don't actually see that ladder.<endOfText>
<bot>Nearly finished.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Is it annoying you?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>Well this this curve here's got s steps in it but it won't <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>be like that.<endOfText>
<bot>It l it looks curved.<endOfText>
<human>If you look on this one.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah.<endOfText>
<human>It's pretty smooth.<endOfText>
<bot>No problem.<endOfText>
<human>No problem, sir.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, there's something wrong there.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, it's not on grid.<endOfText>
<bot>What's not on grid then?<endOfText>
<human>No, actually, you want eh, you try it.<endOfText>
<bot>Alright, erase it.<endOfText>
<human>No, don't move it.<endOfText>
<bot>It looks like that  not on grid.<endOfText>
<human>No no no no.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Delete it.<endOfText>
<bot>Sorry?<endOfText>
<human>follow the trace,<endOfText>
<bot>Yep.<endOfText>
<human>Had that before.<endOfText>
<bot>It's weird innit?<endOfText>
<human>Yep.<endOfText>
<bot>What else have we got?<endOfText>
<human>That's why it'd be so nice to be able to w save the work area so when <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>you go back in,<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>you know your grid and everything's all set as it was.<endOfText>
<bot>Especially on Monday mornings.<endOfText>
<human>I find that  incredible that you can't do that.<endOfText>
<bot>Oops.<endOfText>
<human>I just turned them on.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, dig it.<endOfText>
<human>That's a bit close as well isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>What that?<endOfText>
<human>No that's fine.<endOfText>
<bot>It's alright is it?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>It's only if it goes in and you've got no angle <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>there  <endOfText>
<human>yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>outside yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>Look at that .<endOfText>
<human>Well it's gotta be fairly close to that pin.<endOfText>
<bot>Probably doesn't make any difference.<endOfText>
<human>Then it'll be it'll be even with the other one then won't it?<endOfText>
<bot>It's so different isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah but it's got erm <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah but then you've gotta bend all those tracers haven't you?<endOfText>
<human>I've put it there so that it'll look neat.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't see why not.<endOfText>
<human>God Bedge, you are a pedantic bastard.<endOfText>
<bot>What's that?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah I know but John's  <endOfText>
<bot>anyway.<endOfText>
<human>Go to help.<endOfText>
<bot>Hit the help and say page  <endOfText>
<human>Don't you wanna see if you can put page numbers <endOfText>
<bot>I don't think so.<endOfText>
<human>I couldn't find anything for  <endOfText>
<bot>I wouldn't have thought you'd wanted to, that was the thing.<endOfText>
<human>I know, but<endOfText>
<bot>It's cos you're using it for an improper  <endOfText>
<human>You see the way it's done a trace there, sometimes it'll <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>it'll delete that for you.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, it deleted <endOfText>
<human>half of it.<endOfText>
<bot>just check  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>You can't transfer into any other.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>I tried to load it into erm Word and it completely screwed up.<endOfText>
<human>You'll have to move  that one<endOfText>
<bot>over here and that there.<endOfText>
<human>That's got well  you can move that and then you can probably move that there.<endOfText>
<bot>Well do it how you wanna do it, not how  <endOfText>
<human>I was gonna say, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>It's always a problem.<endOfText>
<human>Bedge is the worst one for that.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>You wanna do it like this.<endOfText>
<bot>You don't wanna do it like that .<endOfText>
<human>Oh that's weird.<endOfText>
<bot>I haven't seen that one before.<endOfText>
<human>when he's not happy he comes and re redesigns it all doesn't he?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah he does doesn't he?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>That's what I mean about this  bloody thing, that it doesn't it straighten it.<endOfText>
<human>I'm working with bloody amateurs.<endOfText>
<bot>Takes one to know one.<endOfText>
<human>you we are.<endOfText>
<bot>Bastard .<endOfText>
<human>No you ain't got the  switched on.<endOfText>
<bot>boy.<endOfText>
<human>You had it then.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh hang on <endOfText>
<human>Delete it.<endOfText>
<bot>That's it.<endOfText>
<human>there.<endOfText>
<bot>Er  no.<endOfText>
<human>Ain't too bad is it?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh dear .<endOfText>
<human>Now did you get the the couplers  the right way round on the erm  ?<endOfText>
<bot>That's a  innit?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I've dropped me pencil.<endOfText>
<human>That's alright isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Well there's only sockets going in.<endOfText>
<bot>Sockets are bigger than the chips normally so <endOfText>
<human>No you have to be really careful.<endOfText>
<bot>That'll go in there easy.<endOfText>
<human>If it won't go in stick it in at an angle.<endOfText>
<bot>No if you if you buy a different make of , some of them stick out further and they foul it.<endOfText>
<human>We've had this problem before.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>So it's best just to be er on the safe side.<endOfText>
<bot>Man of knowledge.<endOfText>
<human>Ha!<endOfText>
<bot>What'd we do without this boy, eh Norm?<endOfText>
<human>What?<endOfText>
<bot>I said what would we do without this boy?<endOfText>
<human>A lot more than you do with me <endOfText>
<bot>probably, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos this week he's gonna be fucking useless.<endOfText>
<human>He'll have a fucking racetrack on there.<endOfText>
<bot>He's round every single race circuit, now don't you worry.<endOfText>
<human>Tell you what,<endOfText>
<bot>He's  jobbie he's going whizzing round there.<endOfText>
<human>Tell you what, it's bloody tempting to take a couple of days off work just to burn <endOfText>
<bot>I'm d I've never been this excited over a bike before.<endOfText>
<human>You've got a new bike have you?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Oh.<endOfText>
<bot>Well I haven't yet, I haven't picked it up yet.<endOfText>
<human>You been having wet dreams about it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yep.<endOfText>
<human>Well he hasn't, I have.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh it's so quick to go between  now isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Can you remember the old days?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah you'd think, Oh I'll do <endOfText>
<bot>Eh?<endOfText>
<human>that in a minute didn't you cos you'd think  <endOfText>
<bot>What?<endOfText>
<human>Can I have my seat back then ?<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>What's wrong with this one?<endOfText>
<bot>You got something against this one?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Well it's short, that's <endOfText>
<human>on it?<endOfText>
<bot>It's short, that's  's one.<endOfText>
<human>off.<endOfText>
<bot>one.<endOfText>
<human>Gonna say  er   here has <endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>You're not?<endOfText>
<bot>these the ones we use <endOfText>
<human>Oh hang on, hang on, you went and  didn't you, so we need to <endOfText>
<bot>Done all that.<endOfText>
<human>While you've been fart-arsing around around the labs <endOfText>
<bot>Ah.<endOfText>
<human>somewhere I've done it all.<endOfText>
<bot>I had to go and er see someone <endOfText>
<human>Fucking hell.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  how do you do it without redoing the thing?<endOfText>
<human>Do you just move <endOfText>
<bot>Now there's a reason why I've got this view up at the moment, alright.<endOfText>
<human>Don't tap the screen, you'll scratch it.<endOfText>
<bot>That's what he said to me on Friday <endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>I'd've been inclined to do that  thing on it.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>speeded it up quite a bit.<endOfText>
<human>Do what?<endOfText>
<bot>The  thing.<endOfText>
<human>Oh for redraws.<endOfText>
<bot>And then change it back afterwards.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>If you do  hare whoops, area select, right,<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>you can pick it up can't you?<endOfText>
<bot>Cos you know where it wa where it is now you can just move it.<endOfText>
<human>But the reason I've got this up is because when you do an area select it selects the board outline.<endOfText>
<bot>So if you if we go move <endOfText>
<human>You can  <endOfText>
<bot>Pick the other one up as well.<endOfText>
<human>And then you put that down where you think is the right place and you get really pissed off cos it's moving really slowly and  moving the board outline as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah?<endOfText>
<human>It picks up the board outline.<endOfText>
<bot>If you do an area select alright, it picks up the board outline as well, it selects the board outline.<endOfText>
<human>Why?<endOfText>
<bot>It's just the way it does.<endOfText>
<human>Cos  <endOfText>
<bot>Cos it selects anything that it touches  right and cos it's inside the board outline it thinks it's touching the board outline <endOfText>
<human>Oh cos the board outline is a filled rectangle?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Ah right.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>So that if you have this view up, you can see whether it's selected or not.<endOfText>
<bot>Right?<endOfText>
<human>Oh I get it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Let me show you let me show you again  <endOfText>
<bot>So you then deselect that before you  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah what you do, you area select, right,okay, now if you watch the window  it lights up right,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>and then you go point select  <endOfText>
<bot>and then click here, alright, in open space, and it <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>deselects the outline.<endOfText>
<human>And you've also selected half of that chip.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And you just <endOfText>
<bot>Point select  right?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>And then you just move  I've moved them two cos   Yeah?<endOfText>
<human>So you're happy.<endOfText>
<bot>Why can't you just <endOfText>
<human>Ecstatic.<endOfText>
<bot>point select the er ?<endOfText>
<human>Well yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>If you if you do<endOfText>
<human>Well you can, but if it's been unbound then <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>it's just a load of lines.<endOfText>
<bot>Point select  you've gotta pick that up, you gotta that up and you gotta pick that up.<endOfText>
<human>Or you can select it and then say bind er and then deselect it and then pick it up and move it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah but what if you're really <endOfText>
<human>good with your area select?<endOfText>
<bot>No look, look, look, no.<endOfText>
<human>Area select right, whatever you do   Right area select.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll try and pick up  alright.<endOfText>
<human>Really careful with it but  you still pick the outline up cos it's in that area.<endOfText>
<bot>Thing is, it's alright to tell people but they have to s know for themselves to be sure.<endOfText>
<human>Oh what?<endOfText>
<bot>You cannot do area select  without selecting the broad outline.<endOfText>
<human>Honest.<endOfText>
<bot>That's your project for the rest of the week, is to try and area select  without picking the broad outline up .<endOfText>
<human>I think if you clicked on it and unbound the outline I think you might avoid that.<endOfText>
<bot>No that won't select <endOfText>
<human>Come here, let go.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's try something.<endOfText>
<human>I think that whole lot got unbound <endOfText>
<bot>Well no cos they're all<endOfText>
<human>when I when I I area s I <endOfText>
<bot>What happens is right <endOfText>
<human>selected the whole board and I unbound it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah you select the whole board.<endOfText>
<human>When you unbind it it just stops it from joining all the bits together.<endOfText>
<bot>You then have you would then have to go unbind on the chips to separate the chips again.<endOfText>
<human>?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I reckon  if you decompose the outline  alright?<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>So that means if you picked a bit of the outline up now, pick a bit alright,I reckon if you do area select now  select  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah you gotta select the outline then.<endOfText>
<bot>That's a  <endOfText>
<human>Right, I think you should get all this stuff written up into a file, a help file.<endOfText>
<bot>screen on here is there?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>pages.<endOfText>
<human>Doesn't help you very much though, not on this.<endOfText>
<bot>Manual's behind you.<endOfText>
<human>I never thought about that you know.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean I thought you'd be able to click onto move and hit F one say, and that'd give you a help screen saying to move something, click on it and  move to where you want .<endOfText>
<human>But you know that.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah well it well it'd take up disk space unnecessarily<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>wouldn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Right, you put any text on the outside of the board?<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Haven't you got a file  that you dumped down  saying about ?<endOfText>
<bot>Well come on then.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>That's what you're here for.<endOfText>
<human>What we gotta do, we gotta <endOfText>
<bot>Got to earn your keep.<endOfText>
<human>You're very keen on underscores aren't you?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, it makes it more readable.<endOfText>
<human>.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, what you that for?<endOfText>
<human>It's got it now.<endOfText>
<bot>That's how the old systems used to be with everything didn't they?<endOfText>
<human>Hey.<endOfText>
<bot>Change all that.<endOfText>
<human>That that needs to be updated.<endOfText>
<bot>man, job for you.<endOfText>
<human>He knows.<endOfText>
<bot>Was what you were telling him this morning, was it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Aha.<endOfText>
<human>No you're not supposed to put five in there.<endOfText>
<bot>No no no no no.<endOfText>
<human>That's very   Twenty four.<endOfText>
<bot>Splendid .<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Bob's your uncle.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's have a look at it.<endOfText>
<human>Texts.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>What's  say?<endOfText>
<bot>Two .<endOfText>
<human>Twenty four.<endOfText>
<bot>Now I just wanna  Twenty four.<endOfText>
<human>You haven't got a label on this <endOfText>
<bot>Thing is it remembers the text from the previous one so you can er  just type it in.<endOfText>
<human>It's lovely innit?.<endOfText>
<bot>Haven't innit.<endOfText>
<human>Right   You know you were talking about them deleting all er  references?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Have you considered having holes in the ground and  inside the board one on top of the other?<endOfText>
<bot>Why?<endOfText>
<human>Well then you can put your reference in there and they can't er erase it.<endOfText>
<bot>hold it up to the light  <endOfText>
<human>put me  on the inside.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah.<endOfText>
<human>There's no reason why we can't.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Well why don't we do that?<endOfText>
<bot>Well  It's only <endOfText>
<human>Yeah but you were moaning about them taking er all the detail off.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah that's true, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>There's nothing to stop me from putting it   <endOfText>
<bot>You could put the  in there as well.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So it'd be like  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah but what they do, they've got all the artwork, so all they do is they go over with a black pen on the artwork.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>.<endOfText>
<bot>It's true.<endOfText>
<human>Oh th so they don't take the files and and  them <endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>on a machine?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>Sometimes they do.<endOfText>
<bot>So they just shove some tape over it.<endOfText>
<human>That's a bit off isn't it .<endOfText>
<bot>Oh dear.<endOfText>

<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>didn't I change it again?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>

<human>Doesn't matter really.<endOfText>
<bot>Phew it's lucky I'm on the ball isn't it?<endOfText>

<human>Tut.<endOfText>
<bot>Got this bloody Hotpoint.<endOfText>
<human>Hotpoint.<endOfText>
<bot>You get crap machines and you get problems mate.<endOfText>
<human>That's to be expected isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>I usually have er the the German one before about  five year  but the fucking pump  keep on fuck up every other two year.<endOfText>
<human>So when the five year come up I've no longer insurance alright,er I so i c if I change the pump costs about two hundred  so I s so I said  <endOfText>
<bot>Is that because it's full of chalk or is it cos <endOfText>
<human>No it's not    That kind of machine is  is the water is  they they pump the bloody thing up so far,so your  your washing machi your er blah blah bl your  your clothes is so dry.<endOfText>
<bot>You what?<endOfText>
<human>Your?<endOfText>
<bot>When your washing is when you've finished you you  open the door, is literally er really dry.<endOfText>
<human>You can't see any bloody water.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>So that is why the pump got a lot of problem.<endOfText>
<bot>We have a brand new one   five year erm insurance, part and labour everything   two two year  we notice the water's not pumping off fast enough so the water's dripping backwards.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>So we call a guy say oh yeah, he changing th the er  the pump again.<endOfText>
<human>He changing er er the the pump.<endOfText>
<bot>When we move in here, we get this guy come along to look at it, he say well  this machine the er the Germans erm   they've really  the pump is th is really easy to go, and so I can change your pump for you but l in your washing machine  washing machine.<endOfText>
<human>I change the pump for you, but that is cost a lot of money.<endOfText>
<bot>I said Look, this bloody thing is five years old now,<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>so anything little something like changing the pump, you know I pay about two hundred pound plus his fucking labour.<endOfText>
<human>Is not worth it.<endOfText>
<bot>I can buy a brand new one.<endOfText>
<human>er I want to  want to buy er er  another German one, and then the poxy er spare part <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah but they're er so well made you sh shouldn't really need to have to change it very often.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah but er and also what  I found right,<endOfText>
<bot>Ah!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>only reason I've got one of these bloody poxy Hotpoint because they can fit right underneath  erm into my kitchen unit.<endOfText>
<human>It doesn't stick out, so I can open the door.<endOfText>
<bot>It's not as deep as some others then you mean?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But all the German one is stuck out about what, about inch, so you can't open one the the fucking si side door.<endOfText>
<human>Chop a hole in the back.<endOfText>
<bot>In the wall at the back .<endOfText>
<human>And that is a fucking erm   the   a h a hun a thousand spin.<endOfText>
<bot>So what?the poxy  dry but   you can if you squeeze it you can get er some water out.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>They only give you one year labour.<endOfText>
<human>Well they never make things er bombproof do they?<endOfText>
<bot>Cos if your washing machine machine lasts for thirty years they'd go out of business  wouldn't they ?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah but they   <endOfText>
<bot>Consumer society, you see?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah but the the reason I look at the the poxy Hotpoint because they say well, they guarantee their part for five years, alright?<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>So I say ah, the the part must be fucking good  If they last five year I'm quite happy.<endOfText>
<bot>they last er  for five years.<endOfText>
<human>How long you had this thing then?<endOfText>
<bot>I just got it last year.<endOfText>
<human>About a year ago, February last year,ni ninety one.<endOfText>
<bot>And it's conked out?<endOfText>
<human>It's not co it's still working, but it's  the you can see the the washing is not as dry as it was before.<endOfText>
<bot>Ah.<endOfText>
<human>So it hasn't actually failed, it's just not  up to scratch.<endOfText>
<bot>It's not functioning properly.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah but surely that comes under the warranty then.<endOfText>
<bot>If it's not doing its job that it's intended to do.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah but they only guarantee what  if part is failure, if the the guy come to look at it they still charge you labour.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>Oh.<endOfText>
<bot>They still charge you labour.<endOfText>
<human>So the parts are free but the labour's a hundred <endOfText>
<bot>pound an hour.<endOfText>
<human>I don't know how much the fucking labour is they they charge.<endOfText>
<bot>Bloody hell.<endOfText>
<human>labour.<endOfText>
<bot>And the poxy <endOfText>
<human>Well can't you fix it yourself?<endOfText>
<bot>Just take the back off and and you've only got to undo a couple of clips and take the pump off.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah I know but er if the pump er <endOfText>
<bot>You're just idle.<endOfText>
<human>if the fucking pump's gone, what the hell am I gonna do?<endOfText>
<bot>I'm not buy a pump.<endOfText>
<human>No, you get, well, do you have to have it serviced to get the the free part then?<endOfText>
<bot>No, you don't have to.<endOfText>
<human>But if er if you  <endOfText>
<bot>Do they only give you free parts  under warranty if it's serviced with a ?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>It's a rip-off isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>You don't expect you say look, my pump is gone, give me a new pump  <endOfText>
<bot>Well, yeah I do.<endOfText>
<human>It's a <endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>part.<endOfText>
<bot>And they say how can you prove it is the bloody pump is gone?<endOfText>
<human>Well you bl slam it on the counter and say bloody you know, look in there it's got crap in it, it's not working.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean I've  opened the washing machine up  I mean literally you can't see fuck all  So  fucking big job to <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>what what else?<endOfText>
<human>Looks like you've got  pig in a poke mate.<endOfText>

<human>You've got a water softener as well haven't you?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>But  the poxy <endOfText>
<human>So the pump's working but not works properly.<endOfText>

<bot>I don't know.<endOfText>
<human>I mean I <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>

<bot>But  you got a red light there look!<endOfText>
<human>You go on regardless and there's a bloody red light down there!<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, well I  I tried to get rid of it but  it wouldn't go.<endOfText>
<human>Urgh, don't spit on my cheek!<endOfText>
<bot>I'm not actually!<endOfText>
<human>Erm  going to graphic centre.<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>There's no room for my share.<endOfText>
<bot>Put it away!<endOfText>
<human>What?<endOfText>
<bot>Chaps, integrity them toge <endOfText>
<human>Anyone?<endOfText>
<bot>Did you get your ?<endOfText>
<human>Sorry?<endOfText>
<bot>And have a game of .<endOfText>
<human>Know what I caught on Wednesday night do you?!<endOfText>
<bot>Family.<endOfText>
<human>I got .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, wouldn't be so bad .<endOfText>
<human>Right, solder resist.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, it was true wasn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Oh sorry!<endOfText>
<bot>That's the one I want !<endOfText>
<human>I'm only winding you up!<endOfText>
<bot>Na oh yeah go, go through the solder resist go on.<endOfText>
<human>Oh , make your bloody mind up boy!<endOfText>
<bot>There.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Re-draw.<endOfText>
<human>Right when those  blue ridge  tooling holds up  you wanna put a big resistor down there.<endOfText>
<bot>Two length holes.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, the things!<endOfText>
<bot>I thought that would generate it automatically.<endOfText>
<human>Well it wouldn't.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Why not?<endOfText>
<bot>I thought it was from generator to a pipe, couple of hand brakes in there.<endOfText>
<human>Give it here!<endOfText>
<bot>It's  it's easy to .<endOfText>
<human>Sure , yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, now watch the  burn.<endOfText>
<human>I know.<endOfText>
<bot>Come on!<endOfText>
<human>I know!<endOfText>
<bot>I will clear it up  post haste.<endOfText>
<human>We need some coffee mats here.<endOfText>
<bot>I think I'll <endOfText>
<human>No you <endOfText>
<bot>pick up a load of beer mats.<endOfText>
<human>you're not supposed to have drinks in the cad area.<endOfText>
<bot>No but  I I let you guys bring in drinks because  most  this system on you wouldn't have a<endOfText>
<human>You're not like old er  misery guts then?<endOfText>
<bot>Misery !<endOfText>
<human>Misery !<endOfText>
<bot>Alright, control F seven  Ah that fucking, oh he, oh he's ball right into a decent size at last!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I changed it.<endOfText>
<bot>No, this is still crap!<endOfText>
<human>No it's not!<endOfText>
<bot>It is!<endOfText>
<human>It's great!<endOfText>
<bot>Had it on A columns that's why   two columns are missing !<endOfText>
<human>Great innit!<endOfText>
<bot>Great!<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, you need a solder resist around there  why?<endOfText>
<human>Because, if you'd done  right, the solder resist  they try and put it all over there and it's gonna screw up their manufacturing and stuff.<endOfText>
<bot>You don't want it to cover the old hole!<endOfText>
<human>Right?<endOfText>
<bot>Screws on the .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, cos, the solder just li links into the big hole  and you don't want it  cos it can  screw up the size of the hole then.<endOfText>
<bot>You don't wanna do it.<endOfText>
<human>Have you got anything on that?<endOfText>
<bot>But <endOfText>
<human>Well I don't know a lo , a great deal about manufacturing which is  a bad thing really.<endOfText>
<bot>I need to know the order in which it was  on.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>So you do a little circly and you have it full  Oh that's clever innit!<endOfText>
<human>See that?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>With the to two combined to make it visible.<endOfText>
<bot>And at the front.<endOfText>
<human>Oh we'll just stick it  twenty five parallel, alright?<endOfText>
<bot>Get it .<endOfText>
<human>Okay?<endOfText>
<bot>Good!<endOfText>
<human>It's the wrong colour!<endOfText>
<bot>Don't be stupid!<endOfText>

<bot>If you're sure.<endOfText>
<human>Find out in a minute.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah but  I made them non-copper so they wouldn't .<endOfText>
<human>No, that's the pads, non-copper.<endOfText>
<bot>How's your pad?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>I can't remember to be honest.<endOfText>
<human>Have to check it.<endOfText>
<bot>Should be a sixteen one.<endOfText>
<human>Ah no wait a minute, it's thick, thick, thick.<endOfText>
<bot>Ah !<endOfText>
<human>eighty<endOfText>
<bot>and that one's  fifty<endOfText>
<human>You what?<endOfText>

<human>Don't .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah !<endOfText>
<human>Ha!<endOfText>
<bot>That's alright,<endOfText>
<human>But  <endOfText>
<bot>Oh, I'm lo , I'm looking for parts here I think.<endOfText>
<human>A O, of .<endOfText>
<bot>Or is it one eight six on there?<endOfText>
<human>The ay?<endOfText>
<bot>Next one down.<endOfText>
<human>Are we using the one eight eight?<endOfText>
<bot>No , no, no, no.<endOfText>
<human>Oh we use the one eight six on it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>How you doing?<endOfText>
<bot>With hole!<endOfText>
<human>I thought that was really descriptive.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh shit!<endOfText>
<human>Cos these are exactly the same except with a  well and two erm  those four holes missing.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh this  you'll be there all day!<endOfText>
<human>Okay, alright.<endOfText>
<bot>Bing <endOfText>
<human>Plated  no  spot on!<endOfText>
<bot>I'm impressed!<endOfText>
<human>What about the forty eight one?<endOfText>
<bot>I take it it's   P L C C <endOfText>
<human>With a hole, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Ah, wrong one!<endOfText>
<human>Forty eight, forty eight.<endOfText>
<bot>No it's forty four.<endOfText>
<human>No it isn't.<endOfText>
<bot>That's okay innit?<endOfText>
<human>Excellent stuff!<endOfText>
<bot>Splendid!<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>

<human>That cancels  yeah but  today, I think don't we?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh!<endOfText>
<human>What's next after this then?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I've just gotta make sure the drill template's on.<endOfText>
<human>Oh well, once this is done.<endOfText>
<bot>Well we're both back onto erm  the wotsit<endOfText>
<human>The piston.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh that's quite good.<endOfText>
<human>That's funny, old erm  Colin came in  and you know that one with a  the sort of  screen save and the  the screen shot of that    three- D <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I can't really manage to get a  a .<endOfText>
<bot>I said have a go with it.<endOfText>
<human>He sort of think, you know with the balloons on it, so he go he got the mouth part and urgh!<endOfText>
<bot>Mr gullible!<endOfText>
<human>Right, if we do a whole list.<endOfText>
<bot>Remember VMMT.<endOfText>
<human>VM, MT?<endOfText>
<bot>You what?<endOfText>
<human>Have a  to the whole list.<endOfText>
<bot>Those are plated through holes.<endOfText>
<human>Ah!<endOfText>
<bot>Fifty, sixty?<endOfText>
<human>Ah that's why, fifty doesn't .<endOfText>
<bot>VMMT.<endOfText>
<human>V M  M T  V, I reckon.<endOfText>
<bot>V or B.<endOfText>
<human>Fifty.<endOfText>
<bot>Anyway se these are always named upper case so  it will always be .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but you've already got B there for sixty.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah!<endOfText>
<human>V W or something.<endOfText>
<bot>lum lum la la lum la la lum lum mm .<endOfText>
<human>Oh I know, ah!<endOfText>
<bot>Just type in a minute and I'll<endOfText>
<human>Why's that bill still <endOfText>
<bot>Marking information .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, Bill's got a  an amber light.<endOfText>
<bot>That's right, I can't  see anything in<endOfText>
<human>Why's that?<endOfText>
<bot>Cos it's not quite built?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>What's X?<endOfText>
<human>Right  that one's got the table on  instead of the graphics.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't wanna lose that table, cos I don't want to have to write it all again.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah?<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>So by  <endOfText>
<bot>That's a sod that isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>You do a re-drawing, it disappears !<endOfText>
<bot>I hate people who do that!<endOfText>
<human>What?<endOfText>
<bot>These chair covers!<endOfText>
<human>It's cos they don't sit in the seat properly, they slouch in them!<endOfText>
<bot>Make it drag!<endOfText>
<human>Ah er  what's it like living with you then?<endOfText>
<bot>Great!<endOfText>
<human>Couldn't be better!<endOfText>
<bot>It's alright for me!<endOfText>
<human>Your poor Mrs!<endOfText>
<bot>No, she's alright.<endOfText>
<human>It's an area  area select.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Okay, what we can do, if we  graphics  we bind that alright?<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, then we do  points of reference  and then we do  graphics  name symbol, yeah?<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah I did this <endOfText>
<human>Well the <endOfText>
<bot>before.<endOfText>
<human>You can save it to er erm <endOfText>
<bot>Simple table.<endOfText>
<human>simple table.<endOfText>
<bot>Oops!<endOfText>
<human>Right?<endOfText>
<bot>Enough?<endOfText>
<human>Then you can pull it in.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Okay, so  select a   it's a lovely machine!<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>'s using the ace.  ace for er  PC's.<endOfText>
<bot>And it's quite quick.<endOfText>
<human>Quite good!<endOfText>
<bot>Oh you can get it off a pc can you?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, you can, it's only a  a demo thing at the moment.<endOfText>
<bot>It's quite good!<endOfText>
<human>Right!<endOfText>
<bot>Doo do doo .<endOfText>
<human>Is it all exactly the same functions then?<endOfText>
<bot>Same layout as this.<endOfText>
<human>Slightly different.<endOfText>
<bot>Might be a bit different.<endOfText>
<human>It's bit of a migration, it can hardly turn its head.<endOfText>
<bot>What about erm  thing?<endOfText>
<human>What's it run on  V G A?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, it will run on V G A.<endOfText>
<human>Run on E G A as well I think.<endOfText>
<bot>Can't be a very good  graphics one.<endOfText>
<human>Well I  run it on mine next.<endOfText>
<bot>Can't u , can't use the  right.<endOfText>
<human>Is it the demo you got from Datatrip <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Right,holeless VMMT  V M M T  WS.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Seven inch.<endOfText>
<bot>No..<endOfText>
<human>This to come out.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, that's all the non-plated ones isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Alright.<endOfText>
<bot>Shit!<endOfText>
<human>What is  doing now?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah,.<endOfText>
<human>The er  sump has gone in it.<endOfText>
<bot>Right that's the  the P T H<endOfText>
<human>You're not opening into the file are you?<endOfText>
<bot>No I don't need to.<endOfText>
<human>Don't .<endOfText>
<bot>And you<endOfText>
<human>Old  with thirty fi , thirty five mill <endOfText>
<bot>Bit like mine is it?<endOfText>
<human>Possibly!<endOfText>
<bot>Can't remember <endOfText>
<human>It <endOfText>
<bot>having a thirty five mill <endOfText>
<human>it might be in the centre of the  P L C C's.<endOfText>
<bot>No, they're big holes ain't they?<endOfText>
<human>Huge!<endOfText>
<bot>See they're huge!<endOfText>
<human>Well no, there's a little pad there.<endOfText>
<bot>A pad, it's it's not a pad it's an actual hole.<endOfText>
<human>Oh!<endOfText>
<bot>Hole with diameter thirty five mill .<endOfText>
<human>Thirty five mill ?<endOfText>
<bot>I do , it doesn't ring a bell actually.<endOfText>
<human>Thirty five mill , at all.<endOfText>
<bot>Norm !<endOfText>
<human>Yes?<endOfText>
<bot>What uses a thirty five thou hole?<endOfText>
<human>Erm<endOfText>
<bot>Crystals?<endOfText>
<human>Crystals is about the only thing that would use it.<endOfText>
<bot>Can't imagine what's changed it.<endOfText>
<human>Why do you have so many different hole sizes?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean surely you could have a point eight for crystal and still solder ?<endOfText>
<human>No, well <endOfText>
<bot>Or is both sided, soldered?<endOfText>
<human>The flow soldered if the hole's too big cos the crystals  is thinner.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>It wicks up through.<endOfText>
<bot>Also  erm<endOfText>
<human>It's no problem but <endOfText>
<bot>polystyrene plastics are  are very good  crystals.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>We're not using polystyrene anyway.<endOfText>
<human>There's a thirty three in there.<endOfText>
<bot>Ah, ha ha !<endOfText>
<human>Uses thirty five mill ?<endOfText>
<bot>Wah ah oh oh oh <endOfText>
<human>Oh.<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>It's definitely a thirty five.<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>What would use thirty three Norm ?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, well it's small..<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm<endOfText>
<human>He's trying to think.<endOfText>
<bot>Must have updated the crystals then?<endOfText>
<human>It's<endOfText>
<bot>I think I might have erm  used thirty three on the crystals and now the shape's been updated.<endOfText>
<human>And there's nothing particularly unusual on that.<endOfText>
<bot>Crystal's would be erm  one eighths <endOfText>
<human>And the veers What about the veers?<endOfText>
<bot>They're quite small.<endOfText>
<human>These are twenty fives aren't they?<endOfText>
<bot>These are twenty , yeah.<endOfText>
<human>These are twenty, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Thirty threes, thirty seven  forty six, so  well thirty threes must be the crystals, thirty fives  I don't see what they're gonna be.<endOfText>
<human>er  sha <endOfText>
<bot>What letter are you er<endOfText>
<human>Oh I'm not worried about the letters at the moment.<endOfText>
<bot>Just got it sitting in <endOfText>
<human>Well <endOfText>
<bot>it's never had that before, I'm just trying to work out where it's come from.<endOfText>
<human>Can't you do a  a select?<endOfText>
<bot>Name select or something and pick out a  one of the pads with that hole?<endOfText>
<human>No, you can't, there's erm  I see.<endOfText>
<bot>You haven't got anything unusual that's gonna be small.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh I've got a thirth three hold iron or on the er  crystals look.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, alright.<endOfText>
<bot>Tha , that's probably a mistake in the past  before we had all this changing.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll define  <endOfText>
<human>Cos now we've gone up to thirty fives, I'm pretty sure.<endOfText>
<bot>Just er<endOfText>
<human>They're both the same footprint, those two  <endOfText>
<bot>Sorry?<endOfText>
<human>These two are the same footprint.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>What about that one there?<endOfText>
<bot>Bedge?<endOfText>
<human>Oh that's cute!<endOfText>
<bot>Oh ah <endOfText>
<human>Who got that one?<endOfText>
<bot>Little one there.<endOfText>
<human>I think they should all be er <endOfText>
<bot>I know what it could be!<endOfText>
<human>I know what it is!<endOfText>
<bot>We know what it is.<endOfText>
<human>Er<endOfText>
<bot>What a , what are Zener diodes called, shape?<endOfText>
<human>Which ones?<endOfText>
<bot>Jus Just a normal Zener.<endOfText>
<human>It's not on there but<endOfText>
<bot>Oh erm<endOfText>
<human>It's on the back.<endOfText>
<bot>R four, no D  D three over four sixty?<endOfText>
<human>Is that a normal , a normal Zener one, Z is <endOfText>
<bot>is in some ways.<endOfText>
<human>I think it uses the same footprint doesn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Oh hang on, let's let's  let's do it the easy way.<endOfText>
<bot>It's very quick.<endOfText>
<human>Two, three and a so sixty  that's good innit?<endOfText>
<bot>Whoops!<endOfText>
<human>And si , six, six, six, six, six, six.<endOfText>
<bot>I bet you pound of thirty fives cos  that's a new one  machine.<endOfText>
<human>That's a new component I put on there and that would be updated , yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>there.<endOfText>
<human>That's what it is.<endOfText>
<bot>So all the thirty two's have gotta be changed to thirty fives.<endOfText>
<human>Well , is it thirty three, or thirty five.<endOfText>
<bot>Thirty five rings a bell, erm  .<endOfText>
<human>Oh, find out .<endOfText>
<bot>I can't find an easy one can I?<endOfText>
<human>I could look at the library can't I?<endOfText>
<bot>Yep.<endOfText>
<human>Cos I know they're all up to date.<endOfText>
<bot>You know the check  that went in?<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>Something vague with this split window innit in?<endOfText>
<human>See if they're in the same file and two different bits  two  places on the file.<endOfText>
<bot>It's doing code and you need to change several entries or something.<endOfText>
<human>Mm mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Just split your window.<endOfText>
<human>Brilliant!<endOfText>
<bot>I'm not with you.<endOfText>
<human>Well if you've got a big file  right?<endOfText>
<bot>And you're changing all your currencies of a certain variable<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>you can have it at the top where you've changed it and then the window underneath you can scan it through the file again.<endOfText>
<human>Alright?<endOfText>
<bot>Brilliant!<endOfText>
<human>Nice though.<endOfText>
<bot>You pick them .<endOfText>
<human>Can't you just do a find?<endOfText>
<bot>Can you<endOfText>
<human>Find and replace.<endOfText>
<bot>wait five minutes?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, you probably can.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos I've got something to take over, you might as well take them over .<endOfText>
<human>Can you find the ye , if is there any yellow pads about?<endOfText>
<bot>We've gone right out.<endOfText>
<human>I'll pick up somewhere.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, yellow pads?<endOfText>
<human>You know the  you pull out the information.<endOfText>
<bot>So what were you up at lunchtime then?<endOfText>
<human>Thirty seven is a different one altogether again isn't it Norm?<endOfText>
<bot>Hang on!<endOfText>
<human>Make that the same <endOfText>
<bot>After you <endOfText>
<human>call the same symbol alright?<endOfText>
<bot>I make it the same size  okay?<endOfText>
<human>I wouldn't of thought there's sod all difference between thirty three and thirty seven.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but you have to tell it.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm not ready Norm!<endOfText>
<human>Cos it sees both of those holes in the data range.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh ya!<endOfText>
<human>Hey, I saw this bird Norm<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>That Justin's trying to er<endOfText>

<human>Sorry?<endOfText>
<bot>Come on!<endOfText>
<human>How long you gonna be?<endOfText>
<bot>Not long.<endOfText>
<human>Z three over four sixty?<endOfText>
<bot>Good grief!<endOfText>
<human>On the score  sixty.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm, mm mm .<endOfText>
<human>That's the way .<endOfText>
<bot>That's what we call innit?<endOfText>
<human>What's five thou <endOfText>
<bot>Thirty five thou for the lo <endOfText>
<human>Alright.<endOfText>
<bot>you take three under sixty.<endOfText>
<human>What about  fourteen dip and under school osc <endOfText>
<bot>That's a nice one!<endOfText>
<human>I think that was drill under <endOfText>
<bot>Was any <endOfText>
<human>school table.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you sure?<endOfText>
<human>You sure Bedge?<endOfText>
<bot>Drill un under school osc <endOfText>
<human>What the first bit of that cos the thing in your mouth.<endOfText>
<bot>Fourteen dip  under school  osc Graphics are crap, look at tha , look at that!<endOfText>
<human>Oh!<endOfText>
<bot>Gone completely !<endOfText>
<human>It's not overwriting it is it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes!<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Have you got nothing else to do apart from squeaking chair?<endOfText>
<human>Hasn't bought the bloody letters with it!<endOfText>
<bot>I'm here,.<endOfText>
<human>Dash<endOfText>
<bot>Thirty three, forty six.<endOfText>
<human>fetch !<endOfText>
<bot>Have you <endOfText>
<human>Bedge!<endOfText>
<bot>erased that layer?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah it's all gone now.<endOfText>
<bot>Sorry I'll get the old <endOfText>
<human>Thirty three <endOfText>
<bot>paint pot.<endOfText>
<human>Thirty three is the oscillator<endOfText>
<bot>Right  it should be thirty three.<endOfText>
<human>Well that's what they use in the library so that's a  I'll make sure the library ones are correct on mine, alright?<endOfText>
<bot>What are the other oscillators?<endOfText>
<human>Thirty five is point nine.<endOfText>
<bot>That should be point eight five.<endOfText>
<human>Should it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>So it should be dip , thirty three and<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>What's the other oscillator, that one that's   you lie flat<endOfText>
<bot>An eighteen   osc or something.<endOfText>
<human>It's  H C eighteen.<endOfText>
<bot>H C eighteen.<endOfText>
<human>Alright, we're gonna have to do a well hard copy here.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh shit!<endOfText>
<human>That means we're gonna have to rebuild that bloody<endOfText>
<bot>Hang on!<endOfText>
<human>Zoom in.<endOfText>
<bot>No I think the  I think they're there.<endOfText>
<human>You might find they're with the scrap.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>It's it's  no problem.<endOfText>
<bot>It's found it all has it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, should of picked it all up.<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>I gotta rebuild this anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>What a bugger!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, the erm  small oscillator is a thirty three as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Alright.<endOfText>
<human>Ah ha !<endOfText>
<bot>So there is a difference between thirty three and thirty five?<endOfText>
<human>Correct!<endOfText>
<bot>Looks that way.<endOfText>
<human>I'm gonna delete this one.<endOfText>
<bot>Although saying that  one we sent out to erm  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>they actually drew the wall at point nine<endOfText>
<human>Or point nine five.<endOfText>
<bot>oscillated everything.<endOfText>
<human>The pads are big enough to take it  but when we a , you know that, when we had that problem about the er  what's a name coming up?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>The solder coming up, we decided we'd go down to what  size it should be.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Thing is the th <endOfText>
<bot>The bulk of the drawing rules were such that  you got the pin diameter plus  you know, their  size pads and all this and stuff.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So we basically done to what that is  although they said they were just gonna dri , drill a one point nine five<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>and sort of run it from there.<endOfText>
<human>Well it's a strange fault cos<endOfText>
<bot>Very.<endOfText>
<human>Very!<endOfText>
<bot>They make a big thing about some things, and then some we're gonna drill all that point nine five anyway!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>They made a big thing about us  sort of not using one millimetre holes  using <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>point nine five holes, cos that's standard  size<endOfText>
<human>But that's  that's sod all!<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>We wouldn't have used one mill on the sc for out side counters and letters  they said oh no, they were gonna use wha you know er  what's a name?<endOfText>
<bot>Mr <endOfText>
<human>Point nine five.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Mr  was well upset!<endOfText>
<bot>Phylis?<endOfText>
<human>Well upset!<endOfText>
<bot>Why?<endOfText>
<human>They're gonna  charge him for casting his .<endOfText>
<bot>Well course they are!<endOfText>
<human>He's dying though!<endOfText>
<bot>Poor chap!<endOfText>
<human>If he was get, get in off his death bed  and  in.<endOfText>
<bot>Serves him <endOfText>
<human>And when <endOfText>

<human>The er  people that pay the bills say  oh well that's no good to us!<endOfText>
<bot>What is the use of having this wonderful <endOfText>
<human>Well I <endOfText>
<bot>Web system <endOfText>
<human>Well <endOfText>
<bot>when they don't fucking look at it!<endOfText>
<human>It's supposed to be <endOfText>
<bot>Well how do they know?<endOfText>
<human>for everybody on site.<endOfText>
<bot>Precisely!<endOfText>
<human>The whole system is <endOfText>
<bot>But they're a , they're a law <endOfText>
<human>smooth running.<endOfText>
<bot>unto themself!<endOfText>
<human>They still want a paper system!<endOfText>
<bot>They still want me to send  paper work to say it.<endOfText>
<human>Which we do all that anyway, always do.<endOfText>
<bot>They're fucking useless!<endOfText>
<human>No!<endOfText>
<bot>Wha what happens if the  good come from the store?<endOfText>
<human>You don't have to do any paper work do we?<endOfText>
<bot>I do!<endOfText>
<human>What's that for?<endOfText>

<human>Circuit boards and  tough!<endOfText>
<bot>No, you get paperwork from there.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah but <endOfText>
<bot>I know!<endOfText>
<human>surely that system of paperwork shuffling is is gonna come to end with this.<endOfText>
<bot>Well it bloody should do!<endOfText>
<human>Is it because well the whe whe when they  the good they come from internal store<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>they  that are sent over or what?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh I dunno!<endOfText>
<human>I will just fill out what she wants me to do.<endOfText>
<bot>They'll probably  end up paying twice for it.<endOfText>
<human>Because  I recko , I reckon they must of been paid for that because Maury hasn't been phoning up and saying oh you haven't paid it!<endOfText>
<bot>They've obviously !<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>She usually pho phones you up about a month afterwards, you know  there is a sort of a problem.<endOfText>
<human>I'm pretty sure we must have paid it cos I'm sure she would have phoned us.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos it's got my name on there.<endOfText>
<human>She'd know it was me who got it.<endOfText>
<bot>Well it's not one of these weirdos!<endOfText>

<human>You wanna do it like this one though.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Mm, fucking right!<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, you're telling me!<endOfText>
<human>But , you said you only wanted four lines!<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah I know but if I have, say if I have six lines<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, well you then just go and change them for that one  drawing!<endOfText>
<bot>You can't see with the  th the colour,a better colour.<endOfText>
<human>Like black or<endOfText>
<bot>Ah!<endOfText>
<human>No, transparent's better innit?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>You sure your right?<endOfText>
<bot>I'm sure you got some<endOfText>
<human>That's okay, they're all  pins.<endOfText>
<bot>No, not pins, erm veers and veers aren't a problem.<endOfText>
<human>You can check with the governor!<endOfText>
<bot>Small boy!<endOfText>
<human>Small boy says it's okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Ah!<endOfText>
<human>Oh God!<endOfText>
<bot>Fucking move them to those!<endOfText>
<human>Ah,lol lol lol lol Oh !<endOfText>
<bot>Problems, problems, problems!<endOfText>
<human>Oh er!<endOfText>
<bot>Right where are they?<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Why don't you do a Mark  .<endOfText>
<human>Here  to here, forget it!<endOfText>
<bot>Now, if I  click on there  and see it<endOfText>
<human>Delete it <endOfText>
<bot>you've got <endOfText>
<human>now, but forget it.<endOfText>
<bot>We're not worried about that.<endOfText>
<human>If I erase it I lose the veer <endOfText>
<bot>Ah, cos there's an extra vire there is there?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But it stops short  and the other one overlaps it.<endOfText>
<human>Ah, leave it then.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I mean it's  silly things really.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, leave it.<endOfText>
<bot>Undo.<endOfText>
<human>I don't know why erm<endOfText>
<bot>We should of done these before we erm<endOfText>
<human>Out of the book .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but leave it.<endOfText>
<human>That's cos you had a  sort of go at it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, if there's another re-work we'll sort these out to re-wire.<endOfText>
<human>Tha that's why I'm a bit concerned about  messing around  s straightening and that sort of thing, cos I'm sure  I've had this problem before  I'm sure that it reduces a lot of er<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but you've still gotta do it.<endOfText>
<human>You still gotta move stuff around ain't you?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, well what I do is I delete it <endOfText>
<human>Tidy it up.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>and then I draw back in.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos afterwards <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but then if you run this    your ri <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah but , I think if you straighten lines and mess around with them too much  it leaves little bits in underneath the other one.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah but there's not a lot of difference in the amount of time is there?<endOfText>
<bot>By the time you've  you've moved them all  rather than drawing them all in again  then you run the con activity  and swop back.<endOfText>
<human>Cos you're gonna have to run con activity anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>Well it's just down here  with the plate <endOfText>
<human>And another thing is to  is to  to run con activity before you output the plot.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>But a little short thing like that isn't gonna hurt is it?<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Leave that.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, what else is there?<endOfText>
<human>There is  , that's the er  crystal.<endOfText>
<bot>Yep!<endOfText>
<human>That's good!<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>Which had been forced.<endOfText>
<bot>Yep.<endOfText>
<human>I'll just show you what was on there before.<endOfText>
<bot>See they're not fully connected.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Move back.<endOfText>
<human>Right, okay, let's have a look.<endOfText>
<bot>It looks okay.<endOfText>
<human>Better colour, alright?<endOfText>
<bot>Er, so which one shall we  .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>dunnit?<endOfText>
<human>I can't see anything wrong with it to be honest.<endOfText>
<bot>Signal feed back is  non-reflectives.<endOfText>
<human>Is it because this package has been messed around with?<endOfText>
<bot>And that thing should be a  a bra , a main <endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>pin?<endOfText>
<human>No?<endOfText>
<bot>Right!<endOfText>
<human>Interesting!<endOfText>
<bot>Right, I'll show you this.<endOfText>
<human>Hang on sec , I'll just look in<endOfText>
<bot>Right, it's here right  not fully connected right?<endOfText>
<human>Now <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>the problem here  is  between this point here  right?<endOfText>
<bot>Which is one of them, and I'll go over there, this is one of them.<endOfText>
<human>So the thing is <endOfText>
<bot>And there.<endOfText>
<human>Yep.<endOfText>
<bot>There  right?<endOfText>
<human>And<endOfText>
<bot>There.<endOfText>
<human>there.<endOfText>
<bot>So it's between  it's just on that bit there?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, and also this <endOfText>
<bot>S <endOfText>
<human>this bit here, which  which I was<endOfText>
<bot>Signal being traced, three nine four thousand.<endOfText>
<human>That blue trace there  and this blue trace here  it says there's a problem stubbing it.<endOfText>
<bot>If you mark it, delete it and re-draw<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>there's not another one underneath.<endOfText>
<human>So I dunno why it's  causing a problem really.<endOfText>
<bot>Stubs in signal.<endOfText>
<human>It's not a trace, that those co- ordinates it's<endOfText>
<bot>Bib bib Sorry, can I just interrupt?<endOfText>

<bot>Because this one <endOfText>
<human>As long as it , as long as it goes in<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>onto that thing.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but you really should  I mean A D  characters not traced  right?<endOfText>
<human>You really should check those.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh I have checked them.<endOfText>
<human>But I was, I just bought you down here just to have a look.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh right.<endOfText>
<human>Erm <endOfText>
<bot>I was .<endOfText>
<human>which report bar's that  the Con one?<endOfText>
<bot>I just ran Con again  and to add the new bar  to see if that be back one disappears.<endOfText>
<human>Hang on a minute!<endOfText>
<bot>Er type the  or moor the er  con <endOfText>
<human>You will see more.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos it o , there's erm  a set up safe <endOfText>
<human>I didn't see eighty four before.<endOfText>
<bot>There's a set up that checks  a certain amount of areas and then blanks it otherwise you could be sitting there for hours waiting for a new Con activity  so you just chew them off bit by bit.<endOfText>
<human>Right?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, so that isn't all the problems then?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Ah!<endOfText>
<human>So once you've chewed those you should run it again?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Oh I didn't realise that!<endOfText>
<bot>We should run it again anyway!<endOfText>
<human>Ah!<endOfText>
<bot>So,you gotta run it again haven't you?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Well I haven't had that problem before though.<endOfText>
<human>Cos you've never run it again  have you ?<endOfText>
<bot>No, I do.<endOfText>
<human>No, I do, I do normally I  I'm pretty careful.<endOfText>
<bot>The thing I was getting so pissed off cos I've run it about ten times now, cos you keep coming and do alterations!<endOfText>
<human>Oh God !<endOfText>
<bot>Andy says, oh we've gotta add a new buffer in here so I'm  shifting stuff around and adding capacitors and <endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>De dum <endOfText>
<human>, ay?<endOfText>
<bot>Ah ee!<endOfText>
<human>That's your boss!<endOfText>
<bot>Listen boy !<endOfText>
<human>I don't fucking know!<endOfText>
<bot>How the hell am I supposed to know where he is!<endOfText>
<human>They're looking for you!<endOfText>
<bot>It's like asking me where Justin is!<endOfText>
<human>!<endOfText>
<bot>He's at college today isn't he?<endOfText>
<human>Oh that's good news!<endOfText>
<bot>Supposedly, he should be, yes!<endOfText>
<human>That's different!<endOfText>
<bot>He must love Tuesdays so it means he can have an extra lie in bed!<endOfText>
<human>They don't start till nine do they?<endOfText>
<bot>That's a lay in?<endOfText>
<human>Well to be honest well if he he<endOfText>
<bot>Wanna see something clever?<endOfText>
<human>Go on.<endOfText>
<bot>Little window up here right?<endOfText>
<human>The thing about co-ordinates  why?<endOfText>
<bot>You get a little cross in that window<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>then zoom.<endOfText>
<human>Oh isn't that lovely!<endOfText>
<bot>Look!<endOfText>
<human>you can see it's<endOfText>
<bot>That's lovely!<endOfText>
<human>Cos what I tend to do is I do a full board there  find out <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>where it is and then zoom.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>So you've, actually saving  <endOfText>
<bot>Clicked up on the C N C.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, just turn all items off in that window  all full board  right?<endOfText>
<bot>And then, what a so, you get a huge star there you just zoom around about erm<endOfText>
<human>Isn't that lovely!<endOfText>
<bot>and you're there.<endOfText>
<human>And can you zoom off?<endOfText>
<bot>Experience mate!<endOfText>
<human>Can you zoom in on that window then?<endOfText>
<bot>Or is that always full board <endOfText>
<human>No it's <endOfText>
<bot>type window?<endOfText>
<human>it's exactly the same window as this, you can edit in it,<endOfText>
<bot>you can do everything.<endOfText>
<human>It should go past the window.<endOfText>
<bot>So how do you  how  obviously you do <endOfText>
<human>you have the cursor in here when you hit zoom?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And then you go in there.<endOfText>
<bot>And then yo , you edit box in there.<endOfText>
<human>If you had it in there it would actually zoom that way?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah , I mean if you go erm  if I go zoom here right?<endOfText>
<human>And then, quickly here<endOfText>
<bot>That does that, right.<endOfText>
<human>Right?<endOfText>
<bot>But then if I go zoom in here <endOfText>
<human>Oh I see.<endOfText>
<bot>and I go into that pad, say<endOfText>
<human>Single level three.<endOfText>
<bot>and you can't see it cos I got all items on but <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>you just get a picture of that pad there <endOfText>
<human>So the all items on and off are completely separate from the two windows?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And  is on?<endOfText>
<bot>Yep!<endOfText>
<human>Wonderful!<endOfText>
<bot>I like that!<endOfText>
<human>It's just one of those little things you learn when you working on as many bloody years as I've been now!<endOfText>
<bot>No, I've never used an extra window.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I ha , I do in Ace but not in Bullmaster <endOfText>
<human>It's just a good way to mark it.<endOfText>
<bot>But  ones like this to me, I think they're cos  if you <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>just lay the trace over the top of the pin it doesn't come out.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, that should physically click on the pin to get the wire to connect.<endOfText>
<human>Oh I do!<endOfText>
<bot>Do you?<endOfText>
<human>Mm mm!<endOfText>
<bot>And then do a  <endOfText>
<human>But in terms of, in terms of actual  copper, I mean it is actually  when the, when the plotter goes over that pad that is gonna be connected.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but it's still worth checking though.<endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah!<endOfText>
<bot>But I mean they can be left can't they?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>It's pointless trying to output them again.<endOfText>
<human>And you hear what  say yesterday isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>What's that?<endOfText>
<human>You just only a piece of little metal.<endOfText>
<bot>Ha!<endOfText>
<human>Sorry?<endOfText>
<bot>In lunchtime  you come in here and say  whe where's the board?<endOfText>
<human>Oh!<endOfText>

<human>It'll be alright  on the night.<endOfText>
<bot>Fucking airline now!<endOfText>
<human>Well that's alright innit?<endOfText>
<bot>Hope it's not fucking connected   <endOfText>
<human>Well I ra <endOfText>
<bot>work !<endOfText>
<human>If you go on a st <endOfText>
<bot>If you go on a stat it says no airlines!<endOfText>
<human>How do you account for that?<endOfText>
<bot>What?<endOfText>
<human>You look at stat which I just ran this morning  right?<endOfText>
<bot>My file called stat it says zero airlines.<endOfText>
<human>Don't beli <endOfText>
<bot>Did you just delete that?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>No I didn't fucking  touch it !<endOfText>
<human>You didn't?<endOfText>
<bot>Well what's that?<endOfText>
<human>No, oh.<endOfText>
<bot>Have you put a different file name in?<endOfText>
<human>Nope!<endOfText>
<bot>Just do more stat and it'll say zero.<endOfText>
<human>Total length of airline, zero.<endOfText>
<bot>So I sa , I took it that that was it.<endOfText>
<human>Now more the one you just did.<endOfText>
<bot>I just did.<endOfText>
<human>No, it couldn't be.<endOfText>
<bot>You ju erase it, it won't allow you to over , overwrite it.<endOfText>
<human>Got to take them out the root.<endOfText>
<bot>See so that's why you should check the con activity you see.<endOfText>
<human>Ah!<endOfText>
<bot>You always  didn't I they tell you?<endOfText>
<human>I do, that's why, I always do.<endOfText>
<bot>I do stat, con and  rep after I've done D L C.<endOfText>
<human>No I wasn't  about to go down and  do the bizz <endOfText>
<bot>Tell him off!<endOfText>
<human>Bedge, come on, tell him off!<endOfText>
<bot>You've gotta be able to run a little tidy up programme, we should just get rid of all these stubs and things!<endOfText>
<human>It's like, tell us what's in the software.<endOfText>
<bot>Er<endOfText>
<human>Come on Bedge!<endOfText>
<bot>So you're  tell him off!<endOfText>
<human>Good job we ran this innit?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, if it'll .<endOfText>
<human>Now what was the file you called when you ran sa when you ran stat <endOfText>
<bot>I called it stat I'm sure I did.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Put it in the box.<endOfText>
<human>In there.<endOfText>
<bot>Hang on.<endOfText>
<human>Kick the mother fucker!<endOfText>
<bot>No, woh!<endOfText>
<human>No, hang on!<endOfText>
<bot>Hang on a sec !<endOfText>
<human>I just wanna see if it's been erased since we've been digging around.<endOfText>
<bot>Probably has you see.<endOfText>
<human>Right, okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Point select.<endOfText>
<human>Forwards  er<endOfText>
<bot>No airline!<endOfText>
<human>Why don't you run with airlines on all the time?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I've got confused!<endOfText>
<human>Well if i if it comes up and tells me there's no airlines there, then I can assume that there's no airlines!<endOfText>
<bot>That's right!<endOfText>
<human>It didn't!<endOfText>
<bot>It said there was zero air , that means th there's none  there.<endOfText>
<human>What do you mean none there?<endOfText>
<bot>Well there's one there now cos we just connected it.<endOfText>
<human>If you a, right  I reckon what's happened, you've done a delete on a signal at some point right?<endOfText>
<bot>And it hasn't been pulled up on the airline?<endOfText>
<human>No, you've  when you do a delete  erm  if you do con ex signal, if you have that on signal it deletes the whole signal, airlines and all.<endOfText>
<bot>I always have it on sig as much as poss .<endOfText>
<human>It defaults the sig <endOfText>
<bot>That's, that's usually what happens.<endOfText>
<human>Anyway  that doesn't solve the problem now anyway!<endOfText>
<bot>Oh my God!<endOfText>
<human>So we gotta do the bloody  thing again anyway!<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Do you want me to put this one in or do you want the other one to go in?<endOfText>
<bot>I wasn't told!<endOfText>
<human>!<endOfText>
<bot>Well I  I mean I was, I was  relying on the, on the .<endOfText>
<human>It's, erm, didn't you do these things like  erm  join the numbers up when you were a kiddy <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>You know, in these little books?<endOfText>
<bot>It's just like that.<endOfText>
<human>That says  that said to me zero airline so I thought ah great, it's all connected!<endOfText>
<bot>You know?<endOfText>
<human>Well the con activity test told you it wasn't!<endOfText>
<bot>Well I hadn't got through that had I?<endOfText>
<human>I would have discovered once I'd been through it all.<endOfText>
<bot>Good Lord!<endOfText>
<human>Ooh no!<endOfText>
<bot>Ooh no!<endOfText>
<human>That one's  get it like that  red  well that number's moved.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>It goes blue, green, blue, green, blue<endOfText>
<bot>That's a bit of alive.<endOfText>
<human>Hang on!<endOfText>
<bot>Blue, blue, green <endOfText>
<human>Boo ber ber ber ber ber .<endOfText>
<bot>Right, that's green.<endOfText>
<human>Blue.<endOfText>
<bot>We bring that one red down there.<endOfText>
<human>Doo doo .<endOfText>
<bot>Move these around.<endOfText>
<human>We can go  no we can't cos of that.<endOfText>
<bot>This'll be a good one!<endOfText>
<human>Do you want to do it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I can do it.<endOfText>
<human>?<endOfText>
<bot>Ow <endOfText>
<human>I mean we might as well pitch it now.<endOfText>
<bot>Pitch those plots.<endOfText>
<human>Hang on a sec !<endOfText>
<bot>Wha what's happening here?<endOfText>
<human>That can come right down here and then blue underneath.<endOfText>
<bot>Pull that one down.<endOfText>
<human>Well I just wondered why it goes  there, in<endOfText>
<bot>It could go down one couldn't it?<endOfText>
<human>It goes  hold that.<endOfText>
<bot>Well it's as broad as it's long really.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>That just says a bit.<endOfText>
<human>Mm, no.<endOfText>
<bot>It just means changing it.<endOfText>
<human>This is  the same thing though?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>A bit devious isn't he?<endOfText>
<bot>One things gone down there.<endOfText>
<human>Well Mark did it didn't he!<endOfText>
<bot>Well the problem is, is that you don't like teeing off do you?<endOfText>
<human>Don't like teeing off signals.<endOfText>
<bot>It's gotta be<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, you could of done <endOfText>
<bot>come off at a pin.<endOfText>
<human>So <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah but you could of come across<endOfText>
<human>Well I couldn't <endOfText>
<bot>from there <endOfText>
<human>I remember working on that one and I did it because all this lot was a ,.<endOfText>
<bot>I just pulled it up from that bottom.<endOfText>
<human>Probably this again.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh but you see<endOfText>
<human>It's alright, look<endOfText>
<bot>I mean that one<endOfText>
<human>Hang on!<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but I mean that one  you could of shifted this lot  put some kinks in this one a bit, right?<endOfText>
<human>Moved all that lot up.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah but I don't like putting kinks in!<endOfText>
<human>You could of gone round with the kinks <endOfText>
<bot>It's horrible!<endOfText>
<human>The kinks  <endOfText>
<bot>Well yeah but it's better tha , I mean that's  that's like a bus signal and that's like a ser ,this one that's going round.<endOfText>
<human>Is that now?<endOfText>
<bot>That straight?<endOfText>
<human>What you doing?<endOfText>
<bot>That straight?<endOfText>

<human>Oh!<endOfText>
<bot>No, it's  all naughty and <endOfText>
<human>I find the <endOfText>
<bot>horrible!<endOfText>
<human>if you have the grid on you don't miss airlines.<endOfText>
<bot>I believe you!<endOfText>
<human>There's a segment there left!<endOfText>
<bot>You just make sure <endOfText>
<human>What the hell did that jump across there for?<endOfText>

<human>When I er  when I get the time.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, yes.<endOfText>
<human>I'll have to<endOfText>
<bot>From the Hollies <endOfText>
<human>take .<endOfText>
<bot>the Hollies <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Well  the trouble is they're so small now aren't they?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Because they restricted the area so much  if you got a big plane  that like, to by pass now.<endOfText>
<human>It's all gone again now.<endOfText>
<bot>There was one <endOfText>
<human>Don't have a lot of time to think,You know !<endOfText>
<bot>there was one bloke over in erm  tha you know, with a man la , that I used to work with and he, he used to fly from Hollies , and he lost his plane one day  and fle , flew out of range  and er  he he spent  weeks looking for it!<endOfText>
<human>Couldn't find!<endOfText>
<bot>Because th the  the  sort of corn and barley would, was er was almost ready for<endOfText>
<human>Bloody!<endOfText>
<bot>er harvesting, and he was frightened that  he was getting a bit panicky cos if, you know, frightened a combine had had run over it.<endOfText>
<human>So <endOfText>
<bot>But <endOfText>
<human>he went and hired and plane from Richmond Airport<endOfText>
<bot>Oh God!<endOfText>
<human>Must of <endOfText>
<bot>And th <endOfText>
<human>cost him a fortune!<endOfText>
<bot>this guy flew him round and he saw it!<endOfText>
<human>He spotted it from there and he wen , went and got it.<endOfText>
<bot>Probably cost him twice the amount!<endOfText>
<human>To hire a plane than the  thing's worth!<endOfText>
<bot>Well yeah!<endOfText>
<human>I have heard cases of erm  planes being lost in  in er  crops  chu chur churned up!<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Farmers  aren't happy !<endOfText>
<bot>No I know.<endOfText>
<human>But there's a couple of guys  in another division over there that  they were quite keen on er aircraft and they spent weeks building these bloody things  and then er, and experienced flyer  he'd  taken over to the other, other side of the estate when he had a bit of runway over there <endOfText>
<bot>Aha.<endOfText>
<human>and fly them, and they usually flew for about ten seconds  and he smashed it!<endOfText>
<bot>And they came back for another fortnight of re-building !<endOfText>
<human>He said I saw too much!<endOfText>
<bot>Where's that bloody kettle?<endOfText>
<human>Two weeks after he'd said<endOfText>
<bot>Haven't we  <endOfText>
<human>ten second flight!<endOfText>
<bot>Hasn't Yunny put the kettle on yet?<endOfText>
<human>He's just gone.<endOfText>
<bot>He's just gone <endOfText>
<human>What a <endOfText>
<bot>to get it.<endOfText>
<human>what a lazy bastard!<endOfText>
<bot>I'll bloody steal his notes  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, when I first  I used to fly, actually screen flying.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Tremendous you know!<endOfText>
<bot>I had this plane a  a low four nine engine   and I was only a kid.<endOfText>
<human>I bought it in  village in Mark's Wood I used to take it up the runway and<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>took off and I was circle ground, it was quite a windy day  then this   stood there with me , had no control over the thing, like!<endOfText>
<bot>And it er  I think <endOfText>
<human>I think the engine cut at about <endOfText>
<bot>Well Norm is stepping outside.<endOfText>
<human>Is he?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh!<endOfText>
<human>Is he?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Ooh, my God !<endOfText>
<bot>I'm a man myself, ha?<endOfText>
<human>But er, is he though?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  yeah er e , I couldn't hit, you know, just went outside   and er  what was this?<endOfText>
<human>Er, I went out the next day to go to  er th yeah  that was a Sunday I lost it.<endOfText>
<bot>And before I went to school on the Monday, drove back down the marsh and  went in this forest trying to find it.<endOfText>
<human>And we went round this estate  can't remember where it was  and erm  thought knock on the doors and se , ask people had seen it  and then  later in the day this woman phoned up and said she saw a couple of kids walk down the road with it  and sort of ca , called them over and said oh I heard that his, his .<endOfText>
<bot>So I got it back.<endOfText>
<human>That was lucky!<endOfText>
<bot>And it wasn't broken!<endOfText>
<human>I was<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah?<endOfText>
<human>absolutely  flabbergasted!<endOfText>
<bot>That was a bit lucky!<endOfText>
<human>Could of been a gonner there!<endOfText>
<bot>Could of been indeed.<endOfText>
<human>Drink?<endOfText>
<bot>Well  drop one, they're still looking.<endOfText>
<human>They're still looking.<endOfText>
<bot>No, I  I got plenty of time, I'm not in a hurry.<endOfText>
<human>Cos I  I got plenty of time.<endOfText>
<bot>Still looking.<endOfText>
<human>Is there still the news about  carrying here?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh I could do.<endOfText>
<human>I I I  I think that's one of the options that I could sort of er  I could still be the li , cleaner over here.<endOfText>
<bot>If I ain't got a job by June I could still be here  cleaning.<endOfText>
<human>You gotta take a pay cut then?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah well er  well wo I'd take a pay cut because erm  well I'd have to take a pay cut anyway, but the thing is though, with my pension  with my pension from day one I ain't gonna be too bad off anyway.<endOfText>
<human>If I can take home a hundred and twenty quid  well with my seventy pound a week pension  two hundred quid.<endOfText>
<bot>So I ain't gonna be too bad off anyway.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, sort of er  you know<endOfText>
<bot>Well, it sounds alright.<endOfText>
<human>Probably make a bit more hours, and course there might be er a  a couple of hours a night, it'll probably be  I reckon it'll probably from five to about er seven.<endOfText>
<bot>The proper hours.<endOfText>
<human>And  thing I suppose.<endOfText>
<bot>Well the thing is, I don't think they're gonna put stran , they're not gonna put a stranger over here.<endOfText>
<human>Who don't know the job.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, it's a bit risky for security as well isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Well yeah!<endOfText>
<bot>They're not gonna put, they're not gonna put a stranger over here are they?<endOfText>
<human>Really?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean they're gonna  you know?<endOfText>
<human>I mean, if I sort of just stay  for a, for a while but er  I've still keep looking for work  looking for a job  cos I do wanna get away from B T.<endOfText>
<bot>The sooner I get away the better!<endOfText>
<human>But  I'm not in a hurry at the moment.<endOfText>
<bot>So I can't go anywhere anyway.<endOfText>
<human>I wanna erm  hopefully er  hopefully I can get myself a car once I get the money.<endOfText>
<bot>Buy one.<endOfText>
<human>Weren't gonna splash it all out  you know?<endOfText>
<bot>All at once?<endOfText>
<human>No I wouldn't splash it all out but I'd get quite a bit cos of the twenty years.<endOfText>
<bot>I've still got my, er get a car for about a couple of grand.<endOfText>
<human>Get a second hand car for a couple of grand and er  I'll still have a little bit.<endOfText>
<bot>We might pay some of the mortgage off and er er, if there's any  you know, we sort of keep some in there.<endOfText>
<human>Keep some in the <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>building society.<endOfText>
<bot>At least, at least if I had another job you see and er  well I'm taking home two hundred odd  two hundred pound a week.<endOfText>
<human>Well I worked out a hundred and twenty here and seventy pound pension.<endOfText>
<bot>I wouldn't need to touch that money.<endOfText>
<human>That'd still be erm  that'd still be in the er  still be in the building society could be making me money.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I mean er<endOfText>
<bot>You get some er  the old interest <endOfText>
<human>There's the <endOfText>
<bot>can't you?<endOfText>
<human>Well especially if you put it in your high interest.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Which once I've wo , which I will.<endOfText>
<bot>The trouble is with high interest account you can't get the money out very quickly can you?<endOfText>
<human>Ah?<endOfText>
<bot>You can't get the money out very quickly.<endOfText>
<human>Just give them plenty of notice like er a month's notice to get the money out.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh well, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>That er<endOfText>
<bot>So if you need it in a hurry it can be a problem.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Well we could have it in a ordinary account it's sa , still sort of er  .<endOfText>
<human>You know?<endOfText>
<bot>Just report or not.<endOfText>
<human>I might be able to some in er, in the ordinary account and some in the high interest account.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>You could do that can't you?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah, split it up as you like!<endOfText>
<human>Oh!<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah, but er  but I'm not in a hurry anyway.<endOfText>
<human>I've got plenty of time.<endOfText>
<bot>John!<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Your tea cup got  .<endOfText>
<human>How dare you !<endOfText>
<bot>Phone!<endOfText>
<human>Okay, boy  <endOfText>
<bot>Oy, slaphead!<endOfText>
<human>Me?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, the chap from  Arkworth Generation for you.<endOfText>
<human>Excellent!<endOfText>
<bot>I'm not sure  this machine  the actual driver board  can  I know.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Because I've been trying to swop  between that one and that one.<endOfText>
<human>In that we see  the one coloured drive right?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>We can re resist the and run from  to that  copy.<endOfText>
<bot>When Bedge got it in I say look le I I wanna swop it see what happen.<endOfText>
<human>And I took, he swop it  he he wouldn't  three sixty two.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>I'm not sure, is it the driver  that's the problem or not?<endOfText>
<bot>So  you may have to ask Norman if it'll now work.<endOfText>
<human>I think we will blame the or th all got in, got in.<endOfText>
<bot>We will have some money left behind  not a lot.<endOfText>
<human>Cos the machines in my old office  all of them, all the five and a quarters agree  both types.<endOfText>
<bot>And the three and a halfs agreed with seven twenties.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah!<endOfText>
<human>I mean this one can   <endOfText>
<bot>I mean what is  what's the point in a, in a drive that'll rig one point two but not three sixty?<endOfText>
<human>Useless!<endOfText>
<bot>And erm  the one I got, in there  can rig well three sixty K and one point two meg, no problem!<endOfText>
<human>As soon as I charge straight into here, what happen with it?<endOfText>
<bot>I think it's something to with the, with the actual er  driver board.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>And you get all set one wha erm  setting.<endOfText>
<human>You gonna have, you can't have a few.<endOfText>
<bot>So we may have a, quite another a board or what?<endOfText>
<human>I don't know.<endOfText>
<bot>They will let you know.<endOfText>
<human>They'll have to!<endOfText>
<bot>If I could get my .<endOfText>
<human>Then I could have that machine and Justy can have mine.<endOfText>
<bot>One.<endOfText>
<human>What I'm trying to say is that yo ,i now you gotta order another to , forty six.<endOfText>
<bot>How do I know what's having ?<endOfText>
<human>Who's getting the other one then?<endOfText>
<bot>I dunno.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>I have a lot of feeling  right?<endOfText>
<human>That's it's .<endOfText>
<bot>When these boys has come along  and Colin would  he look at John  and what do boys say?<endOfText>
<human>Well he can't have yours cos he's not doing  compiling that <endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>needs  fast processing time.<endOfText>
<bot>Tony is the one who will definitely jump up and fucking , but I tell him to fuck off!<endOfText>
<human>But Colin  I mean <endOfText>
<bot>Frank said to you you can have <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>cos you need it for your work!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but  Frank did tell me to keep it, keep quiet!<endOfText>
<bot>Don't make any  don't make war!<endOfText>
<human>I don't know it, so I keep quiet.<endOfText>
<bot>Don't make  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah but as soon as he walks in here he'll go, ah new machine!<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>How's that then?<endOfText>
<bot>Well you'll have to convince that it's, it's  just a three eight six.<endOfText>
<human>Cor God!<endOfText>
<bot>That amazes me why people, it's like a status symbol they have to have the best bloody machine!<endOfText>
<human>Well there's no point!<endOfText>
<bot>But, I have Bedgey look  to be honest right  he do more compiling than me.<endOfText>
<human>If he want the forty six  , I mean the forty six I give you  this.<endOfText>
<bot>And he, and he say ah no, but it's alright I got my .<endOfText>
<human>But, he said if if Franky order another one  he say, I shall have a forty six.<endOfText>
<bot>Be , originally  they order two forty sixes  one for Colin and one for Andy.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>But  when the money tight and they, they can't get the bloody thing!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, well you haven't got it yet anyway have you so<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I will, I will get it  and all the  will come in here  and we'll hide it or  whereby  no no, no one will fucking see it!<endOfText>
<human>And go, I set it up all working and there's fuck  oh ho!<endOfText>
<bot>It is isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Oh what a pity!<endOfText>
<bot>Can you stick in that box?<endOfText>
<human>But the thing is, they look so different.<endOfText>
<bot>Don't they?<endOfText>
<human>And like Ian's four eight sixes, it's so different to one of those it's not like you can get away with it.<endOfText>
<bot>Completely different, re-designed box and everything.<endOfText>
<human>You still using that monitor?<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Wo , have a look at this monitor?<endOfText>
<bot>Ay?<endOfText>
<human>Come here, it's your monitor, everything.<endOfText>
<bot>So I can have that monitor with that machine, ha?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, you, you can get everything.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh right.<endOfText>
<human>But we asked erm  Colin,di did he want a monitor?<endOfText>
<bot>And he say no!<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Th , the super V G A is better than the, just the V G A.<endOfText>
<human>They can give you twe , two hundred  two hundred and er, fifty six colour.<endOfText>
<bot>So <endOfText>
<human>Is this V G A or E G A?<endOfText>
<bot>That's a Philips, a V G A.<endOfText>
<human>Is it?<endOfText>
<bot>It's a normal, it's like your one, it's normal V G A.<endOfText>
<human>Oh!<endOfText>
<bot>Sixteen colour.<endOfText>
<human>If you open tha ,ma my window, the picture is  compared with the wha you put in  there .<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah.<endOfText>
<human>So I don't know  what is going on!<endOfText>
<bot>So I'm not  over exciting .<endOfText>
<human>A Bloody politics place !<endOfText>
<bot>Well you got a valid reason for having a fast machine.<endOfText>
<human>Right!<endOfText>
<bot>I better get the  out then.<endOfText>
<human>And my bloody !<endOfText>
<bot>Ow!<endOfText>
<human>Well, and I put an order in to buying erm  two more of these five and a quarter inch.<endOfText>
<bot>It'll rebo <endOfText>
<human>Mm?<endOfText>
<bot>That will,wi tha tha will rebo soft.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but  I think th , probably the thing with number<endOfText>
<bot>Then the driver innit?<endOfText>
<human>Well if it can't, it can't.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah well there's a problem with that because they might be on different project number mighten they?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah but doesn't matter!<endOfText>
<bot>In this group, doesn't matter.<endOfText>
<human>In other group, maybe.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>In this group ,.<endOfText>
<bot>So if you want a se see er er a normal reception you want some  some level if you want what?<endOfText>
<human>One.<endOfText>
<bot>If you wanna thick one   want a monitor  this way,, but not a lot.<endOfText>
<human>So you don't wanna put all that in.<endOfText>
<bot>But it does  or some order.<endOfText>
<human>But whereas anyone order from this company say well    what do you want?<endOfText>
<bot>Do you want a big one or a small one?<endOfText>
<human>If you want a huge order  oh you can look for your own.<endOfText>
<bot>When Len  sent them a five pound order, or ten pound<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>you can leave that .<endOfText>
<human>Th there is a  if there is work in our group, no problem!<endOfText>
<bot>As soon as we've been , all been  <endOfText>
<human>We'll have to  write that one with a  indelible pen.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>You only get on go at it as well.<endOfText>
<bot>So that is<endOfText>
<human>I dunno, you get it off with spirit I suppose.<endOfText>
<bot>Maybe, I think you can get erm  erm  in, what they done on Norman's   they're using a tape.<endOfText>
<human>A tape?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh that's messy!<endOfText>
<human>Er well  if you're gonna draw the line I mean  I mean it's bloody  we know what  who's in, who's out.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, have a chat with Norman.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>The only problem is, I dunno if there's a mistake on this but this modem box  right?<endOfText>
<bot>Is one six one  and this is  it's ha!<endOfText>
<human>You're hoping!<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>It's not going into anything is it?<endOfText>
<bot>No, it isn't, it's not got a socket or anything right?<endOfText>
<human>It'll have <endOfText>
<bot>Norm!<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>it'll have four<endOfText>
<human>How do you change<endOfText>
<bot>Look likes   the actual box is one six one, this is one sixty right?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos I put erm<endOfText>
<human>So that's gonna be  a bit small, but <endOfText>
<bot>a dimension in there.<endOfText>
<human>we're not gonna have these connectors on  so we all can do whatever size we want really can't we?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Talk to me!<endOfText>
<bot>Cli ,wha what's the depth?<endOfText>
<human>The depth is erm<endOfText>
<bot>six four one.<endOfText>
<human>four one.<endOfText>
<bot>So how big's that?<endOfText>
<human>That will take us  is it clear up <endOfText>
<bot>Oh right!<endOfText>
<human>to there, to here.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Well what we can do<endOfText>
<human>No, what we'll do first  ride <endOfText>
<bot>is put in a connector, you know those connectors?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>That these fellers are on?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>You can get them with long pins each si have them standing up the board  and then you have another board, a board with a   so you can<endOfText>
<human>That's what I was saying!<endOfText>
<bot>cut the pillars  those there.<endOfText>
<human>Perhaps, yeah we might find that by the time we got to  might not be able to get it all on.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos that  is like  a sixth of the area isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>What we'll do  alright?<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>I reckon .<endOfText>
<bot>If we erm  I'll get a  if I got time today.<endOfText>
<human>Alright?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, so basically<endOfText>
<human>Then, yeah, we'll just try and get through today.<endOfText>
<bot>Start , see what the  actually gonna do.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, like , yeah?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean all the chips will fit, but you gotta .<endOfText>
<human>Am I that boring Frank?<endOfText>
<bot>I didn't <endOfText>
<human>Yeah  !<endOfText>
<bot>say anything you know!<endOfText>
<human>No, not half!<endOfText>
<bot>I didn't.<endOfText>
<human>But I di , I didn't realise that I thought you were  actually.<endOfText>
<bot>How old did you think I am?<endOfText>
<human>What an insult!<endOfText>
<bot>Erm<endOfText>
<human>He's not that old are you?<endOfText>
<bot>No, no .<endOfText>
<human>I suppose about be erm  fifty nine.<endOfText>
<bot>No, no no no, I'm .<endOfText>
<human>Erm, so you had to have  didn't you?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, I , yes.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah,yo , we well we won't do that .<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, I probably do all that but I don't .<endOfText>
<human><endOfText>
<bot>services.<endOfText>
<human>Now we've got this year, certainly it will succeed in years and pay, pay the interest off, that will re result in a  any more money  your own debt.<endOfText>
<bot>The S S A will be controlled as it is at present.<endOfText>
<human>I see us put into  on that sort of thing.<endOfText>
<bot>What we  we got a result over that.<endOfText>
<human>Interest rates will go up.<endOfText>
<bot>In the past when they've gone up, under the conservatives, we welcomed that thus slashing fourteen per cent,money out of the market and as they said, two million pounds against eight hundred thousand.<endOfText>
<human>That is going to change, of course.<endOfText>
<bot>As money goes up, er, you can you can negotiate figures<endOfText>
<human>Interest.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, then that was at a higher level than at present, but we're not going to take on at ten per cent interest.<endOfText>
<human>That's five or six per cent on the debt .<endOfText>
<bot>So you're gonna pay more for that.<endOfText>
<human>The whole thing, reminds me a little bit of each  when I had to get my  thousand pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>You're lucky you got one.<endOfText>
<human>It says on it, you can pay two hundred pounds, or over three years, or you can pay ten pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>Who decided, Mr Chairman, to pay the ten pounds, you were lucky really, you have to pay the two hundred pounds, that'll be the <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, well, thank you Chairman, I I I'm erm er, I must admit, I'm I I am think long and and and er think deep really, about er, you know, changes such as this, but I I also er, er have to run my own businesses, and er, I just er, I think we have experienced a water-shed, it's coincided to some extent with the change of administration and then during the nineteen eighties, we had to a boom in this county, we had the the opportunity and I never er ever er, been against that principle, of er, of er, using our actual receipts we have hidden reserves, we we talked about the reserves of twenty nine million pounds here, for the er, erm, we have er er, assets of twenty nine million, in an earlier paper.<endOfText>
<bot>And then we all know, that that that er er considerable assets there, which are there, and and and we're we're we're very grateful for them, we are in a very fortunate position.<endOfText>
<human>But, we have interest rates at the lowest rate they've been, well, in my memory, really, in terms of er er my time in business, and they may even go down a further one per cent.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, and that coincides as well, with er, unfortunate situation, where we've erm,<endOfText>
<human>we're still in the in the recession.<endOfText>
<bot>I heard that that er er er parts of the rest of the U K property prices have risen over the last year, er but ours have actually not risen at all.<endOfText>
<human>In fact, they've gone down.<endOfText>
<bot>Lincolnshire and Humberside, and so er er I've no doubt in my mind that there will be opportunities available to us, er through further capital receipts, in the foreseeable future.<endOfText>
<human>But those won't, er if we were to take cashing those in now, it would be probably taking half of what we might get for them in the future, and from a business proposition, there is a time, when even if you have money in the bank, there are times, when it would be very advantageous to take  long term interest rates, at low interest rates, and I think er er this is er perhaps the best opportunity that we have.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, also, we don't forget that er, we, whilst people say to me, er we had a good year on the P S G last year and we've had some good settlements, perhaps over the year, better than average, in the East Midlands, on the P S G. But we have so much catching up to do.<endOfText>
<human>We're light years behind some of those areas where the spending has been at a much higher level.<endOfText>
<bot>So we don't want to be any under any illusions about that, and the same can be applied to the fact that we have made no real provision for nursery education, that we were in trouble over special needs in this county, that was a a requirement to to restore services that were well below the S S A on Social Services, and we really all this er this er, new administration has done, has been brought those up, those services up to what would have been regarded as a quite an unacceptable level with most of the the the authorities in this country.<endOfText>
<human>It's been a  up, in fact, you've been living off the people, in in in other words.<endOfText>
<bot>Really, in terms, of<endOfText>
<human>providing, and you've been living off capital in that way, and and and I'm not prepared to do that, but I do think there is strong case for borrowing, er, providing it's kept in in that in in er er under control at this time, and borrowing, I may feel that we will be able to be in a much better position to take our capital receipts and use them advantageously in the future.<endOfText>
<bot>I have no doubt about it that the government are urging us at this moment, er I I am concerned about that, they are urging us by the er<endOfText>
<human>approvals to do to go down this road.<endOfText>
<bot>I I I don't want to go down the road to the same extent that they've done, when they put us into debt by fifty er fifty billion o o o o o o o just on on on one day, but I'm sure that there is a a strong case to look<endOfText>
<human>and to pursue the options that are are available to us, and that's what I hope the Treasurer will do, er, and this is all we're approving at the moment, and that an an and to find out just what the, how the land lies, what the best position is, what interest rates that we might be able to get, and over what period and I I I er support this er er er er this expense bud budget.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you Mr Chairman.<endOfText>
<human>Er, this is basically about fairness and equality.<endOfText>
<bot>Fairness the people who willingly to cheer now.<endOfText>
<human>Er, to expend money on a project over, that is going to last thirty forty years, and expect the people today to pay for it.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, when their paying for it, not necessarily with money, but in some cases with their lives, with misery.<endOfText>
<human>These are the things that they're having to pay for it with, and the reason being, is the Social Services in this county were a diabolically low level, and people were definitely suffering from it.<endOfText>
<bot>The people of this county, were suffering from it, through crying, because of the lack of crime prevention work being done by the previous administration, because the money was all going one way.<endOfText>
<human>I'd like to ta look round this room.<endOfText>
<bot>Everybody has homes.<endOfText>
<human>How many people of the , how many of you here today, could actually pay for your home out of your income, if you waited until you have sufficient income to pay for your home in its entirety, the bulk of the people in this room, even though there are, yes, some rich farmers, still couldn't afford to have a home.<endOfText>
<bot>These are the types of things, that you have failed to look at.<endOfText>
<human>Central Government is encouraging us to borrow, and I was pleased to hear Councillor  on papery actually accept that borrowing under F T C was acceptable.<endOfText>
<bot>I didn't do anything, I don't know what you are talking about.<endOfText>
<human>How ac you're unsure<endOfText>
<bot>I said, well if governments daft enough to borrow, that's their business, I was <endOfText>
<human>Mr Chairman, er the actual words were, S T D, S T C's are a separate thing when we are borrowing on governments behalves.<endOfText>
<bot>And that was his exact words.<endOfText>
<human>So he supports them borrowing, but how many farmers in this country, or in this county don't have a loan.<endOfText>
<bot>I would think very very few.<endOfText>
<human>We are looking for fairness, and that is what we're going to deliver.<endOfText>
<bot>Perhaps I was saying too much.<endOfText>
<human>Councillor Brock is the Vincent Price of our councillors, with his horror stories,<endOfText>
<bot>Anybody that borrows money for a capital project is in is in the mad-house.<endOfText>
<human>He should be in the mad-house, which worries me, because I, to follow the point that councillor Taylor's made.<endOfText>
<bot>I borrowed a modest amount to buy my house, that I could easily meet within the finances that I'm getting at the moment.<endOfText>
<human>And that's all the same that the County Council are going to do.<endOfText>
<bot>They're going to lend money for long term projects, and the people of Lincolnshire, who benefit through those projects for years to come, will be paying modestly for years to come.<endOfText>
<human>That way, we are providing those front line services, that Councillor Taylor picked upon and Councillor Parker mentioned, such as Social Services that had been, that that literally been fleeced by the previous administration to pay for their capital projects.<endOfText>
<bot>We will put in the front line services, such as Social Services.<endOfText>
<human>I hope we will borrow very modestly, it'll be affordable, we're not reckless, we'll be doing what the majority of people in this country do, borrow within their limits for the things that they need for the future such as a home, or a car, something like that.<endOfText>
<bot>It's nothing to be frightened about, it's not something new, as been stated.<endOfText>
<human>Borrowing is, does not re , is not a new thing for us.<endOfText>
<bot>We we do that in terms of of of capital control for Translink and Computer Services, and it's interesting to note that we don't class as a debt free authority, so what we have is a number of scare stories from Vincent over there, which is irresponsible.<endOfText>
<human>This is a sound tool in our management  toolbox, and I recommend it.<endOfText>
<bot>Good job this meeting's being recorded, Mr Chairman.<endOfText>
<human>We should have a play-back in four years time.<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor <endOfText>
<human>Thank you, Mr Chairman, it it's certainly very interesting this morning, er listening to the various points that have been put forward by er the new administration.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, all speaking with an air of running business, managing finance and er how we haven't managed in the past because this is what, our actual <endOfText>
<human>It is really, it's a philosophy, isn't it, over the last how many years, you don't have this philosophy, about being in fear of long term debt in in this authority.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think capital  not the way the average  them that work.<endOfText>
<human>Better to be in philosophy than have the facilities  which has greatly benefited the charge payers and the people who think  right across the board.<endOfText>
<bot>Right across the board.<endOfText>
<human>I I mean, I find it, I find it quite amusing when some of the er labour people  their services.<endOfText>
<bot>I travelled the country  well, I've been in other authorities both labour controlled, been in to schools, been in old peoples homes, erm seen their roads, or driven over their roads, and I can assure you, that er  in Lincolnshire.<endOfText>
<human>I think you know, Lincolnshire has done a dam good job for the people in Lincolnshire  whether it in roads, whether it be old peoples homes, or whether it be in schools, whether it be in fire stations, police stations, I admit to  where one could say across the board, they could compare, that they could compare, they might compare they might live in one area and work in another.<endOfText>
<bot>One could go into Cambridgeshire and some of the various levels of development what they have got<endOfText>
<human>Cambridgeshire roads, and you know very well that they they don't compare to Lincolnshire roads,County boundary.<endOfText>
<bot>You go into various parts of the er south west, where their labour control  and you look at the state of their buildings, and you think, my God, what on earth have the elected members been doing when you actually see the level of rates that they have set.<endOfText>
<human>And then, I mean, the amount of long term capital debts they all got.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, it it's a matter of whether you want to spend today and pay later, or whether you want to continue a philosophy is mainly in the majority of Lincolnshire vote, that if you want something, you pay for it.<endOfText>
<human>If you haven't got the money, you go without.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, we are providing above average level of services year on year on, at below average, er er average  expenditure.<endOfText>
<human>For the simple reason that we have no debt to finance, we have no debts to finance, and if we'd listened to you over the years, on our sur surplus land and property.<endOfText>
<bot>Selling off the family silver.<endOfText>
<human>The times that has come out of your mouths.<endOfText>
<bot>Selling off the family silver, and look what we're gonna have to do with that year  You have criticised those for setting up the various units, and giving them target  for.<endOfText>
<human>You have criticised those for looking after, Councillor Clark, I didn't talk when you were talking, and I thought you'd want to listen to what I'm saying, because er, I think you could learn a lot.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, I was hoping you  <endOfText>
<human>Mr Chairman, I take  to a conclusion <endOfText>
<bot>Mr Chairman, if this  for negotiators of these  and if you look at th the papers of the  budget this year, er because of conservative policies don't improve, you haven't actually inherited about ten million pounds coming in to your budget during the year.<endOfText>
<human>Now, you have been spending, since May like water.<endOfText>
<bot>You have  unspend, you have spent, and you actually spent more than we've got in some instances.<endOfText>
<human>You make commitments for next year, as as if , money had gonna be no object.<endOfText>
<bot>You your criticising the the government is not giving you as much grant as you would like.<endOfText>
<human>You'll have to remember that the that the er increase from last year, it's an increase, it's not a cut, not talking about cuts.<endOfText>
<bot>There is no reduction from Central Government from last year to to to from this year, to next year, and you have been totally unrealistic,the two of you, the labour and the liberal parties after May, erm, we've gotta this, we've gotta that.<endOfText>
<human>As as if money would just come whenever you open your mouths.<endOfText>
<bot>You are at last realising the folly of what you set out to do.<endOfText>
<human>and as Councillor  said.<endOfText>
<bot>Here we are, in a matter of what eight to nine months of inheriting, a well financed, a well run, an effective, efficient organisation with a reasonable amount of na balances.<endOfText>
<human>With a capital investment fund, and yet here you are trying to have to borrow to be able to manage next year.<endOfText>
<bot>I think it's an absolute disgrace.<endOfText>
<human>I think it's a sad day for  in Lincolnshire, and you know, if you start as, I think Councillor  said, to er, agree with this er proposal today, it is, it will be the first sod and the last hole which you will be digging and it'll be the charged back to Lincolnshire at the end of the day who are happy to  on it.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you for that.<endOfText>
<human>Right, I think er, everyone's had a good say from both sides, and I would like to sum up and put it to the vote.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, really its a question of, do we borrow or don't we borrow.<endOfText>
<human>That's what we've been asked this morning.<endOfText>
<bot>It's also being raised by other conservatives, they wouldn't have started from here.<endOfText>
<human>And the question I've been asking myself of this, is that erm, where did we start from.<endOfText>
<bot>When we took control we inherited an unsustainable capital programme.<endOfText>
<human>Now that capital programme was at erm, fifty two million, I think it was thereabouts.<endOfText>
<bot>Which would be formulated in the pre-election year which was for obvious reasons.<endOfText>
<human>Would you allow me, please.<endOfText>
<bot>You know, I've allowed you all to speak, and I do expect the courtesy of <endOfText>
<human>I'm I'm sorry Councillor Wyle, I expect the courtesy towards the Chair, and I am now summing up, so please be quiet.<endOfText>
<bot>What did we inherit, I say we inherited that, and also we have inherited er an S S A to us, that you would have inherited, the conservative, at some ten million short of what we needed.<endOfText>
<human>Now I want to refer to that, because this is fact.<endOfText>
<bot>The increase in the education S S A nationally, by one point eight per cent.<endOfText>
<human>Lincolnshire only receive nought point five per cent increase.<endOfText>
<bot>That was a loss to Lincolnshire County Council, fact, of one point eight million.<endOfText>
<human>The area cost adjustment which the er government takes out of the total S S A's of some two hundred million has gone to the south-east, I hope none goes to Westminster, and that has cost us one point three million.<endOfText>
<bot>In the distribution of care in the community, the money for that, with the<endOfText>
<human>S S A. Reduction compared with the amount we received in ninety-three, ninety-four through the special transitional grant, we got a reduction there, two point two million.<endOfText>
<bot>This fact.<endOfText>
<human>It's been mentioned, I think it was Councillor  mentioned about the, he was pleased to see that we got two million pound in interest receipts against the eight hundred thousand that was envisaged.<endOfText>
<bot>But within the S S A, the government expected us to have three point  nine million  receipts.<endOfText>
<human>That is a loss of two million.<endOfText>
<bot>Also we've been arguing our claim for the sparsity factor, in other words, the national reduction of one hundred and sixty one million in ninety-four, ninety-five compared to ninety-three, ninety-four for the sparsity factor.<endOfText>
<human>One point six million.<endOfText>
<bot>Now whether you like it or not, and you're not in our position, because we er prepared to manage this authority, you would have had that same reduction to find, and I did hear Councillor  and he was also referring to capital spend the other day, saying he could have found ten million.<endOfText>
<human>I've also heard Councillor  er being, er er quoted in the press, as saying that he could find the money for capital schemes.<endOfText>
<bot>I think one was out at Caister.<endOfText>
<human>So that where we're at at this point in time.<endOfText>
<bot>Now Councillor  refers to whether the time was right, and why should we have to borrow.<endOfText>
<human>Well as you're aware, our philosophy, our policies are to protect and improve services, and a lot of our services, when we came in with our initiative, we started from a nil base, on some of the provision, and we are not prepared to stand by and see diminution of any of the services, if it is humanly possible.<endOfText>
<bot>So the decision is whether we borrow to protect those services, that's to the elderly, to the school children, to education and to try and enhance our road system.<endOfText>
<human>Er, then this is a decision we have, we want flexibility.<endOfText>
<bot>The interest rates are low at the present time.<endOfText>
<human>The climate is right, and we believe it could be sound financial management in a very difficult situation, it's been referred to, should we borrow.<endOfText>
<bot>The majority of the County Council's in this country borrow money.<endOfText>
<human>Er, I think it was Councillor  who referred to er looking at your own household budget.<endOfText>
<bot>I look at my er occasionally, I borrowed money over my lifetime, and managed to acquire a capital receipt, a property.<endOfText>
<human>And most of us do that, and that is the situation that we're in at the present time.<endOfText>
<bot>And, we're not in doing, not intend telling you at the er, proposals we will put in the budget, but I can give you an assurance at this point in time, that we shall be borrowing money.<endOfText>
<human>And the er, detail of that will come out when the proposals are put to the Policy and Resources Committee.<endOfText>
<bot>So I support er the recommendation for the change in the er, Treasury Management Policy er statement, and I formally move this to be adopted by this Committee.<endOfText>
<human>I second that.<endOfText>
<bot>I second that.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Seconded.<endOfText>
<human>All those in favour of that, please show  thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>One at the back there, would you count, please.<endOfText>
<human>Eight, Chair<endOfText>
<bot>And against.<endOfText>
<human>Six.<endOfText>
<bot>Seven.<endOfText>
<human>Would would you please register that the er, conservatives vote against it.<endOfText>
<bot>Do do all the conservatives agree with that statement.<endOfText>
<human>Agree.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, that is carried.<endOfText>
<human>didn't have to answer the questions  <endOfText>
<bot>I'm sorry, I'm moving on to the next paper.<endOfText>
<human>questions  <endOfText>
<bot>I'm sorry, that paper is finished with.<endOfText>
<human>We're moving on to the next paper.<endOfText>
<bot>The next er, paper.<endOfText>
<human>I have to move that under section one hundred A brackets four, the Local Government Act nineteen seventy-two.<endOfText>
<bot>The public be excluded from the meeting for the following items on the grounds that they involve the likely disclosure of exempt information as defined in paragraphs eight and one of part one of schedule four A of the  I so move  er, paper G, and I believe we've got,oh, I'm sorry, Morris .<endOfText>
<human>Thank you, Chair.<endOfText>
<bot>This paper that set out the  excuse me, the paper set out the details of the I T capital code   goes on to ninety-four, five.<endOfText>
<human>It's the result of a big process by individual departments, erm, it is set out on the basis of departments priorities.<endOfText>
<bot>It is shown in the priority all round the  department,.<endOfText>
<human>The paper's presented in two parts.<endOfText>
<bot>The first one is the standard format we use on the  getting the information through .<endOfText>
<human>The second part, I thought might be useful to members in explaining in more detail what each of the schemes were about.<endOfText>
<bot>The general customer paper is to build on the information structures that we've got, and to actually make the information more available internally and externally to the authority, and also to make use of new technology wherever that is possible.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, that's all I want to actually say in view of the .<endOfText>
<bot>You have this paper before us?<endOfText>
<human>Any questions or observations.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, yes, Mr Chairman.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, certainly it's a most interesting paper and er, certainly I think in the County we're doing very much er,think ever possible.<endOfText>
<bot>Er,a knowledge  but erm, I would have to move that we cannot accept this recommendation because, it's not that we don't er support the scheme within this  paper, but it's  that we cannot accept.<endOfText>
<human>And maybe you want to know what<endOfText>
<bot>and what would happen to the programme  it would be wrong at this point in time, to accept the paper before one knows what the  is of the County Council  as a whole will be.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, no.<endOfText>
<bot>Your moving, and so that's a direct negative.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>Any other comments?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll put it to the vote.<endOfText>
<human>Do you agree with the recommendations on the paper?<endOfText>
<bot>Chair.<endOfText>
<human>Against.<endOfText>
<bot>Six, Chair.<endOfText>
<human>Good.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you.<endOfText>
<human>That is er, carried.<endOfText>
<bot>Paper H.<endOfText>
<human>Mike <endOfText>
<bot>where's Mike, oh you're there, Mike.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you, Chair.<endOfText>
<human>This paper is er, a follow-up to a earlier paper that was presented to this committee back in October ninety-two.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, that paper reported on mortgage loans to employees, including two types of loan whereby the interest is not charged to an officer.<endOfText>
<human>Firstly the sole  bridging loans where the council relocates an employee within the county because admin reorganisation.<endOfText>
<bot>And secondly a temporary bridging loans for recruitment purposes, where an employee moves from another area to accept a post.<endOfText>
<human><endOfText>
<bot>Some years ago now, I left teaching, erm, and joined Abbey.<endOfText>
<human>I went on an induction course down in Bournemouth, which was all technical, er, I came back to see my first clients, and I cringed at the thought of it.<endOfText>
<bot>Can you imagine, you know a teacher, I thought I had to tell them every minute detail of these plans.<endOfText>
<human>All that business about allocation of units, I'm sitting them this.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, I still now, cringe at the thought of it.<endOfText>
<human>Because that isn't what the clients want to know.<endOfText>
<bot>They want to know that you know it, and they want to feel confident that if they ask you question you can answer it, but they very much want to know what it does for them and how much it's going to cost them basically.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, perhaps the easiest way to talk about it is, it's a fact that one point three million, quarter inch drill bits are sold in the U K.<endOfText>
<bot>In fact they were sold last year in the U K.<endOfText>
<human>Now, one three quarter inch drill bits.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean can you imagine people stopping their friends outside the D I Y store and saying you must buy one of these bits, it's absolutely superb, look at the metal, look at the shape, it's absolutely wonderful.<endOfText>
<human>They haven't been bought for what they are have they?<endOfText>
<bot>They've been bought for what they do.<endOfText>
<human>They've been bought for the fact that all over the country there's all these holes in the wall and people are putting up shelves, building furniture or whatever.<endOfText>
<bot>So it's very much what it does, and not what it is.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, another way of er, er, talking about it.<endOfText>
<bot>You're going to a friend's for a barbecue on a hot summer's evening, and you're walking up the drive and you can smell the barbecue sizzling away.<endOfText>
<human>Er, er, and your mouth starts to water, and you're thinking, this is going to be great.<endOfText>
<bot>You get to the barbecue, and amongst other things they're barbecuing sausages, and you think super.<endOfText>
<human>Well if they actually took the time to explain to you what went into those sausages, you probably wouldn't eat them at all, would you?<endOfText>
<bot>But, because of the smell and the taste and everything, you're quite happy to er, eat the sausages.<endOfText>
<human>You go for the sizzle, not the sausage.<endOfText>
<bot>So that's what we're going to be talking about now.<endOfText>
<human>Turning features into benefits.<endOfText>
<bot>We'll think you'll agree, after we've been through the Covermaster Plan, it's choc-a-bloc full of features, waiver of premium, escalating premium, insurability option, life cover, selective periods, bonuses, you name it, there's hundreds of features of the plan.<endOfText>
<human>We're going to look at how we can talk about them as benefits to the client.<endOfText>
<bot>There's two ways of doing it.<endOfText>
<human>Er, the first, the most straightforward way is to name the feature , if you want to briefly describe it if it's appropriate, and I mean briefly,then use a link phrase like what this means to you  and come out with a benefits statement, something that the client can relate to, and the final piece in the jigsaw is to ask the client how he feels about it.<endOfText>
<bot>What does he think?<endOfText>
<human>How do you feel?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, let's take waiver of premium, and go through that process.<endOfText>
<human>Andrew, is there a feature in this plan called waiver of premium, what these means to you is that if you're off ill for a long period of time, through accident, ill-health, whatever, Abbey will actually still pay them for you, until you're well again.<endOfText>
<bot>How do you feel about that?<endOfText>
<human>It sounds good.<endOfText>
<bot>It sounds great.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, nice and simple.<endOfText>
<bot>Don't go into all the technical details without er, six months er, payable until you return to work, reach sixty or die, payable for by reduced allocation to the units according the age and sex, etcetera, etcetera, and tell him what it does for him.<endOfText>
<human>In the Covermaster Plan, Andrew, there's something called waiver of premium, what this means to you is that if you're off work through illness for a long period of time, Abbey's going to pay the premiums for you.<endOfText>
<bot>How do you feel about that?<endOfText>
<human>Great, I'll have that, I'll have two in fact, yes?<endOfText>
<bot>Keep it short, keep it simple.<endOfText>
<human>, keep it simple.<endOfText>
<bot>It's stupid , but having said, yes, remember that.<endOfText>
<human>Now there's another way of doing it, which done well is more powerful.<endOfText>
<bot>But you have to think about it and it comes with practice, which as you obviously sell more and more of these plans, most of which have got waiver of premium.<endOfText>
<human>First of all what you do is disturb the client, or put another way, you create a problem,and then you solve it, with a feature,and then you ask, what do you think, how do you feel?<endOfText>
<bot>. If I take the same example, waiver of premium, erm, and I'm relating to knowledge that I will have got through the plan your future document, if I use Andrew again if I may, if I say to you, Andrew, erm, you explained earlier that erm, if you're off work through ill-health, your employer will actually pay you for six months, and then it stops.<endOfText>
<human>That's true isn't it, yes?<endOfText>
<bot>Can you see that maybe, if at some time in the future, you do have er, some bad health, or perhaps get involved in an accident, that after a period of time, it might be difficult to actually find the money to pay for this plan we're establishing tonight?<endOfText>
<human>yes<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, well the good news is, that there's actually something called waiver of premium on the plan, which looks after exactly the, looks after exactly that case.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>If you're off work for a long time, Abbey's going to pay the premiums for you, until you get well again.<endOfText>
<human>How do you like the idea of that?<endOfText>
<bot>It all sounds fine.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, you disturb him.<endOfText>
<bot>Some people will actually say, if I could add something to the plan that would cost you just a little bit more, which means that if you're off work through illness, the company, Abbey will pay the premiums for you, would you be prepared to pay a bit more.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Most people would say yes, actually, if you put that way.<endOfText>
<human>But what do you say, well the good news is, it's not going to cost you any more.<endOfText>
<bot>It's automatically included.<endOfText>
<human>So you can do that as well.<endOfText>
<bot>But, if you do it that way, it's often more powerful, because you're relating to the client's circumstances.<endOfText>
<human>Either way, keep it simple and get the client to tell you what he thinks.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you happy with, with the idea and the way I put it across, yes?<endOfText>
<human>Speak to me.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm, yes,<endOfText>
<human>Yes, good, because you're going to have a go at it.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>You might have known that was coming, mightn't you?<endOfText>
<bot>What I want you to do is shout out as many features of the plan as you can think of, and then in a minute we'll look at changing them into benefits.<endOfText>
<human>So, off you go.<endOfText>
<bot>Escalating premiums.<endOfText>
<human>Escalating premiums, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Unit linked.<endOfText>
<human>Unit linking.<endOfText>
<bot>Whole of life<endOfText>
<human>Whole of life,<endOfText>
<bot>Erm,<endOfText>
<human>Come on, we've been through all this<endOfText>
<bot>Terminal illness.<endOfText>
<human>Terminal illness benefit, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Waiver of premium.<endOfText>
<human>Waiver of premium.<endOfText>
<bot>Death benefit.<endOfText>
<human>Death benefit, or, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Paid up<endOfText>
<human>Sorry.<endOfText>
<bot>Paid up<endOfText>
<human>Paid up option.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Insurability<endOfText>
<bot>Insurability.<endOfText>
<human>Flexibility<endOfText>
<bot>Flexibility, yes, you can change  levels of cover, selected periods.<endOfText>
<human>Possible option of surrender value at the end of<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, surrender value,and partial surrenders, yes?<endOfText>
<human>I think we've probably got enough now, how many have we got?<endOfText>
<bot>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, right.<endOfText>
<human>I'm going to ask you as an individual to choose one.<endOfText>
<bot>And just to put together a way that you can change it from a feature into a benefit, using either of those ways.<endOfText>
<human>Or you can just give yourself some bullet points because you don't need to write out the and's and the the's and whatever.<endOfText>
<bot>But we'll ask you to select which one you're going to go for, and as I know we've got a room full of gentlemen, let's start with the ladies first.<endOfText>
<human>Kim, what would you like?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, waiver of premiums,<endOfText>
<human>Waiver of premiums, crafty.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, Shirley?<endOfText>
<human>Flexibility<endOfText>
<bot>Flexibility, oh that was the one you gave me, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Er, Janet?<endOfText>
<bot>Unit linking.<endOfText>
<human>Unit linking.<endOfText>
<bot>Sue?<endOfText>
<human>Selected period,<endOfText>
<bot>Selected period, right, Andrew?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, surrender value.<endOfText>
<bot>Surrender value, David?<endOfText>
<human>Whole of life.<endOfText>
<bot>Gerald?<endOfText>
<human>I'll take death benefits.<endOfText>
<bot>Death benefits, Philip?<endOfText>
<human>Escalating premium<endOfText>
<bot>Escalating premium, Ilias<endOfText>
<human>Partial surrender<endOfText>
<bot>Partial surrender, John.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, terrific,<endOfText>
<bot>I haven't written that have we?<endOfText>
<human>Terminal illness.<endOfText>
<bot>Terminal illness.<endOfText>
<human>Right, everybody clear on what you're going to do?<endOfText>
<bot>Spend a, a minute or so, putting your thoughts together, you can write it out if you want to, or you can just give you bullet points, what you've chosen you're going to change into a feature.<endOfText>
<human>If you start to go on to the other p , side of the page, start again.<endOfText>
<bot>Keep it simple, yes?<endOfText>
<human>And try and personalise it, I don't mind if you refer to any information that you might have gathered during the evening, a bit like I did with Andrew.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, but assuming that those people were being paid at work for six months, and then there was a problem.<endOfText>
<human>You can give them children, you can give them anything you like to try and personalise it, but keep it simple.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, are we ready?<endOfText>
<human>No, not yet.<endOfText>
<bot>No, no, we don't want any essays.<endOfText>
<human>Keep it simple  <endOfText>
<bot>You're not giving him time off again, are you?<endOfText>
<human>You know, I mean, all this freedom?<endOfText>
<bot>As you're finishing off, let me explain what we're going to do.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, I'm going to ask, first of all, for a volunteer.<endOfText>
<bot>Since you're all going to have a go, you can  who'd like to volunteer, so who would like to volunteer.<endOfText>
<human>Who's going to volunteer, Gerald's volunteered.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, we've got two here.<endOfText>
<human>Gerald will start, er, and he will talk to you as if you were a potential client, but so he can actually relate it to somebody, he'll choose one of you.<endOfText>
<bot>One of your colleagues, anybody in the room, and if you, when you are the potential client, when you talk to Gerald or whoever's talking to you, er, as if you're a potential client, relate to everything he says.<endOfText>
<human>If he says you've got six children and you work at the local factory, you do, yes?<endOfText>
<bot>You respond in kind.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, and he'll finish it off by asking you what you think about it, and obviously you respond to that.<endOfText>
<bot>So Gerald who're you going to start, have as client.<endOfText>
<human>I'll have John.<endOfText>
<bot>John, right, off you go then.<endOfText>
<human>So Gerald to John, what are we talking about?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, death benefit.<endOfText>
<human>Death benefit, right.<endOfText>
<bot>O K then, O K then John, er, looking at your erm, at your fact file, we see here that we've actually got erm, twice the amount of your salary erm, for life cover, which your company which your company actually offers, offers you.<endOfText>
<human>O K?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>O K, so at the moment, you've got two times your salary erm, life cover.<endOfText>
<bot>Let me ask you John, how would you actually feel if you were made redundant tomorrow?<endOfText>
<human>How would your family actually er, benefit?<endOfText>
<bot>Well because I've only got the life cover, then er, that cover would disappear.<endOfText>
<human>O K<endOfText>
<bot>Er, and I'd have to start thinking about where I am again.<endOfText>
<human>How do you actually feel about that?<endOfText>
<bot>Not too happy.<endOfText>
<human>Not too happy.<endOfText>
<bot>O K, if I could actually show you a way where there's not such a problem today, how would you feel then?<endOfText>
<human>It depends how much it cost.<endOfText>
<bot>O K, that's great, yes?<endOfText>
<human>Related to him, worried him, and offered him a solution, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Good, so John it must be your turn now, so you can select anybody else in the room, and go through the same process.<endOfText>
<human>Alright, erm, Janet.<endOfText>
<bot>What, what are you talking about John?<endOfText>
<human>Oh, erm, terminal illness.<endOfText>
<bot>Terminal illness, right.<endOfText>
<human>Janet, erm, obviously we'd examine your circumstances from time to time, erm, but er, there are obviously perhaps areas that concern you.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, if you were diagnosed as having cancer, and was intending to be dead in nine months, what would your reaction be to that?<endOfText>
<human>How can I put that, keep me, how can I look after myself as I obviously won't be able to work, and look for ways about er, getting my house in order before I er, finally die.<endOfText>
<bot>Well yes, of course you would, that's obviously quite a worry.<endOfText>
<human>Mm, it is, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Quite a concern.<endOfText>
<human>Well, how would you feel if I was to tell you that within the policy it was possible that the sum could be paid, it might even be paid up before death.<endOfText>
<bot>yes, like what?<endOfText>
<human>What's the test?<endOfText>
<bot>Well if you had er, your illness and so on, and the other debts that you may have, erm, and bearing in mind that you actually only have the nine months, you might be a little bit more er,a bit luckier than that, but how about a holiday in Disneyland?<endOfText>
<human>Gosh, that's like going to hell isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Well would that, that, that's what, would that be of interest to you?<endOfText>
<human>No, but there's plenty of things I would like to do, people I'd like to see, yes, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>There's certainly things a bit of extra money would make enjoyable in the last few months.<endOfText>
<human>Right well, I think I can show you a way on how to go about that.<endOfText>
<bot>How much more would it cost?<endOfText>
<human>Ah, well that depends on how much you want to spend.<endOfText>
<bot>No, it's not going to cost her any more, because it's included in the plan, so it's not going to include, so it's not going to cost her any more <endOfText>
<human>No it doesn't <endOfText>
<bot>Good, well done.<endOfText>
<human>Well personalised.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, er, very good effort.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, is it, would it, it showed you not to put words in her mouth, but I mean, it was nice to talk about Disneyland.<endOfText>
<bot>It brought a lovely humour to the situation, erm, but maybe to ask her what she'd likely to do, like to do in those er, last er, nine months or so.<endOfText>
<human>Good.<endOfText>
<bot>Well done, John.<endOfText>
<human>Janet?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, I wish I hadn't chosen this particular one.<endOfText>
<human>Can I ask, address another table,<endOfText>
<bot>N , yes, anybody, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Right, David I'll talk to you.<endOfText>
<bot>About?<endOfText>
<human>About?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, unit linking.<endOfText>
<human>Unit linking.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Right, David, you said you'd been approached by another insurance company, er, I could obviously say, I recommended Abbey Life, and I'm tied to that, but I actually joined because I think they're a particularly good company, in that what, in the use they make of the money that I'm  paying, actually goes, performs very well.<endOfText>
<bot>And I'll explain this a bit more.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, we, when we first came into the industry, erm, we brought in a totally new policy that the funds to provide the pensions and action, we put into unit trusts.<endOfText>
<bot>You know, do you know anything about unit trusts?<endOfText>
<human>Not really, no<endOfText>
<bot>Well it goes into a pot, and it, it buys into different funds which are invested in different markets, erm, to give you some examples, erm, we can invest in property, we can invest in some securities, government securities, er, we invest in the Stock Exchange and we have managers who look after these funds, and they perform extremely well.<endOfText>
<human>And if you go and have a look at the tables, you find that Abbey Life actually makes your money grow faster than a lot of other insurance companies.<endOfText>
<bot>And the benefits of this is that er, as you know, erm, inflation takes over, and we measure our spending power against that, five pounds in your pocket today, won't buy what tomorrow, what it bought this year, and next year, what it would have bought this year.<endOfText>
<human>So we have to keep ahead of that, because we're planning the benefits for you, twenty or twenty five years' time.<endOfText>
<bot>So we have to make sure the money you pay to us, actually is going to grow so it gives you a very good return on that money in twenty five years' time.<endOfText>
<human>So we put it into this pot and we invest it in as many funds and spread the money out, so if, if one fund doesn't produce very much in return, another fund will, and so we in fact, get a better spread throughout the market, than you could do as an individual.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean you could go out, and you could put a little bit of money in the building society, or the bank, or you could have a gamble on the Stock Exchange, but we have two advantages.<endOfText>
<human>We have erm, managers of these funds who have a lot of expertise, a lot of experience, we've been going over thirty years now, and we've grown extremely quickly because of the expertise of our managers.<endOfText>
<bot>We give our expertise for nothing really.<endOfText>
<human>It doesn't cost you any more, you just throw them in for free.<endOfText>
<bot>And the other thing is you clearly get a good spread of the market, and we know that this method will produce erm, a return for you which will keep your spending power ahead of inflation.<endOfText>
<human>Is there anything you'd like to ask me?<endOfText>
<bot>Can you please go through it again for me.<endOfText>
<human>I must have had a death wish choosing that.<endOfText>
<bot>Janet that was a lovely, clear description.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, but, how could you have improved it?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I would have liked him to participate more, but I didn't know how to lead him.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, yes, you needed to involve him, erm,<endOfText>
<bot>yes, that's my trouble.<endOfText>
<human>But, erm,, it was too long wasn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>It was too long, and you didn't involve the client.<endOfText>
<human>But I've, I've honestly got to say on your behalf, it was a lovely clear description of what happens as well, and there were some nice positive statements about Abbey er, and er, why unit linking is worked for Abbey, etcetera, so lots of it was absolutely great, but<endOfText>
<bot>You've got to count your words when you're playing the recorder.<endOfText>
<human>One thing I would say, it's very difficult to put over, is to get over,of the part you've paid back <endOfText>
<bot>it is, it is You've just, you've just got to ask, ask his opinion, is it important to you that you get a return on the money that you invest with us, yes?<endOfText>
<human>Or do you feel comfortable making decisions about where you're investing your money, or would you be happy for somebody else to do it?<endOfText>
<bot>Either way you could offer him <endOfText>
<human>Yes, I see, yes  er, I said, I could have said if you had been given a hundred thousand pounds how, or fifty thousand pounds how would you invest it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, if, if, if you can involve him more, but obviously this is a very nerve-racking situation, and er, the description was great, please <endOfText>
<human>, yes, the description was a death wish thinking that was <endOfText>
<bot>Right, Philip<endOfText>
<human>Escalating premium.<endOfText>
<bot>Escalating premiums, talking to?<endOfText>
<human>I think David, because he didn't answer Janet.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Right, O K, here goes.<endOfText>
<bot>David, just looking at your situation, I know you're er, a young chap and you have a young family, and we've er, discussing your existing circumstances and I can see that at the moment er, funds in the family budget are a little bit tight.<endOfText>
<human>If I could show you a way of keeping your premiums at an affordable level but still obtaining the li , the level of life cover that you need to be of  to your wife and your family, would, would that be of interest to you?<endOfText>
<bot>Well it's er, if it's cheaper then yes.<endOfText>
<human>Right, O K, well we have er, a feature in the er, in this particular policy which is er, full estimated <endOfText>
<bot>Stop, stop , you've done it, just leave it<endOfText>
<human>You know, quite a useful<endOfText>
<bot>No, no, no, just leave it.<endOfText>
<human>You did it very well, you're in danger of talking yourself out of it.<endOfText>
<bot>You needed to stop there because he did it very well, didn't he?<endOfText>
<human>He personalised it, he told him exactly the benefit of escalating premiums, and he couldn't say anything other than yes, because it was what he wanted.<endOfText>
<bot>But that was very good.<endOfText>
<human>Very good.<endOfText>
<bot>That's the hardest part.<endOfText>
<human>Right, David?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I'll go over the other side, Andrew.<endOfText>
<human>Andrew, right .<endOfText>
<bot>Presumably.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, Andrew, er, I, I find that earlier on the, the only life cover you've really got is one that you took out a few years ago, a very small one, and you took that out for a set number of years.<endOfText>
<bot>So you took that out when you were twenty, and I believe it's er, finishing when you're fifty.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, that's right.<endOfText>
<bot>So you've got, after that you've got nothing.<endOfText>
<human>There's nothing coming after<endOfText>
<bot>Nothing at all <endOfText>
<human>How do you feel about that?<endOfText>
<bot>About all that, all those premiums you've paid and you're fifty one, and all of a sudden you've got nothing at the end of it?<endOfText>
<human>I can't say I've ever worried about it, I just thought I'd look at it when I got there.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm, so what if could erm, could come up with a policy, that you pay your premiums in, but it covers you for the whole of your life.<endOfText>
<human>So that no matter when you die, whether you're a hundred and twenty or whatever, you can get the sum that you've assured, well that won't help you, but your dependents will.<endOfText>
<bot>Would that be of interest to you?<endOfText>
<human>It would yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, good.<endOfText>
<human>Er, one good example, as cited er, er, a term policy, if you couldn't cite one that he had himself, you could cite examples so that people know about it.<endOfText>
<bot>A little bit of a tendency to talk too much about it though.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, keep it bit shorter and simpler, but, just the right way of going about it to illustrate the point.<endOfText>
<bot>How would you feel if you'd been paying this money for ten years and then you lived, you lived after than, and you got nothing for it basically.<endOfText>
<human>We're talking the whole of life.<endOfText>
<bot>Good.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, Andrew?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, I'll look at Ilias.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, erm, as you've heard, this policy is basically for your protection, but it does over a number of years, acquire a bit of savings.<endOfText>
<human>Obviously,th , there is four or five years there's nothing to speak of, but after that it does acquire more.<endOfText>
<bot>So like yourself, you've got a daughter, who perhaps fifteen, twenty years' time, will be getting married, at which point the policy could be surrendered to put towards the cost of the wedding.<endOfText>
<human>Or when you retire, it could be used as a lump sum to set yourself up initially for your retirement, so how would you feel about that?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, I would be in trouble.<endOfText>
<human>you'd have more savings.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, yes, good.<endOfText>
<human>Good, because you set it out, as as, er, you gave a scenario where the money would be useful to the fu , the future, so that was, that was good.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, you could have got to the close a little bit earlier, but then it, I think you were just finding your words, that was good, well done.<endOfText>
<human>You related it directly to Ilias.<endOfText>
<bot>Ilias, who're you going to talk to?<endOfText>
<human>No it's got to be somebody who hasn't had a go, otherwise the system falls down, doesn't it.<endOfText>
<bot>Shirley, Kim, somebody close?<endOfText>
<human>Shirley, if sometime in your life er, you need money er, for example, er, you're in when you're a start of marriage, and you have mortgage, how will you go to ?<endOfText>
<bot>Er, with difficulty.<endOfText>
<human>Well in er, this policy any time if you want to surrender so if you need er, some of the money, you can get that money or  any time.<endOfText>
<bot>Will it affect my life cover then?<endOfText>
<human>yes.<endOfText>
<bot>O K, that, that was, that was a good er, it was a good setting the scene, because you related it to Shirley.<endOfText>
<human>Shirley came up with a stat , with a question, which is a very important question, will if affect my life cover?<endOfText>
<bot>Obviously it depends how much you take out.<endOfText>
<human>But if you start talking about taking some of the cash from the fund, you've got to tell the clients it could affect the cover that they've got, because it isn't a savings policy.<endOfText>
<bot>But it's a bonus isn't it, because they've had all this protection on this  and they've still got some cash building up.<endOfText>
<human>O K, good.<endOfText>
<bot>Shirley?<endOfText>
<human>I'll go with .<endOfText>
<bot>Right so if we pay you by five yearly  value in three months, and invest for initially life cover of twenty thousand, and that's O K for now.<endOfText>
<human>And we take you three years along the line, so your husband dies, and you've now got a young child.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you think twenty thousand is going to be adequate.<endOfText>
<human>No it probably wouldn't be.<endOfText>
<bot>Well this policy is actually flexible, you can actually if you do have children, you can then increase the life cover.<endOfText>
<human>That's exactly what we want.<endOfText>
<bot>Well done Sue, you actually stopped her finishing it.<endOfText>
<human>Oh<endOfText>
<bot>You did it, you did it very well, yes, but you needed, I know you were going to, you needed to say at the end, is this important to you, or is this something you would like on your policy.<endOfText>
<human>Good, well done, Shirley.<endOfText>
<bot>So Sue, it must be you, to<endOfText>
<human>Who's left?<endOfText>
<bot>Kim?<endOfText>
<human>Kim, I think, is it?<endOfText>
<bot>Right,Kim, erm, we talked, we talked earlier about life cover er, on death, on the death of your husband.<endOfText>
<human>You actually have three children under the age of seven, and if your husband died while they were still young, still in education, heaven forbid, but these things still do happen, it might be that you think that you would need more cover at that point in time, than later on, maybe when the children have left home.<endOfText>
<bot>Would it be fair to say that that's a good statement to make?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, it would be, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>How would you feel if you were able to designate more life cover for a selected period of your choice, er, and then, maybe alter, er, the cover later on, so that you can have higher cover at certain points in your life, to cover these critical things, like your children's education, while they're growing up erm, at any point in the future.<endOfText>
<human>That's it.<endOfText>
<bot>Good, well done Sue.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, yes, selected periods.<endOfText>
<bot>Well presented, well personalised, did they have to finish it?<endOfText>
<human>No<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, before you started repeating.<endOfText>
<human>It's very difficult to keep it simple, it really is.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, I know Gerald went first, and I know he's been in the business a long while, but he actually managed to say it all in about three sentences.<endOfText>
<human>That's experience, but that, that's what we're aiming to a , er, achieve.<endOfText>
<bot>Kim, last but not least, it's to Gerald,<endOfText>
<human>Hello  <endOfText>
<bot>That was nice and short and simple, well done.<endOfText>
<human>Do you want it or not?<endOfText>
<bot>That's it, that's it.<endOfText>
<human>Do I get a waiver of premiums with it?<endOfText>
<bot>Lovely<endOfText>
<human>You've put me completely off, now.<endOfText>
<bot>I knew I'd got kids written down here for a reason.<endOfText>
<human>Even started whether there's not two extra, but it costs more.<endOfText>
<bot>We were talking earlier, and I understand you liked to ride at the weekends, and you're often competing on your horse, er, ha, if you were to have a fall, and erm, you had a back injury, or erm, you sustained an injury that would you keep you from work for a substantial amount of time, er, how would you feel, would you be able to pay your premiums?<endOfText>
<human>Would it be a problem to you?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, not really, not to begin with, because I get erm, sick pay from work, I get that for six months.<endOfText>
<human>But if it's an on-going problem that, would possibly keep from work, let's say for a year.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, then it would be a problem.<endOfText>
<human>Right, well we, we have something which would actually solve that, erm, which would be of benefit to you, and would actually cut in at the six month period, and would continue paying your policy and your premiums, until your retirement age if necessary.<endOfText>
<bot>Would that be of interest to you?<endOfText>
<human>Oh, yes, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Good, well done, Kim.<endOfText>
<human>You weren't put off by all the bawdry earlier, well done.<endOfText>
<bot>In fact, well done everybody, because it sounds a simple thing to do.<endOfText>
<human>When we actually got down to it, it wasn't quite as simple was it, and I think every one of you were personalising it really well, and making an excellent start.<endOfText>
<bot>Good.<endOfText>
<human>That actually brings us to the end of the Covermaster product.<endOfText>
<bot>We've spent nearly all day, talking about something what you knew about.<endOfText>
<human>Well hopefully you've found it of benefit.<endOfText>
<bot>What we're now going to look at is living assurance.<endOfText>
<human>Now, so we can actually distinguish between the two policies, which are very similar in lots of ways, we're going to start again by looking at a video.<endOfText>
<bot>Now this video, erm, was compiled by Dr. Marius Bernard.<endOfText>
<human>Dr. Christian Bernard, the South African surgeon, heart surgeon, his brother.<endOfText>
<bot>He was talking at the Life Assurance Association er, convention in London I think it's er, three year ago now, in er, nineteen ninety, it must be ninety one, because I went on a course then.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, and he can tell you better than me, really the benefits of living assurance.<endOfText>
<bot>So I'd like you to, as you did this morning please, move your chairs all round, close the blinds, and er, it's the, the second video of the day.<endOfText>
<human>If you want to, it's going to last erm, about half an hour.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, fine.<endOfText>
<human>Have you heard of Dr. er?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes<endOfText>
<human>Oh, right, well.<endOfText>
<bot>Do I have to  things to talk about it,<endOfText>
<human>Yes, yes, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, by the way, you've got to work through this video.<endOfText>
<human>You know your workbooks that you've got, he's actually asking you a few questions relating to the statistics that er, Dr. Bernard's going to mention, so can I ask you to get your workbooks and a pen, just so that you can jot down some of the information.<endOfText>
<bot>You have to listen quite carefully.<endOfText>
<human>What do you mean workbooks?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean workbooks.<endOfText>
<human>Oh.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, these things.<endOfText>
<human>I thought those were for <endOfText>
<bot>Everyone found their's.<endOfText>
<human>No<endOfText>
<bot>They were given out yesterday, Philip.<endOfText>
<human>Were they?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, how silly of me.<endOfText>
<human>Again I didn't like to say that,<endOfText>
<bot>Has he been hassling you?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Page ten.<endOfText>
<human>Please welcome Dr. Marius Bernard.<endOfText>
<bot>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, er, looking at you and listening to you, it's certainly different to the operating rooms that one's used to working in.<endOfText>
<human>Er, don't feel a bit disappointed that during my presentation I'll be expecting to this hospital, I'll take you to the operating room, er  <endOfText>
<bot>Please ,<endOfText>
<human>Sorry <endOfText>
<bot>But certainly it's very real to what we're going to talk about today <endOfText>
<human>That's O K <endOfText>
<bot>I'd also like to say, Mr. Chairman, that er, I didn't recognise the hospital you said, where we did this operation,, erm, if you want to, see me afterwards, I'll tell you that you take  at the  hospital.<endOfText>
<human>But you've got to be an erudite  to be able to understand that.<endOfText>
<bot>Ladies and gentleman, I'm very honoured really indeed, it's a privilege to be part of being here today, as part of the insurance industry.<endOfText>
<human>I believe very gratefully, and very sincerely about a great tomorrow, and my profession is striving to bring that to the health of peoples and nations.<endOfText>
<bot>I've been very fortunate to be able to become part of your industry, to see part of your contribution to my patients for the great tomorrow.<endOfText>
<human>I'm not an insurance man, I'm a doctor.<endOfText>
<bot>I couldn't care about the insurance companies, although I love your  where I choose.<endOfText>
<human>I can care about my patients, and I sincerely hope that you will make it possible for my patients when their diagnosis is made, to have that knowledge that financially, he has a great tomorrow.<endOfText>
<bot>I believe that insurance is an honest attempt to provide financial security and independence when you need it most.<endOfText>
<human>And you really need it most when your health starts failing.<endOfText>
<bot>When the diagnosis of the illness is made, think around your clients and your relatives, because that opportunity to generate the financial security and the friends you need, is threatened by the guilt.<endOfText>
<human>Now where does the doctor come into this?<endOfText>
<bot>I want to go back the year, nineteen hundred, and let's hear the causes of death, because when many infectives caused by viruses and the bacteria, the life expectancy for a male was fifty, and for a women was fifty four.<endOfText>
<human>If I was born in that period, I would be dead already, and you wouldn't need to listen to me   But if you look at this as far as the medical profession and the insurance profession need each other, what happened to these people when they develop an infective condition?<endOfText>
<bot>Pneumonia for example.<endOfText>
<human>It was very easy, they either died, four or five days later, very cheaply it used to cost ten pounds to die.<endOfText>
<bot>It was a very cheap affair.<endOfText>
<human>Or they recovered, but what happened?<endOfText>
<bot>When they recovered, there was no destruction of the heart, lungs and they could go back and work, a young person, as if they'd never been ill.<endOfText>
<human>But if they died, there was a very young family, a young wife, needing financial independence that was given to them by you, with a life insurance policy.<endOfText>
<bot>Really it's a death insurance policy.<endOfText>
<human>That's what it is.<endOfText>
<bot>Now the medical profession responded to this state of affairs, and created antibiotics, I can assure you today, that if you die of pneumonia, you can sue your doctor, with the greatest of thought that you'll get paid.<endOfText>
<human>And they've developed vaccination and immunization, so the infective conditions are no longer causes of death.<endOfText>
<bot>You see now that the most common cause of death is what they call the  of diseases resulting from degenerate lifestyles, and I'm very proud   and I'm very proud to tell you that although I come from South Africa, and you might not think I'm very intelligent, as you sit here, down here and there, I can sign your death certificate already.<endOfText>
<human>Fifty percent of you will die of heart attacks, twenty plus will die of cancer, and ten percent will die of strokes.<endOfText>
<bot>And it's getting worse.<endOfText>
<human>Why does this happen.<endOfText>
<bot>Longer life expectancy.<endOfText>
<human>Your life expectancy as a male today is seventy four years, and for the females of the species, and we  love them, your life expectancy is eighty years.<endOfText>
<bot>Isn't it amazing?<endOfText>
<human>So what we doctors gave you, you developed this lifestyle.<endOfText>
<bot>You should thank your doctor.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you for curing my pneumonia and , now I'm going to abuse my body.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm going to smoke too much , I'm going to smoke too much, I'm going to drink too much, I'm not going to do enough exercise, I'm going to put on too much weight, I'm going to stress myself too much, and I can talk to you five days about those conditions.<endOfText>
<human>If you're going to  insurance, think then, just think with me back, have you seen that?<endOfText>
<bot>You remember this man?<endOfText>
<human>He thinks he's thin, for a Merry Christmas, test the health of your eggs.<endOfText>
<bot>You could just as well say the same for him, death in a box, but it is a, and now the next advert, with him now, the next advert is even better.<endOfText>
<human>More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette.<endOfText>
<bot>Can you just imagine me advertising that today.<endOfText>
<human>I would be shot before dawn.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, what's happened because of this debilitative lifestyle.<endOfText>
<human>It has developed two types of condition.<endOfText>
<bot>The wonderful arteriosclerosis, and the wonderful cancer.<endOfText>
<human>Who will get this arteriosclerosis, as you sit here, let me tell you again.<endOfText>
<bot>If you just born you're free, at the age of five, fifteen percent is attacked, at the age of eight, it's forty percent, and eight of you over forty, congratulations, you're all got arteriosclerosis.<endOfText>
<human>All of you.<endOfText>
<bot>Now what is arteriosclerosis?<endOfText>
<human>It's a deposit in the arteries of fat.<endOfText>
<bot>It looks the English breakfast fixing it up for, that's what  and if you, if you want to look at an X-ray, you will see that the arteries of the body, those are the arteries, bring the blood supply is blocked with arteriosclerosis, and there you can see the English breakfast, the yolk of egg, the butter and all these things that are in there, causing a blockage of the artery, not enough to that muscle, and a heart attack, death and all these unbelievable things, that give me a little bit of income.<endOfText>
<human>,. I had a very serious patient er, the other day, and I treated him and gave him six months to live, but at the end of six months, he didn't pay his account, so I gave him another six months.,.<endOfText>
<bot>Now God in his wisdom unfortunately, unfortunately blocked the most important arteries of the body.<endOfText>
<human>Not the arteries to your toenails or the tip of your nose, but the arteries to what we call the vital organs.<endOfText>
<bot>The coronary arteries, heart, heart attack.<endOfText>
<human>Carotid arteries, stroke.<endOfText>
<bot>Aorta, aortic surge, renal arteries, free kidney failure, these are what blocked arteries can do.<endOfText>
<human>Can you hear the dread disease conditions entry there.<endOfText>
<bot>Now what happens when your arteries get blocked? is that you get a pain in the chest, a piece of your heart dies, if you have a heart attack, or the whole heart dies off and you have death.<endOfText>
<human>One of the easiest diagnoses in my profession.<endOfText>
<bot>There are more than a hundred and fifty thousand heart attacks in your country every year.<endOfText>
<human>That's not true, don't you believe it.<endOfText>
<bot>It's more than three hundred th , three hundred thousand.<endOfText>
<human>That was the slide of approximately eight years ago.<endOfText>
<bot>It's a galloping form of death, due to modern lifestyles,.<endOfText>
<human>That's the brain, that's a stroke, the brain is a very sensitive part of the body, and as you know in this very topic of debate, if the brain don't get enough blood, er, for three minutes, you've got permanent brain damage and the only occupation that's suitable is that of a politician.<endOfText>
<bot>,. There are more than a hundred thousand stroke victims in your country every year.<endOfText>
<human>Kidney disease, ten thousand new, five thousan , ten thousand total, five hundred new cases.<endOfText>
<bot>That's a beautiful slide of carcinoma of the rectum, just to give the r , the carcinomas,, especially for you, carcinoma of the lung, as we say in Africaan's, weaker, that's nice.<endOfText>
<human>That's what you get from smoking.<endOfText>
<bot>There are more than two hundred and forty thousand people in the United States who die of cancer every year.<endOfText>
<human>And that's the quickest  hospital, because we've responded again in the medical profession.<endOfText>
<bot>Do what you have done, abusing your bodies.<endOfText>
<human>We said if you want to abuse your bodies, we're going to take every bloody pound you have in your pocket away with you, with the most modern medical treatment, bowels.<endOfText>
<bot>Heart-lung machines, that a machine that I can use, when you're put in a heart-lung machine, I stop this machine, I keep this machine going, and I take out your heart, and your, your heart, I drop it on the floor, pick it up, wash in Parmolive soap, and put it back again.<endOfText>
<human>All these things I can do, to prevent death.<endOfText>
<bot>Young babies, baby are there days of care, and look what we get.<endOfText>
<human>Isn't it amazing.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you going to be sure that that money is available to provide for this.<endOfText>
<human>Isn't that beautiful?<endOfText>
<bot>Isn't that the most beautiful photo you've ever seen in your life.<endOfText>
<human>No applause, no cheers, you know that's made to feel here.<endOfText>
<bot>This is, it's your heart, ladies and gentlemen, with a normal heart muscle.<endOfText>
<human>Now when you abuse your bodies, and you get the coronary artery disease, what happens?<endOfText>
<bot>That heart becomes looking like that.<endOfText>
<human>It looks like it's been on the M twenty five on a Friday night, and every tyre's been over it.<endOfText>
<bot>. Now that normal heart you saw, you saw that normal heart, I would ask you if it was in a twenty five four year old man, do you think that man is alive or dead?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, he's dead, he was killed in a motor car accident.<endOfText>
<bot>And the heart of that that's been on the M twenty five, is the patient alive or dead?<endOfText>
<human>Twenty two years later, and there he spends, with the , was our eight heart transplant patient.<endOfText>
<bot>Sam says before he had his heart attacks, he had five six, I'll have to change the story.<endOfText>
<human>Twenty two years later, and there he spends, with the  he was our eighth heart transplant patient.<endOfText>
<bot>Sam says before he had his heart attacks, he had five, six, I'll have to change the story, he has a heart transplant, he developed diabetes, and he's later amputated.<endOfText>
<human>Do you know when he comes down here, he complains about this.<endOfText>
<bot>It's like my  when he was eighty, they asked him how do you feel?<endOfText>
<human>If I think of the alternative, I feel bloody well.<endOfText>
<bot>,But, but it is very serious.<endOfText>
<human>He has one complaint every time he comes and sees us.<endOfText>
<bot>What's that?<endOfText>
<human>Money.<endOfText>
<bot>This operation and this threat to his health, has created a lack of possible to regenerate the money needed for him, and his financial independence has been threatened.<endOfText>
<human>You from the insurance industry, twenty five years after heart attacks, when he should have died, despite the modern medicine.<endOfText>
<bot>After twenty three years, after the heart transplant, eight years after osmosis , I want to give you his secret, guess what he's got.<endOfText>
<human>He's got a life insurance policy.<endOfText>
<bot>It's amazing.<endOfText>
<human>And that life insurance policy to him, is of no help.<endOfText>
<bot>He needed something new, because we in the medical profession, in responding to your new diseases, from the abuse of your body, have created the situation that you've got to insure yourself, that financially independence, not because you're going to die, but because you're going to live.<endOfText>
<human>And that is the way that we develop the concept of great living insurance.<endOfText>
<bot>Creating these insurance to die is the number one need for financial independence, because we as doctors are going to spread the news with our modern lifestyles, because unlike the pneumonia patient you're not going to recover and go back to work, unlike the, the heart transplant, as the heart transplant, or the heart attack or the cancer patient, maybe at our expense.<endOfText>
<human>Invest money.<endOfText>
<bot>Give you an example.<endOfText>
<human>If any of the you, I challenge to go to your bank manager tomorrow, and say to him, I've had a heart attack, I'm not going to pay my loan of a hundred thousand pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you know what happens?<endOfText>
<human>He'll get a heart attack, that's what happens.<endOfText>
<bot>. That's just the things we do, with the coronary arteries, we do coronary artery by- passes, I can, I can sew like any woman, I can darn your socks, we stick the veins on and we re-establish the the heart going a bit faster.<endOfText>
<human>Now, three hundred thousand men and women suffer heart attacks each year in your country, but many will survive.<endOfText>
<bot>Think about the word survive, before I tell you, what does that mean, survive?<endOfText>
<human>We as doctors say, we're so bloody wonderful, you know we're very important.<endOfText>
<bot>We're so wonderful, our patients survive.<endOfText>
<human>If he drops dead when he gets out of hospital, we no longer care about him, as long as he survived.<endOfText>
<bot>Who is going to survive.<endOfText>
<human>Seventy seven percent will survive five years, fifty eight percent survive ten years, and forty seven survive thirty years, and we are improving.<endOfText>
<bot>We are the miracle men have decided that you're not allowed to die.<endOfText>
<human>Let us promise you, you are not allowed to die any more, we are going to s , to improve our treatment, and you're going to survive, but with daily, increasing threat to that financial dependence that you've so keenly want, that you want for your loved ones.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you want see your ?<endOfText>
<human>Isn't that beautiful?<endOfText>
<bot>Have you seen anything like that?<endOfText>
<human>That's the lungs.<endOfText>
<bot>I wish I could talk longer because I'd like to tell you about the lungs, but er, time's still.<endOfText>
<human>A twenty four year old woman came to see me for treatment on the ward, a smoker.<endOfText>
<bot>I had to investigate her, and I diagnosed that she had cancer of the lungs.<endOfText>
<human>There's someone out already.<endOfText>
<bot>She came to see me a year later, total loss of weight, total short of breath, hardly , she's struggling to keep body and soul together.<endOfText>
<human>She says to me, I cannot continue, she's dead already, I will never forget her face, never.<endOfText>
<bot>Now what would have happened if her broker came to this convention and heard about their disease, and two years ago sold her a  disease policy, that would have given her two hundred thousand pounds, on the diagnosis of the disease.<endOfText>
<human>That little girl had to struggle on because the flat rent had to be paid, she had to struggle on because she had a car, kids had to go to school, until she died.<endOfText>
<bot>Now if she had two hundred thousand pounds, what would it have given her.<endOfText>
<human>She could have stopped working.<endOfText>
<bot>She could have spent quality time with her children.<endOfText>
<human>If it happens to me, I will say, I'll take that two hundred thousand, and go to Hollywood, and spend the night with Madonna, that would have been my choice.<endOfText>
<bot>It would have been Madonna's choice too by the way.<endOfText>
<human>,. Thirty percent of all people in your country, your  country, suffer from a condition called cancer, and ninety percent will be life threatening.<endOfText>
<bot>How long they survive, if you look at my age, I'm a male, thirty five,forty seven percent, forty percent will survive at least er, five years.<endOfText>
<human>If you look at the Chairman, here this afternoon, sixty four, twenty nine percent will survive.<endOfText>
<bot>But on the whole, of the diagnoses of cancers made today, more than fifty percent will survive more than five years.<endOfText>
<human>Have you ever seen a person with cancer of the lung, cancer of the stomach?<endOfText>
<bot>Have you seen what their survival means?<endOfText>
<human>It's a slow progression to unableness to perform their daily needs especially to start with the threat to the person, of opportunities to greater income.<endOfText>
<bot>Only crystal  will pay up on the diagnosis, and make it possible.<endOfText>
<human>Like Samuel  stated,in a woman suffered strokes, seventy eight percent will survive at least one, have you ever seen a person with a stroke?<endOfText>
<bot>Have you ever seen a person with a stroke?<endOfText>
<human>It's not only the patient, who lies there paralysed and unable to talk, and unable to move, it involves his whole family.<endOfText>
<bot>His whole family is locked into caring, working wives have to give up work to come and help them.<endOfText>
<human>There's a clue, there's a clue for the need of  insurance, not because you're going to die, but because you're going to live, and that is the reason why I'm prepared to cross this world.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't ask you to sell better , ladies and gentlemen, I don't ask you to sell itself for certain companies, I'd like you to, but I don't.<endOfText>
<human>What I ask you and I insist, that for a great tomorrow for my patients, you tell them about it.<endOfText>
<bot>Just tell them about this product, what it can do, and I assure you of the results.<endOfText>
<human>You never have to tell a person who's had a heart attack, you never need to tell a woman when her husband has a stroke, I have to.<endOfText>
<bot>Help me, give me that great tomorrow, by enough financial security.<endOfText>
<human>Look at what we've done to each other, er, to ourselves, in the young, in nineteen hundred, eight percent of people had heart attacks, six percent strokes, cancer, four percent, total eighteen percent.<endOfText>
<bot>And now, with the way that the human  take it to the medical profession for giving them a longer life expectancy, thirty percent of people are diseased.<endOfText>
<human>Twenty one cancer, and nine percent strokes.<endOfText>
<bot>It varies from cancer, in world statistics.<endOfText>
<human>You must watch our statistics.<endOfText>
<bot>In America, it's been shown that statistically, that men have got more children than women.<endOfText>
<human>So be very careful with statistics.<endOfText>
<bot>This is the figure of your country, I think are very significant, of the reduction of death rates of people, are getting higher and higher, and the time that's spent through illness off work, and there's an increase in survival after the diagnosis of the dread disease.<endOfText>
<human>Ladies and gentlemen, that's why I'm very proud.<endOfText>
<bot>I've been very lucky, I'm not being charitable, but I've a lot of luck.<endOfText>
<human>I've been lucky to be able to launch the first concept of dread disease insurance, in South Africa you might have heard about us.<endOfText>
<bot>It's called living assurance, launched August ninety eight, for Standard Life Assurance and Wallace .<endOfText>
<human>When we changed the concept of insurance totally, and we have said that the sum assured will be paid out on the diagnosis of the disease, and not on death or anything else.<endOfText>
<bot>We then created the first product which heart attacks, strokes, cancers and certain coronary artery disease, which I can see.<endOfText>
<human>I believe you can see why, first of it it's most common, and second to coronary artery disease, I'm a cardiac surgeon, I want my piece of the action too, so we keep  as well.<endOfText>
<bot>We have a lot of privacies, and a lot of things until we change them, and you know why we changed it, because you went out and saw your clients and told them products and they reported you, and you came back and said but what about this, what about this?<endOfText>
<human>And we responded to the need that you, and I don't think you will ever appreciate it, I cannot thank you enough for your input in this product of yours.<endOfText>
<bot>You made it what it is.<endOfText>
<human>Until we increase it by surgery for disease of aorta, renal failure, therapy for blindness, replacement of a heart valve and organ transplant.<endOfText>
<bot>And then the danger of lungs and  in which I do quite well, and you can say to us, and we earn it.<endOfText>
<human>Multiple sclerosis and any terminal illness.<endOfText>
<bot>Why any terminal illness?<endOfText>
<human>Just in case, somebody escape that net of dread diseases  The lucky ones.<endOfText>
<bot>If your doctors says that you're going die within twelve months, we will accept it as a diagnosis of a critical illness.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, we are getting through on that, are you going to suggest on it?<endOfText>
<bot>We are going to improve and produce what I believe the optimum product eventually.<endOfText>
<human>And you know it, it's amazing how since my involvement for the last two years in Great Britain, all the problems that you have with critical illness, all the problems.<endOfText>
<bot>All those things about definitions, standardisation and all that.<endOfText>
<human>Do you know what, they said it's not justified, tell that to the young farmer of thirty four with a dread disease, his policy when we pay him two hundred thousand pounds in his hospital bed.<endOfText>
<bot>Say to him it's not justified on his policy, I want the money back.<endOfText>
<human>It seems that it is not clarification of definition, tell that to the woman who looked for two, thirteen years after a stroke husband and they had to wait for his death, that you didn't sell him a dread disease policy because there is not clarification of definition.<endOfText>
<bot>Tell the young mother whose child has just received fifteen thousand pounds after the diagnosis of leukaemia, that you shouldn't have filled the policy because the contexts where not standardised.<endOfText>
<human>No ladies and gentlemen, dread disease insurance is a success because it's needed today and tomorrow, and it works.<endOfText>
<bot>What does it do? and then I'll finish and I'll summarise.<endOfText>
<human>If you want me to come back, I'll speak for another five hours.<endOfText>
<bot>What does it do?<endOfText>
<human>Think about it very careful, it attains to the threat of loss of own ability.<endOfText>
<bot>The person has his financial independence threatened by disease, is helped by the dread disease insurance.<endOfText>
<human>Compare it with life insurance, death insurance.<endOfText>
<bot>It accelerates the pay-out by one day, two days, ten days, thirty days, of the death plan, because it pays out on the condition, that's going to be the cause of the death, and not on the death.<endOfText>
<human>So it accelerates death.<endOfText>
<bot>So death insurance, dread disease insurance,, go to much, will do it far better, just quicker.<endOfText>
<human>That's all we can do.<endOfText>
<bot>Inability to work, permanent disability, it accelerates permanent disability because ninety five percent of the conditions that cause the disability will pay out years before you have a disability.<endOfText>
<human>I am would claim now for a man who has a disability claim.<endOfText>
<bot>His accountant said that my stroke is weakening his left arm, he's right-handed.<endOfText>
<human>He can speak with a bit of slurring, so what.<endOfText>
<bot>He says he's got loss of memory, without a stroke, I have that as well, so that makes no difference.<endOfText>
<human>He comes and he wants disability.<endOfText>
<bot>He is not disabled, and yet he makes like he never would have the diagnosis of disability recognised.<endOfText>
<human>But dread disease insurance recognised his condition long before disability, and finally what does the dread disease insurance do.<endOfText>
<bot>It does something even more wonderful, it accelerates critical illness diagnosis by paying out on the disabling condition like loss of limb, where it creates a situation where the permanent person get paid out even before he has a critical condition, because that condition threatens his chances of paying his daily needs due to financial independence.<endOfText>
<human>And to continue ladies and gentlemen, I don't think you know where I come from, I've got illiterate  parents, you might say that you can see that.<endOfText>
<bot>My father was a missionary had come from a dusty little town in South Africa, I've got many wonderful experiences in my life, I've had experience of heart transplant.<endOfText>
<human>I've the experience of being in a political party that says one man, one vote, release Mandela, and all these things that we were nearly shot for.<endOfText>
<bot>Today they let prisoners of South Africa say it, it's amazing.<endOfText>
<human>But I was also involved in an insurance policy that has been made available for my patients, when they have that worst moment in their lives, you've got cancer, you've had a stroke, to know that in this threat, to what's going to happen to them, they at least have financial independence.<endOfText>
<bot>I believe that creates the great tomorrow.<endOfText>
<human>Life is not only quantity, it's quality as well.<endOfText>
<bot>You have that choice, that chance to do that for my patients and I tell you, to be with you, to be part of you, I'm as a , I learn for you, I think of you, and I can just tell you, I wish you all the best, but I won't forget your responsibility to help the medical profession to make, with the work they do for a better tomorrow possible, due to your work, your hard attempts to give that financial ability through the best insurance policies on the market today.<endOfText>
<human>God bless you, everything of the best, thank you very much.<endOfText>
<bot>Would you like to take a five minute stretch whilst  before we continue.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot><endOfText>
<human>You were saying that th the, the trainers pay for all these horse walks and maintain them?<endOfText>
<bot>Your <endOfText>
<human>Erm  What do they <endOfText>
<bot>heath fees, there's heath fees, and there's all, all you have to pay for the heath fees and all, you know.<endOfText>
<human>Hmm<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Was that for training?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Training was very very dear today, I dunno what it is now  it was very very dear  to train 'em.<endOfText>
<bot>To own an animal you wanna be a millionaire you see.<endOfText>
<human>Well, you want a lot of money, don't ya?<endOfText>
<bot>To do it well.<endOfText>
<human>Well, you know what it is buying one yourself.<endOfText>
<bot>You gotta feed it properly <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Cost you a fortune, wouldn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Th th then, there the field, if you got a field to turn it out in, provide hay ever day, buy tons of hay for it, that's alright.<endOfText>
<human>You don't want it to have a lot of corn.<endOfText>
<bot>You only want  corn when you're working them.<endOfText>
<human>When you're hunting them and doing things like that.<endOfText>
<bot>But hay  suits any animal.<endOfText>
<human>But you  that you can.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Going back to the war time, the Second World War, you said that racing wasn't considered to be an agricultural industry.<endOfText>
<bot>Breeding of horses was,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah<endOfText>
<bot>but not racing.<endOfText>
<human>So what, how did the racing industry get on during the war.<endOfText>
<bot>How did they manage?<endOfText>
<human>Well, they had to, they only raced at Newmarket.<endOfText>
<bot>All through the war, they raced at Newmarket see fetched it all to one meeting, so that they didn't have to travel about.<endOfText>
<human>See, the animal didn't have to travel about so and most of the trainers come here, you see.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh it was very good in the war time, cos there was only  just I can't tell you now.<endOfText>
<human>I could tell you offhand, if I'd known how, where the race was or  there's not many places.<endOfText>
<bot>but all, all my races was run at Newmarket.<endOfText>
<human>Some was run somewhere else, but I couldn't tell you where now, not offhand.<endOfText>
<bot>But all the races was run at Newmarket or Newmarket Heath.<endOfText>
<human>All everything.<endOfText>
<bot>That were all, all cos of the war, see?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>And, all run here, everything was run here, and animals, animals that won here, well er well I think they put them down as better animals than animals that raced before the war, you know, cos they had to do such a lot in a short time.<endOfText>
<human>You see, because all the Air Force had all the heath, they didn't have a lot of heath to train horses on, you know, then.<endOfText>
<bot>You only had little bits, they claimed  Waterhall for, for farming.<endOfText>
<human>We had to had to plough that up, and put and put er feed in it.<endOfText>
<bot>Where was this?<endOfText>
<human>Oh what we call Waterhall.<endOfText>
<bot>Waterhall?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, where you come down that hill from the boy's grave.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Well, on your right that's all, that's all Waterhall down there.<endOfText>
<bot>That's all training round in there.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>See?<endOfText>
<human>That's on the, mm, that's on the Kentford Road from Bury coming in, isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Then when you get down into Well Bottom.<endOfText>
<bot>You see a house on your left, don't you, pass the house on your left, well all on the right is a what they call the Limekilns.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>See?there the Limekilns are on  Well Bottom to the top of the Down.<endOfText>
<human>Till you get traffic lights.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>All laid out special, you know for training.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Galloping ground.<endOfText>
<bot>During the war you had to grow food on it, you said.<endOfText>
<human>What?<endOfText>
<bot>During the war you had to grow food on it, you said to me.<endOfText>
<human>Food.<endOfText>
<bot>You had to grow food <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>during the war,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>you had to grow food on those  areas,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>where you said.<endOfText>
<human>You weren't allowed to use them.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh no  you weren't allowed er  only the Limekilns we was allowed to use.<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes  they'd be erm, tt agriculture.<endOfText>
<bot>They'd ere pinch 'em, you see.<endOfText>
<human>They'd have to give so much away.<endOfText>
<bot>Same as the south fields they pinched all a lot of that.<endOfText>
<human>We had to grow potatoes and saffron everything, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>And these were usually on the training grounds <endOfText>
<human>Otherwise they'd have built on it or summat like that you see.<endOfText>
<bot>That's why we have to do it.<endOfText>
<human>But it's all, all back again in its own place now.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>See, but th th the south fields, what was, was a good training ground for all of us.<endOfText>
<bot>Two mile round, there was er the Air Force was on it, you see, the Ninety Ninth Squadron was, was down here see, all, all the war, all them, all that ground was under, under, all undermined with big petrol tanks.<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes, all down there that's where they bombed when the war was on and when they killed the people in the town.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes.<endOfText>
<human>Th this was a great place, this was, very, very, very dangerous.<endOfText>
<bot>Was there a lot of people killed with the bomb?<endOfText>
<human>One, two, four I, four I think  four I think was killed tt<endOfText>
<bot>Whereabouts did it fall?<endOfText>
<human>Outside the picture place.<endOfText>
<bot>Outside the er Odeon what you'd call it,you know where outside there it fell.<endOfText>
<human>Killed the girl in the Post Office, I know.<endOfText>
<bot>Post Office is this side of the road in them days.<endOfText>
<human>What, on the opposite of what it is now?<endOfText>
<bot>two, two and three in the town were killed.<endOfText>
<human>Market day it was, you know, oh yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>It was during the day?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I was down the paddocks, I was, I was.<endOfText>
<bot>I was down the paddock.<endOfText>
<human>Before, I couldn't get down the High Street for bricks and  houses, but  they're not there now.<endOfText>
<bot>I couldn't get out quick enough .<endOfText>
<human>I didn't know where it was.<endOfText>
<bot>How did the war affect yo your training of the horses?<endOfText>
<human>Oh, it didn't interfere didn't interfere with th didn't interfere, the only thing about it, you had to do everything in daylight, there were no lights allowed at nights, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm<endOfText>
<human>You didn't have none of this.<endOfText>
<bot>No electric lights.<endOfText>
<human>You had to do everything in daylight.<endOfText>
<bot>You know very, that was, that was about the hardest part about it, cos no sooner you were done, you had to start again you understand?<endOfText>
<human>Mm<endOfText>
<bot>Cos you had to get, do it with lights, and every window was blacked over, oh terrible.<endOfText>
<human>Terrible to work in it.<endOfText>
<bot>But er, we, we got through it all, didn't we?<endOfText>
<human>We got through it.<endOfText>
<bot>But that's, that's what happened.<endOfText>
<human>Did the horses do as well?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, oh yeah.<endOfText>
<human>They didn't worry about them, they  carried on just the same.<endOfText>
<bot>you done everything exactly the same, only you didn't have the  time to do it in.<endOfText>
<human>You  woke up about an hour, you know the nights are shorter .<endOfText>
<bot>Well, you see  you finish in the morning about half past, half past twelve we used to, cos no sooner you get your dinner and had a drink, you had to be back again two o'clock or half past two to start on 'em again, you see,<endOfText>
<human>Mm<endOfText>
<bot>which, so that you got the stables shut up before it got dark at four o'clock, ain't it <endOfText>
<human>Mm in the winter time mm.<endOfText>
<bot>see, for the lights  so you weren't allowed to put the lights on you see for the bombers.<endOfText>
<human>Show the Germans coming over, you know  see 'em now you didn't have no street lights, did you.<endOfText>
<bot>You didn't have no street lights.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>All treated all the same, you see.<endOfText>
<human>Mm<endOfText>
<bot>Ah ah.<endOfText>
<human>Did racing continue the same during the war?<endOfText>
<bot>Racing?<endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah, we raced just the same even though we had to do it early, so that some of them leave, and we started at sometimes half past eleven.<endOfText>
<bot>Finished at half past two, you see,you know, shortened it up like that.<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes, they, they got, they got through everything alright pretty good.<endOfText>
<bot>They're very good, very good indeed.<endOfText>
<human>Marvellous how it was run to tell you the truth.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, yes those horses come in horse boxes them days bit of luck instead of trains.<endOfText>
<human>They got them here, you see for the races.<endOfText>
<bot>They used to come a day or two beforehand, you see, so they could be settled down and then race.<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes, everything was, it was very well run, it was manoeuvred very very cutely it was.<endOfText>
<bot>Very, very cutely.<endOfText>
<human>But, of course you didn't, you didn't have the time to do a lot in  the muddy light beat you.<endOfText>
<bot>But you see you had to do as good as the same amount now, you know.<endOfText>
<human>You only got the same amount of money   end of the week.<endOfText>
<bot>You didn't get no more .<endOfText>
<human>No it wasn't easy.<endOfText>
<bot>Talking of rac the racing itself.<endOfText>
<human>Have the racecourses always been as they are today?<endOfText>
<bot>Or, or were they different in your childhood?<endOfText>
<human>No, always the same.<endOfText>
<bot>Just the same as they are today.<endOfText>
<human>You know there were no difference in them only  er as they go along now they're putting plastic rails up instead of being wooden, you see 'em there.<endOfText>
<bot>See so many accidents happen, you see they're putting plastic up now.<endOfText>
<human>Then when we're bump against it would just bends over, you see.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah, that's the only difference  they be doing every racecourse like that.<endOfText>
<bot>And you'll find in time th the racecourse'll be made of this here special stuff what they're galloping on.<endOfText>
<human>On the heath a special stuff they gallop on, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, the all-weather <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, the all-weather<endOfText>
<bot>gallops?<endOfText>
<human>yeah,wh what we call the all-weather gallop.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm<endOfText>
<human>Well, some of the racecourse gonna be made like that and it cost a fortune, mind ya.<endOfText>
<bot>I suppose Newmarket will be first one to make two,th they've got two courses here as it is you see.<endOfText>
<human>They'll do one, experience on it you see.<endOfText>
<bot>See how it goes and make it all, all the one meeting that have July course, like we was all through the winter.<endOfText>
<human>All through the war, with July course you know you see.<endOfText>
<bot>You didn't have no racing on the first course.<endOfText>
<human>Which is the first course?<endOfText>
<bot>the first one.<endOfText>
<human>Mm<endOfText>
<bot>As you go er the bottom one.<endOfText>
<human>Then there's one half way up up the Cambridge Road ain't there?<endOfText>
<bot>What one's that?<endOfText>
<human>July Course they call i they call that.<endOfText>
<bot>See, there's two racecourses in Newmarket.<endOfText>
<human>There's none in Newmarket, really.<endOfText>
<bot>There's a  there's erm  let me see one, two, three, there used to be one, two, four meetings in Burrough Wood and two in Stetchworth.<endOfText>
<human>See, the July Course comes under Stetchworth<endOfText>
<bot>Yes<endOfText>
<human>see, and n the first course comes under Burrou Burrou Burrough Wood you call it.<endOfText>
<bot>See.<endOfText>
<human>That's how they're so rich.<endOfText>
<bot>There's footmark, footpaths all over the heath you know, where people can walk, and they keep sticking sticks in the heath now, but they knock 'em down.<endOfText>
<human>They can't stop 'em.<endOfText>
<bot>They stick <endOfText>
<human>Well bits of sticks in <endOfText>
<bot>sticks in?<endOfText>
<human>you know, so they don't make paths for horses who jump over.<endOfText>
<bot>See, you can't stop the people walking on cos th th th it's a law, you see.<endOfText>
<human>There's a byelaw all paths you see.<endOfText>
<bot>So who puts the sticks in the ground?<endOfText>
<human>The heath men.<endOfText>
<bot>They do.<endOfText>
<human>You know, trying stop you from walking on the<endOfText>
<bot>Ah<endOfText>
<human>walking in the path.<endOfText>
<bot>But you pull them out chuck 'em aside you see people do.<endOfText>
<human>Th they don't take no notice of it.<endOfText>
<bot>See there was a case a little while ago weren't there, about farmer ploughed up a p footpath  you used to get on a stile to walk across the field.<endOfText>
<human>Then you used to get some they're all byelaws, weren't there.<endOfText>
<bot>Ah, in the end they fined him a lot of money, and they had him  can't stop the public, you can't do that you can't.<endOfText>
<human>No <endOfText>
<bot>So people walk over the racecourse, do they?<endOfText>
<human>Ah yeah, you can't stop people,<endOfText>
<bot>The July Course?<endOfText>
<human>The July Course, you see.<endOfText>
<bot>That was attached to for the July Course  the Jockey Club runs a long way right near round on to the Swaffham Road, yeah see runs right up, right up to the Swaffham Road, you see.<endOfText>

<human>Who's gonna do all th them years ago, was all horse and carts,<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>who was gonna  axles and the bicycles and everything like that.<endOfText>
<bot>But in Newmarket with the racing stables.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, there was always blacksmiths here.<endOfText>
<bot>Always blacksmiths.<endOfText>
<human>Did they have their own blacksmiths then, or would there be like in the town that went round ?<endOfText>
<bot>No, no, they didn't have.<endOfText>
<human>They used to have  some had their own blacksmiths.<endOfText>
<bot>The Honourable George  like Lord Derby, he had their own, always did.<endOfText>
<human>They've shops up there now, all got blacksmiths shop, you see.<endOfText>
<bot>Every stable.<endOfText>
<human>We had , you see, everything, everything, tooling for the plates, everything you wanna make.<endOfText>
<bot>Your irons used to come longer than this  irons, where you measure horses feet and you know, measure 'em up.<endOfText>
<human>You know they measure across from heel to toe<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>then across from there to there.<endOfText>
<bot>From side to side.<endOfText>
<human>Always do on a bed of wheat straw, so you nip it off from where the  you see, and you know your measurement.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah  asking a man on this television the other night,th the heath man.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know if you seen it or not.<endOfText>
<human>, his name is.<endOfText>
<bot>Now how can you tell the one horse from another?<endOfText>
<human>Well  he said it would be by the markings.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, but he wouldn't get the markings unless he be through me.<endOfText>
<human>Or somebody in the yard he was paying.<endOfText>
<bot>And you had to get, get a bit of paper and you drew a straight line, straight line, see like that, and if he had two white legs you put a cross, two white  see, if he had a long one, he had put a big cross, if he had a long, two long white leg, if he had me behind you put a cross.<endOfText>
<human>If he had a white face, you put a mark down that way  see.<endOfText>
<bot>So it's like marking the points out on a horse, with crosses?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I'll show you before you go, give you a bit of paper<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>wh where we used to mark 'em.<endOfText>
<bot>And when they say what we call 'em touts they were called then you know.<endOfText>
<human>Touts.<endOfText>
<bot>On the heath.<endOfText>
<human>Some people chase them away, wouldn't let you see horses work and all that, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, these were people trying to find out what horses might win a ra <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>yeah, be fit enough to win a race?<endOfText>
<human>Race, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Very strict years ago, very strict.<endOfText>
<bot>They used to get up trees with glasses and look  with everything they<endOfText>
<human>Would they?<endOfText>
<bot>Like spies .<endOfText>
<human>Oh, very strict years ago.<endOfText>
<bot>They wouldn't let you th see anything.<endOfText>
<human>Oh no  er er that's the secret of er  that was.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah, oh,h have a good look.<endOfText>
<human>Foggy mornings, you used to gallop them in the fog, the best, gallop horses in the fog.<endOfText>
<bot>See  say you don't gonna gallop five fur you didn't gallop five furlongs, well, they might think you're gonna finish five, you only galloped 'em four.<endOfText>
<human>See pulled up.<endOfText>
<bot>You done 'em all like that.<endOfText>
<human>Ah.<endOfText>
<bot>Get up early in the mornings,gallo take 'em out and gallop 'em, take 'em back in.<endOfText>
<human>Shut the gates.<endOfText>
<bot>Some of the men didn't know they'd been out exercising.<endOfText>
<human>Ah, I'm telling you the truth.<endOfText>
<bot>That's where I served my time they didn't  phew  <endOfText>
<human>These, these touts.<endOfText>
<bot>What were they looking for?<endOfText>
<human>Why, the books, report in the papers.<endOfText>
<bot>They all had a paper the Evening News, the Standard, the Star, the Sporting Life ah all the papers wanted to know about the horses.<endOfText>
<human>So the tr the owners who owned them them days you could read about them, but they don't do it today, cos the trainers ring them up and tell them how they're going, don't they?<endOfText>
<bot>So when you put these markings  on your piece of paper<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>They paid you for it, they had to pay, to pay <endOfText>
<human>Who paid you for doing that?<endOfText>
<bot>wanted them on the heath.<endOfText>
<human>What the heath men or the touts?<endOfText>
<bot>Touts.<endOfText>
<human>Ow!<endOfText>
<bot>Touts.<endOfText>
<human>Of course,yo you don't go tell him, it don't come on there does it.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos you can live down there  you know you're doing this you see.<endOfText>
<human>But that's how they used to know.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Al any mark or a white spot on them  all tricks of the trade.<endOfText>
<bot>If the lads had any brains th the touts used to say yearlings, they, in the yard got any, yes, get the markings for us, you see.<endOfText>
<human>They used take them and give them a drink.<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>But then, most of them relied on the head men, we used to tell them you see, to keep their mouth shut.<endOfText>
<bot>So that when we galloped them they didn't know, see, mm, years ago they were very particular an another man didn't li , say I had horses and you had horses, I wouldn't like my horses galloping with yours.<endOfText>
<human>See my meaning?<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>And th I, I wouldn't want yours galloping with mine.<endOfText>
<bot>You understand?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>So you had to be pally so that your owners help one another.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Get my meaning?<endOfText>
<human>So <endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah, they don't stand for that today, you know.<endOfText>
<human>Galloping one owner's horse with another.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh no.<endOfText>
<human>Phew, you'd be surprised.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh it ain't all, ain't all cushy, it's, it's a bit secret on some things, you know.<endOfText>
<human>Owners don't know everything.<endOfText>
<bot>If they see their horses done <endOfText>
<human>You shoot me when you have a read of that.<endOfText>
<bot>No <endOfText>
<human>Giving secrets away.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah, very, very, very  phew oh yeah, they didn't like it.<endOfText>
<human>They used to ring one another up  owners and they know one another in the yard.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh definitely, they don't mind helping one another.<endOfText>
<human>See?<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>That's why Lord  wouldn't have to give all that money.<endOfText>
<bot>What was it, ninety, ninety odd, ninety five thousand pound.<endOfText>
<human>won last week at somewhere didn wasn't last week to lead Slip Anchor.<endOfText>
<bot>To lead him work, instead of borrowing other people's in the yard.<endOfText>
<human>To lead him?<endOfText>
<bot>To lead the horse.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, you have to have a lead horse in work.<endOfText>
<bot>In front of your good ones.<endOfText>
<human>What so you can pace, be paced by it you mean?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah <endOfText>
<human>He's doing this horse now, Reckless Boy, he's leading him now.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah.<endOfText>
<human>That's why we Slip Anchor won so far he wasn't from here to  cross the road.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>See, cos he had this lead horse  you horses jumped off.<endOfText>
<bot>Made off couldn't catch him.<endOfText>
<human>That's what this one'll do.<endOfText>
<bot>You see.<endOfText>
<human>See him far up ahead.<endOfText>
<bot>They'll be coming down here saying thank you,what's the date today.<endOfText>
<human>Oh first of May tomorrow, yeah, no, Friday <endOfText>
<bot>Friday <endOfText>
<human>about the twenty ninth today.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, you can always say I missed tomorrow's till the end of April.<endOfText>
<human>They tell me he'll win the Derby.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Going well he is, I tell you.<endOfText>
<bot>Is he?<endOfText>
<human>I think th I think the Frenchman will win the one thousand tomorrow and er, will ride the winner of the two thousand, Different to Me, or something, it's called.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think  'll stay, myself.<endOfText>
<human>Different people, different opinions, that's my opinion.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>That's all I know.<endOfText>
<bot>So what would race days be like in<endOfText>
<human>Race days?<endOfText>
<bot>years ago?<endOfText>
<human>Oh, they stayed just the same as they are today,yo you carried on just the same, only the difference in them now, race days years ago, the heath was shut at half past nine.<endOfText>
<bot>You couldn't go on the heath and train horses up after half past nine.<endOfText>
<human>You understand, not this side.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Race people, race days you see, people come to their races and put their tents and things up.<endOfText>
<bot>And you all had to go over that side.<endOfText>
<human>Over the Bury side.<endOfText>
<bot>Over Bury side, where you come down that hill.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah<endOfText>
<bot>They always worked over that  and around there.<endOfText>
<human>The other places look across the heath as you come up the, the road anywhere, but not on this side.<endOfText>
<bot>Half past nine they finish.<endOfText>
<human>Same as the Limekilns, they are today.<endOfText>
<bot>There's a certain gallop on the Limekiln shut at half past nine.<endOfText>
<human>If it's not shut at half past nine, it don't open till half past nine.<endOfText>
<bot>You understand?<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>it don't open till all the  people have used the short gallops.<endOfText>
<human>See cos you have to cross over 'em.<endOfText>
<bot>You have to start at the top of the town that way, and go down over down and come round like that, finish off start down Norwich Road and come up Bury Road.<endOfText>
<human>So that's how far round it was.<endOfText>
<bot>I suppose  a mile and three quarters, I think.<endOfText>
<human>And one red house to the top of the  lights, traffic lights.<endOfText>
<bot>From one side of the road up the other.<endOfText>
<human>That's how it used to be years ago.<endOfText>
<bot>Of course I co couldn't tell you now the different ways, they do what they like now.<endOfText>
<human>That's all I can hear about <endOfText>
<bot>allowed to gallop his horses across the heath, er and all this rot.<endOfText>
<human>Terrible.<endOfText>
<bot>did erm on race days, how did they organize the races?<endOfText>
<human>When you were a young lad.<endOfText>
<bot>Organize  well, they organize theirselves.<endOfText>
<human>The jockeys<endOfText>
<bot>That's me, it's all right, it's my microphone.<endOfText>
<human>that's erm, erm nothing to do with us, the Jockey Club do all that.<endOfText>
<bot>Th they organized all the races.<endOfText>
<human>All we got to do is enter, enter the horses in you get a paper called the Calendar.<endOfText>
<bot>When you have that calendar sent you, it's a lot of money now.<endOfText>
<human>It used to be three and sixpence I think, it is about five pounds now.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, you look through it, and every race meeting that's on there, probably five or six weeks.<endOfText>
<human>And you look through every horse  wherever you want to put your horse in them races are in that Calendar and you pick your race out, put your horse in, pay your forfeit.<endOfText>
<bot>Then you have to pay another forfeit if you leave him in.<endOfText>
<human>Understand?<endOfText>
<bot>Pay another forfeit if you leave him?<endOfText>
<human>Forfeit.<endOfText>
<bot>You pay a forfeit to put him in that race.<endOfText>
<human>See, if you want him to stop in it, you gotta keep paying the forfeit all the time th them weeks that go by.<endOfText>
<bot>Same as years ago.<endOfText>
<human>I don't know, I don't think, think it's altered now, years ago you had to enter your y Derby horse.<endOfText>
<bot>You had to enter them as foals, and then when you entered them it cost you fifty pounds to enter them, and it cost you fifty pounds for every quarter of that lifetime of that foal.<endOfText>
<human>So you run in the Derby.<endOfText>
<bot>Why did you have to enter them as foals?<endOfText>
<human>Oh, I don't know, that was their idea, years ago.<endOfText>
<bot>But I think it's changed <endOfText>
<human>Just  <endOfText>
<bot>but I think it's changing now, I don't know.<endOfText>
<human>I, I, I been out it a long while now.<endOfText>
<bot>Did, did the racecourse used to be busy?<endOfText>
<human>What?<endOfText>
<bot>Busy, you couldn't get through the streets for charabancs and charabancs in them days.<endOfText>
<human>Cabs and all all lined up outside the White Hart Jockey Club Rooms.<endOfText>
<bot>All lined up the street.<endOfText>
<human>Cabs, you used to jump in and drive them up the road cos there were no motor cars.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh no  there weren't motor cars out for years, called them charabancs, charabancs you know.<endOfText>
<human>You used to meet in the Avenue, meet in the High Street.<endOfText>
<bot>What taxis?<endOfText>
<human>Meet at the station.<endOfText>
<bot>Used to be specials from the station.<endOfText>
<human>at station charabancs.<endOfText>
<bot>Ooh  all sorts, heath carts, donkey carts everything.<endOfText>
<human>So there was quite a bit of business in Newmarket for anyone who <endOfText>
<bot>Oh the pictures, it's a pity I haven't got some.<endOfText>
<human>I ain't got some of the old pictures for ya.<endOfText>
<bot>But it was a, a very good, very good in the old days.<endOfText>

<bot>Ooh ooh ooh  <endOfText>
<human>If we go now <endOfText>
<bot>Ha?<endOfText>
<human>Cos I did ea , by Monday I felt sick and I eat quite a lot at the weekend which was  good, but  Tuesday I start at placement and we, although like we talk, we don't have, like a, conversation we  as well and there wasn't really anything to record, saying  yesterday   to record  and<endOfText>
<bot>Did you record here yesterday?<endOfText>
<human>and she's, what's that?<endOfText>
<bot>Did you record here, yesterday?<endOfText>
<human>No  something so no, sort of, start at lunchtime anyway so I couldn't record any lunchtime.<endOfText>
<bot>No, in the morning we weren't doing a lot anyway, were we?<endOfText>
<human>No so there wasn't anything that I could record then  and the woman's coming tonight, to pick them up   <endOfText>
<bot>And you've only done, how many?<endOfText>
<human>Seven.<endOfText>
<bot>How many are you supposed to do?<endOfText>
<human>I've only done seven  Well there's twenty tapes and I've gotta do as many as I can, I haven't done half of them yet, but  if I could have them over the weekend I'd be able to do loads more cos I'm  working on Saturday, I'm going out Saturday, I think<endOfText>
<bot>I'm going out Sunday night  and I can ta take it then  and I'll be able to get another, like four or five tapes done.<endOfText>
<human>everyone thinks she's sat there  what's she done to her head?<endOfText>
<bot>It just depends where we're going cos I don't know what we're doing yet  So I'd and the woman's coming round tonight  so I'll just, sort of, say to her if I can keep it over the weekend I can do a lot more  so otherwise I'll feel a bit bad <endOfText>
<human>How much are you getting paid for it?<endOfText>
<bot>Twenty five pound voucher or something  Dunno what the vouchers are for  but that would be in my hand anyway<endOfText>
<human>Oh.<endOfText>
<bot>whatever I suppose.<endOfText>
<human>You ought to get, a voucher for what?<endOfText>
<bot>Don't know  I would think that it's, she told me twenty five pounds so I thought it was gonna be like cash or something  and then I read the thing that says twenty five pound voucher but it didn't say what for, it just says voucher  knowing my luck it'll be book tokens!<endOfText>
<human>Lovely!<endOfText>
<bot>Well I can still get a couple of Christmas presents with that anyway so it doesn't matter.<endOfText>
<human>Get Boots vouchers  cos <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>you can use them in Children's World can't you?<endOfText>
<bot>Can you?<endOfText>
<human>Yes  it's where I used mine.<endOfText>
<bot>But I'd still be able to use them anyway, cos all them Boot Boots smellies and stuff  so<endOfText>
<human>Yeah you can get  records and that there as well <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>can't you?<endOfText>
<bot>I got<endOfText>
<human>from Boots.<endOfText>

<human>She was working at the Body Shop part-time, she's back there three days working now or something.<endOfText>
<bot>She started on Monday  and <endOfText>
<human>Ha!<endOfText>
<bot>apparently she doesn't know why they sacked her  she said, they sacked  apparently something to do with she'd been asking too many questions or something  and but she <endOfText>
<human>That is  <endOfText>
<bot>cos  to be really eager because  she said erm  that she'd asked the bloke about staying on permanently and everything  and he said that it seemed the people who they were most impress impressed with after Christmas that can stay on permanently  so we said on the end, you've gotta be really eager and everything  so she apparently was asking loads of questions<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, Oh you can't sack her for that!<endOfText>
<bot>because she asked loads of questions!<endOfText>
<human>That's what I thought  I think that's out of order <endOfText>
<bot>That doesn't matter!<endOfText>
<human>and that's .<endOfText>
<bot>shop is supposed to make  at home <endOfText>
<human>Yeah <endOfText>
<bot>their employees.<endOfText>

<human>Not quite sure  but I'm not <endOfText>
<bot>Never going  again.<endOfText>
<human>quite sure why  and I don't know  how long she's working there.<endOfText>
<bot>Maybe there's more to it than that, you never know.<endOfText>
<human>Well she's supposed to be working there 'till Christmas anyway  but<endOfText>
<bot>You'd better learn to drive then.<endOfText>
<human>Quick five minute walking, you know<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know, you see, I just heard that she'd been sacked and<endOfText>

<human>conjuctivitus.<endOfText>
<bot>Ooh!<endOfText>
<human>Ah !<endOfText>
<bot>It's going round our nursery.<endOfText>
<human>I woke up yesterday morning, I couldn't open my eyes!<endOfText>
<bot>At our day nursery.<endOfText>
<human>Urgh!<endOfText>
<bot>So have you got like drops or something?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, drops and this  revolting cream  that smells foul!<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah  under.<endOfText>
<human>Did <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>You look really lovely, as you've got bloodshot eyes and this yellow  cream.<endOfText>
<human>.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh you've  <endOfText>
<human>Nice!<endOfText>
<bot>Liner!<endOfText>
<human>And it's a lot, yesterday I was in a real state  notice my eyes were just totally, gummed up, yuk!<endOfText>
<bot>Actually they're probably .<endOfText>
<human>Wake up in the morning .<endOfText>
<bot>That's right, right let's  the brushes now, class.<endOfText>
<human>Well, are we painting them today?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Ooh!<endOfText>
<bot>No, we're  !<endOfText>
<human>Yeah <endOfText>
<bot>and stare at the .<endOfText>
<human>Now what you do <endOfText>
<bot>Why not?<endOfText>
<human>I can't <endOfText>
<bot>Alright?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>You're going to paint them <endOfText>
<human>Can you keep still for a minute, Kim?<endOfText>
<bot>I tipped something on them.<endOfText>
<human>You're gonna paint them exactly as you would  if you were just doing it on paper  alright?<endOfText>
<bot>God!<endOfText>
<human>It's quite a strange thing to paint on because it's a very absorbent surface  and what happens if you wa , those of you who want subtle colours, well that's fine  cos you get very subtle colours  if you want deep colours like black  dark brown  or a bright colour like bright red berries on the holly  then we have to put varnish on  alright?<endOfText>
<bot>And it brings the colours up to really, really vibrant  dense colours  alright?<endOfText>
<human>But I suspect a lot of you would want to leave them with a matt finish, it's entirely up to you  Anyway  when you paint, like I say, it's just it's because it's porous  it sucks the colour off the brush and er  it immediately dries, so you can see, straight away, the colour it's gonna be  when you then put the varnish on you use a sort of matt varnish and  so it brings the colour up but it won't be shiny  or a shine, which you're gonna choose  like you might wanna matt varnish with this and shiny for the shell  which ca it really brings the colour up, we won't get round to varnishing today  erm  and the other thing you can do, if you want  erm  a sort of a mottled effect  you do pink in a base colour  say Mikila wanted all  greeny, bluey colours on that <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah I do.<endOfText>
<human>oh well, there you go  paint it all  a fairly pale green  and then rubbing on dried powder paint  like, almost like using pastels <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah I just want loads of different shades of green and blues   <endOfText>
<human>Like using pastels, you just  rub it on with your finger and get really  subtle blend of  there so, you can have it plain black and white or  brilliant red  or  you know, very subtle, so you can get all sorts of paint effects on them  okay?<endOfText>
<bot>What I suggest you do is, sort of, give them all a base coat, you know, like  do all this mid-brown, but darker brown on the shell  okay?<endOfText>
<human>Black and white.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, now<endOfText>
<human>Do we have to paint underneath the side?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I think it's best to, yeah  yeah, I mean o the best thing to do is actually lift it up and use a little bit of the underneath to try out the colours  what colour's that going to be?<endOfText>
<human>I don't know  I haven't decided.<endOfText>
<bot>What colour's yours going to be,?<endOfText>
<human>Black  pale brown underneath  and brown edges  <endOfText>
<bot>I think grey might be quite nice, for the walls, but then  rubbing other colours all over it, sort of you know, like mauvey and   colours and blues.<endOfText>
<human>I'll do these two all over grey.<endOfText>
<bot>Really burn my arm.<endOfText>
<human>Yes <endOfText>
<bot>Try not to  do it as you go, I mean, try to have a very definite idea in your mind what you want to do cos otherwise, you know, you start off, you've painted half of it grey and think oh don't like it like this bit!<endOfText>
<human>So try and decide, I mean, obviously a lot <endOfText>
<bot>Brown.<endOfText>
<human>of them they're, you know<endOfText>
<bot>Brown .<endOfText>
<human>you don't, you don't have to do it brown though, you know, I mean whatever colour you want.<endOfText>
<bot>I want it bright.<endOfText>
<human>I'm <endOfText>
<bot>If you wanna have a purple hedgehog, it's entirely up to you!<endOfText>
<human>No leave that one.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay?<endOfText>
<human>Okay?<endOfText>
<bot>Will these all stick back on?<endOfText>
<human>They all will stick back on, it's best to paint them first and then stick them on.<endOfText>
<bot>Right I've gotta go and find some more of those,<endOfText>
<human>This isn't his tail he keeps standing on!<endOfText>
<bot>I worked that out!<endOfText>
<human>It must be there<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah it's there somewhere, it's just a bit too big to be  <endOfText>
<human>Unless Emma's got it as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Unless Emma's got it there.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah fine.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I know she could have.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>What's yours gonna be, Eva?<endOfText>
<bot>What colour?<endOfText>
<human>Just that colour on there, on the other one.<endOfText>
<bot>How much ?<endOfText>
<human>Purple?<endOfText>
<bot>Bright red!<endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Bright purple !<endOfText>
<human>!<endOfText>
<bot>I can't do much, sort of, colouring, someone's taken .<endOfText>
<human>Well it's all black<endOfText>
<bot>apart from that bit there's white.<endOfText>
<human>that will be white, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>You imagine like a penguin suit, aren't the wings?<endOfText>
<human>Different colours  aren't they?<endOfText>
<bot>No I thought they were all black <endOfText>
<human>No they're not are they?<endOfText>
<bot>They're just<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>a piece here was white  but you want to do <endOfText>
<human>I'm gonna do a  !<endOfText>
<bot>colour in the eye, colour on the beak, colour on feet<endOfText>
<human>Yeah <endOfText>
<bot>and the yellow<endOfText>
<human>little red buttons and stuff <endOfText>
<bot>and the yellow.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>just bring it out.<endOfText>
<human>shiny buttons, you can put on this silver<endOfText>
<bot>our little red flower on the hat.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah I've got a little bit of silver and gold at home actually, but I didn't bring it in today <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I should've done, but <endOfText>
<bot>I think I'll do this like  reds, and blacks and <endOfText>
<human>okay.<endOfText>
<bot>whites an <endOfText>
<human>So decide  your work before hand <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, that'll do.<endOfText>
<human>Brown.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay?<endOfText>
<human>Right <endOfText>
<bot>Right if you didn't pay attention there, I don't see any others from next door because  the colour they can start with <endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>do it like that  you need a piece of paper and lots of water  and I'll just go and get brushes .<endOfText>
<human>Where are they , in the corridor  down there?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I don't know what colour to do it.<endOfText>

<bot>Yeah but if you if you <endOfText>
<human>If you have the pale, I suppose.<endOfText>

<bot>What do you want ink on?<endOfText>
<human>The tail  gonna have to do the tail now.<endOfText>

<bot>See he doesn't really want much brown on him he just needs a coat.<endOfText>
<human>Don't like this colour now.<endOfText>
<bot>Well I'm not putting it, I'm putting other colours on top of it.<endOfText>
<human>Oh that's alright then.<endOfText>
<bot>Purple and that.<endOfText>
<human>That's red.<endOfText>
<bot>That's black.<endOfText>
<human>That's yellow.<endOfText>
<bot>Yellow.<endOfText>
<human>Do you see what I mean?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Unless I mean this hedgehog could have been done if I left it  couldn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Okay?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>That's black <endOfText>
<human>Okay?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And what colour's his hat gonna be?<endOfText>
<bot>Probably red.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>black with a red band.<endOfText>
<human>If you like you could open one of those little wheels if it, especially a difficult one like yours Emma.<endOfText>
<bot>It might be a good idea.<endOfText>
<human>I'll go and get you one.<endOfText>
<bot>Thanks.<endOfText>
<human>Sorry did I get you?<endOfText>
<bot>No it's alright.<endOfText>
<human>I just wiped it all over my .<endOfText>
<bot>I was just about to say I expect you could really make a mess if you tried and then I realized I was covered in  and I'd better shut up.<endOfText>
<human>As long as the fire alarms don't go off I don't mind.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh  twice  <endOfText>
<human>Again.<endOfText>
<bot>Well Wednesday when I was in, I teach up until five on a Wednesday and kept  coming up and saying that all the lights were gonna go off.<endOfText>
<human>That the electricity board was doing some work  so not to get the class started.<endOfText>
<bot>Well no-one ever knew that the fire alarms were going off.<endOfText>
<human>No-one at all.<endOfText>
<bot>I think someone was just taking the mickey and kept setting them off.<endOfText>
<human>Well they went off twice.<endOfText>
<bot>I think they must have done  <endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Well from here I can see all sorts of bits so I suggest if you get <endOfText>
<human>Yeah I know.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's put erm a piece of paper <endOfText>
<human>How am I gonna ?<endOfText>
<bot>on there and then you'll be able to  sorry Emma I didn't hear what you said.<endOfText>
<human>How am I gonna paint under that black<endOfText>
<bot>Very carefully  <endOfText>
<human>without getting the red red and the red<endOfText>
<bot>Well if you hold a piece of paper there.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah?<endOfText>
<bot>Get a small piece of paper and hold there as you do it.<endOfText>
<human>Thing is every spike's gonna be changed a different colour anyway so.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah but you want to  make sure you haven't got any<endOfText>
<human>under here.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Before you finish doing that just lift it up and paint in round under here look.<endOfText>
<bot>You've got a<endOfText>
<human>Got a line.<endOfText>
<bot>bare bottom.<endOfText>
<human>That's the sort of colour you want for the top of your  isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>If you want to use another colour just check round and see what other people have got, alright?<endOfText>
<human>Cos it's pointless keep making up loads of paints when other people have already mixed the colour up.<endOfText>
<bot>And share the colours.<endOfText>
<human>bits.<endOfText>
<bot>As my children say.<endOfText>
<human>You must co-operate.<endOfText>
<bot>Watching too much Sesame Street.<endOfText>
<human>Co-operation  <endOfText>
<bot>Is that from Sesame Street is it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh right.<endOfText>
<human>I think I was probably watching too much Sesame Street as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>I'm getting his eyes.<endOfText>
<bot>There we go.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>How do I paint in there then?<endOfText>
<human>What do you <endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>There and there and there and underneath.<endOfText>
<bot>My frog is called Basil.<endOfText>
<human>get a small piece of paper  <endOfText>
<bot>What about the hedgehog?<endOfText>
<human>Harry  isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>paint that side you see.<endOfText>
<human>And then it won't go on to this side.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you with me?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Basil the tree frog.<endOfText>
<human>Okay?<endOfText>
<bot>So you can get the brush in  goes against the paper.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah but the thing is  <endOfText>
<bot>I'm sorry Emma it had to be done.<endOfText>
<human>Well you'll just  very carefully.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean if it's right at the back it doesn't matter if it's black or red.<endOfText>
<human>It's just gonna  shadow anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Okay?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh my god  <endOfText>
<human>This is not gonna be fun  all his spikes.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm just going to wash my brush.<endOfText>
<human>I think you ought to put flowers all over him.<endOfText>
<bot>Daisies.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah why not?<endOfText>
<bot>Lovely colour <endOfText>
<human>Big pink ones.<endOfText>
<bot>Go for it.<endOfText>
<human>Orange.<endOfText>
<bot>Why not?<endOfText>
<human>Be creative.<endOfText>
<bot>Look at my hedgehog.<endOfText>
<human>He should be brown but he's not.<endOfText>
<bot>Go on Eva.<endOfText>
<human>Be a daredevil.<endOfText>
<bot>It's lucky it's not actually a boy now.<endOfText>
<human>I was gonna say if you had flowers on it it'd be a bit <endOfText>
<bot>bit .<endOfText>
<human>Ooh.<endOfText>
<bot>That's nice!<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Basil the tropical free  free I keep saying, tree frog.<endOfText>
<human>He's gonna have some colours on top of them .<endOfText>
<bot>Thing is I bet you the spikes that goes exactly next door to him I'll paint yellow.<endOfText>
<human>What colours are frog's nails <endOfText>
<bot>Pinky.<endOfText>
<human>Pinky red   You could have flowers all over your frog as well.<endOfText>
<bot>We could have a real  hippie parade couldn't we?<endOfText>
<human>Hippie frog.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh no.<endOfText>
<human>I've got black on it.<endOfText>

<human>Is it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Oh we've got next term haven't we?<endOfText>

<human>Emma was that?<endOfText>
<bot>What do you want?<endOfText>
<human>Can I have a tiny bit of your glue.<endOfText>
<bot>You may.<endOfText>
<human>What are they to finish painting and do a bit <endOfText>
<bot>Inside?<endOfText>
<human>Dark green?<endOfText>
<bot>Do some  <endOfText>
<human>Or pink  or red.<endOfText>
<bot>Er it depends on how much you want to make it stand out.<endOfText>
<human>I think I would probably do it dark green.<endOfText>
<bot>Dark green, mm.<endOfText>
<human>Sort of colour Emma's  that that colour without being altered is is fine.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Do it with a small brush.<endOfText>
<bot>Alright.<endOfText>
<human>Or you know  sludgy sort of colour like  this<endOfText>
<bot>I think I'm gonna do it dark green.<endOfText>
<human>This is gonna look well weird.<endOfText>
<bot>I need a brush with a bend in it to get under here.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>That's what I need too.<endOfText>
<human>I love this hippo.<endOfText>
<bot>This is really .<endOfText>
<human>I love the shape of his legs.<endOfText>
<bot>He's lost a tooth <endOfText>
<human>Has he?<endOfText>
<bot>Ah!<endOfText>
<human>He's been to the dentist.<endOfText>
<bot>Well you must stick it, you must stick it back in there.<endOfText>
<human>Right  so let's have a go.<endOfText>
<bot>This has got to be red.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah this is gonna be fun.<endOfText>
<bot>It's gonna be like a jigsaw puzzle.<endOfText>
<human>Keep your brush wet Fiona and then the colour will sort of flow in there.<endOfText>
<bot>He was nearly a dead hedgehog then because he nearly fell off the table.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah do him as an old hedgehog.<endOfText>
<bot>We got a hippie hippo.<endOfText>
<human>An old hedgehog.<endOfText>

<human>Green and?<endOfText>
<bot>Don't know.<endOfText>
<human>Don't know.<endOfText>
<bot>You might as well just get a brown.<endOfText>
<human>No I want to make it.<endOfText>
<bot>Green and yellow makes brown.<endOfText>
<human>Red and black.<endOfText>
<bot>Not red and black.<endOfText>
<human>Red and black make brown as well don't they?<endOfText>
<bot>Subtle colour.<endOfText>

<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>And I'm gonna paint red in his mouth as well.<endOfText>

<bot>Well she could be  for all we know.<endOfText>
<human>Right no other mix ups.<endOfText>
<bot>I thought you said she could be.<endOfText>
<human>I didn't say anyone.<endOfText>
<bot>I said the examiner thought she could be.<endOfText>

<bot>Could be a bloke <endOfText>
<human>Yeah I know he could but I  I said she, I said either.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  it's not working quite how I wanted it to but if I keep putting stuff on then<endOfText>
<human>I think the yellow's a bit strong.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I'll  stick something over it and  knock it <endOfText>
<bot>This is just a mess now.<endOfText>
<human>I should have just done it green.<endOfText>

<bot>Cos I was gonna use  colours but I don't know if it's going to  or not now.<endOfText>
<human>Well I think it looks really nice.<endOfText>
<bot>Tell you what I would do is mix some slightly different colour green <endOfText>
<human>By the way his  fell out.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>that's a slightly lighter colour.<endOfText>

<bot>It really does come up .<endOfText>
<human>What, with the shiny varnish?<endOfText>
<bot>No either.<endOfText>
<human>You don't have to erm  I mean you could also  only put varnish on certain bits of it.<endOfText>

<human>I'm gonna paint him in a really bright colour and then put the<endOfText>
<bot>Oh it looks nice.<endOfText>
<human>Do you reckon that'll look alright, or do you think I should paint them brown?<endOfText>
<bot>I don't like it like that though, so <endOfText>
<human>I dunno.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm being fussy I know but<endOfText>
<human>Paint him a bright colour and then  <endOfText>
<bot>But it's just weird.<endOfText>
<human>I don't like it at all.<endOfText>
<bot>If I paint a bright colour over the top of it  then that'll go sort of weird won't it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So I'll do it like that.<endOfText>
<human>I might use purple actually, I like the purple.<endOfText>
<bot>As long as it doesn't go black.<endOfText>
<human>But I don't wanna use it .<endOfText>
<bot>Well make a different<endOfText>
<human>orange.<endOfText>

<human>Oh dear.<endOfText>
<bot>It's alright .<endOfText>
<human>Why don't you kind of dabble it on, Mikila?<endOfText>

<human>You mean like that  dabble it on?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Or a bit less?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>

<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay?<endOfText>
<human>Okay, mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Let me just er<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>

<bot>It can be the centrepiece.<endOfText>
<human>Stick it further down so <endOfText>
<bot>Well a lot of the spikes are <endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>If you've finished  or if you've finished for today.<endOfText>
<human>This  paint I want it really really really well washed out of these brushes.<endOfText>
<bot>It's erm very good covering powder, it actually stays in the brushes.<endOfText>
<human>So, give the brush a really good wash out, put it back into it's proper pointed shape.<endOfText>
<bot>Alright?<endOfText>
<human>If you would please.<endOfText>

<human>Has he got a flower on it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>You could put it over that  big scar thing on it.<endOfText>

<bot>Christmas Carol has a certain old miser in it.<endOfText>
<human>Scrooge.<endOfText>
<bot>Scrooge.<endOfText>
<human>Okay good.<endOfText>
<bot>Now looking round I prefer you to be in twos and threes for the job you're going to do.<endOfText>
<human>Erm I'm not saying you can't well what do I say.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm can you is it possible to get twos rather threes.<endOfText>
<human>Can you sit <endOfText>
<bot>We'll be in threes.<endOfText>
<human>Mm?<endOfText>
<bot>We'll be in threes.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah alright.<endOfText>
<bot>Shh.<endOfText>
<human>Okay now  Neil we need your attention cos you you got a list of what you're going to do.<endOfText>
<bot>Now.<endOfText>
<human>So what you're going to do is erm sounds complicated but once you start you'll see how it works.<endOfText>
<bot>Now if you remember if you find in your book er you started just doing er a hundred er mini saga fifty words mini saga of David Copperfield  okay?<endOfText>
<human>Most of you did roughed it out on the back and some very quick workers who got it back in the front.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah?<endOfText>
<human>Now if you leave can I suggest leave erm leave half a page empty if you haven't got it in the front yet.<endOfText>
<bot>Don't go don't do any  If you haven't copied it up yet leave half a page.<endOfText>
<human>If you want leave a page for some homework.<endOfText>
<bot>Jenny what have you got to tell me?<endOfText>
<human>Okay well I'll give I'll give one back I've got them here.<endOfText>
<bot>Now erm no if you so leave a say leave a page would be the easiest way to fill in your mini saga account of David Copperfield meeting his new father.<endOfText>
<human>If you haven't got it in already.<endOfText>
<bot>Er some of you have got it in.<endOfText>
<human>I can see  they've got it in.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm put a heading er, The test of David Copperfield, but you're not doing the test you're making up the test.<endOfText>
<human>you know in the er first year with Miss  I genuinely wrote this thing right.<endOfText>
<bot>And they  this paragraph okay.<endOfText>
<human>Once you'd done a new paragraph like they did like this  blah blah blah  in here.<endOfText>
<bot>They she did a new paragraph like that and then she carried on like that.<endOfText>
<human>All the way.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah  all the way down the page.<endOfText>
<human>So funny .<endOfText>
<bot>what the paragraph was?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Listen please.<endOfText>
<human>Erm each pair  each pair no I haven't just listen.<endOfText>
<bot>Can you listen er each pair of you now will get a job of doing this.<endOfText>
<human>Now listen cos I don't want to explain it more than once.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm going to ask you to make up make up and write down four questions on the passage.<endOfText>
<human>Right?<endOfText>
<bot>Now then er find the correct answers.<endOfText>
<human>You what you're going to do I'll explain briefly.<endOfText>
<bot>You're going to make up a a test sheet each pair er you're going to cop you're going to rough it out in your book.<endOfText>
<human>Work out the answers for the  test.<endOfText>
<bot>Then you can put the test on a piece of paper just the questions and I'm going to give the piece of paper to somebody else to answer.<endOfText>
<human>So each you're going to test each other on this.<endOfText>
<bot>Now how's it work.<endOfText>
<human>Finding correct answers.<endOfText>
<bot>Now we start off I'll ask you I give you about ten minutes that's all it doesn't take long.<endOfText>
<human>First one an easy question.<endOfText>
<bot>Now what I mean by an easy question something like<endOfText>
<human>What he  where did he go <endOfText>
<bot>Yes hang hang on .<endOfText>
<human>Somebody suggested an easy question was anybody would get right.<endOfText>
<bot>Who was say  where go on.<endOfText>
<human>Right which where did where did he spend his holiday.<endOfText>
<bot>And the answer would be<endOfText>
<human>Yarmouth.<endOfText>
<bot>Great Yarmouth or Yarmouth whatever it's called.<endOfText>
<human>Is it Great Yarmouth or Yarmouth.<endOfText>
<bot>Yarmouth.<endOfText>
<human>Great Yarmouth.<endOfText>
<bot>Yarmouth.<endOfText>
<human>And you'd get a mark.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay that would be worth one mark .<endOfText>
<human>Yarmouth.<endOfText>
<bot>You just  <endOfText>
<human>Now and after this question <endOfText>
<bot>and Sabrina you did and Andrea's .<endOfText>
<human>which means a sentence answer.<endOfText>
<bot>Sentence answer two marks.<endOfText>
<human>A more difficult question or a difficult question sentence answer sentence question sentence length three marks three marks.<endOfText>
<bot>Lastly lastly a longer question where the answer would have to be two and three sentences  erm yes but don't tell everybody.<endOfText>
<human>Erm  shh.<endOfText>
<bot>Right I'm not giving you long to do this don't waste time.<endOfText>
<human>Now you've gotta make up four questions.<endOfText>
<bot>The first one's easy.<endOfText>
<human>You some of you are already thinking of easy things to ask.<endOfText>
<bot>Could be a one word answer.<endOfText>
<human>Question two the answer must be in a sentence.<endOfText>
<bot>So if if you ask the question erm or if you ask the question who something something the answer would be a name the person who did this was so and so.<endOfText>
<human>The you've gotta you mark it you give full marks for a sentence answer.<endOfText>
<bot>So when you mark somebody's test paper you don't just put the name and not the sentence you've gotta work out one mark out of two whatever.<endOfText>
<human>You work out a marking .<endOfText>
<bot>Now the difficult the last one is a hard one in the sense that it'll ask the person to write a paragraph, several sentences.<endOfText>
<human>So it could you could ask a question like erm, What was the relationship like between David and his mother?<endOfText>
<bot>Or you could ask a question like, What was the  father?<endOfText>
<human>Or or some vague question like that er for which you must work out the answers.<endOfText>
<bot>Now so what you're going to do you work together but I would prefer you in twos and threes  I think third person's redundant.<endOfText>
<human>Why why don't erm why don't you two work together?<endOfText>
<bot>Why not?<endOfText>
<human>Best friends.<endOfText>
<bot>But I'm but I'm working with<endOfText>
<human>Yeah but if I I'll only get one test paper from all three of you won't I?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm<endOfText>
<human>Yeah what's he on about?<endOfText>
<bot>Okay well see how it goes.<endOfText>
<human>Right erm well actually you could work on your own if you want to.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm getting short of test papers.<endOfText>
<human>So right here we go.<endOfText>
<bot>Right will you you may work together to work out.<endOfText>
<human>Work out your questions and give the answers with a mark scheme.<endOfText>
<bot>You can mark these in your book yeah.<endOfText>
<human>No you can do them at the front.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh oh if it's gonna be rough put them at.<endOfText>
<human>Oh how rough is it gonna be.<endOfText>
<bot>Rough notes at the back.<endOfText>
<human>Cos when you've worked out the questions you can put them at the front.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you.<endOfText>
<human>I just  from here.<endOfText>
<bot>D'ya want some more?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>I am.<endOfText>
<human>On you go ten minutes work out your four questions as per .<endOfText>
<bot>Sir where shall I write the answers?<endOfText>
<human>Erm you put the answers under your question.<endOfText>
<bot>Because the person won't see those.<endOfText>
<human>Er Jenny were you away on Monday?<endOfText>
<bot>Have you got that on tape?<endOfText>

<human>Okay?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah do write down the answers.<endOfText>
<human>That's going to add up to seven eight nine ten marks.<endOfText>

<human>Oh yeah .<endOfText>
<bot>Someone fancies him.<endOfText>
<human>Can't remember who it is.<endOfText>

<human>So you you will accept for number two just the two words you don't want a sentence?<endOfText>
<bot>Okay so long as you know.<endOfText>
<human>You must know what you want.<endOfText>
<bot>So if somebody just writes those two words they get two marks.<endOfText>
<human>You see.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos if you said erm answer in complete sentences they obviously wouldn't get two marks you see?<endOfText>
<human>Are they supposed to get four marks for that  <endOfText>

<human>One two three four.<endOfText>
<bot>Now er in the last sentence you've got five marks to give for spelling and punctuation.<endOfText>
<human>Right up to five marks.<endOfText>

<bot>Oh here comes Caroline.<endOfText>
<human>You can guarantee that over during the five ten fifteen years ten thousand ozone molecules are going to be taken up discarded and left.<endOfText>
<bot>And what happens to the little oxygens once they're discarded is that they don't go back and join an oxygen molecule.<endOfText>
<human>What they actually do is the two independent ones join together and instead of have separate Os you get O two again.<endOfText>
<bot>So all the O threes have been chopped down and you get O twos forming.<endOfText>
<human>You'll think of it again in a minute.<endOfText>
<bot>Sir is it possible to <endOfText>
<human>Right this is extremely easy to reduce .<endOfText>
<bot>to reduce the  <endOfText>
<human>Have you got red?<endOfText>

<bot>Billions.<endOfText>
<human>Billions and billions.<endOfText>
<bot>Sir?<endOfText>
<human>Sir what happens to them again when they're discard they're all .<endOfText>
<bot>When they're discarded the single O atoms doesn't go and join the O twos to make ozone again it just goes  another single O and then when .<endOfText>
<human>Well why can't they find .<endOfText>
<bot>Cos it's very difficult no two  is is very possessive<endOfText>
<human>Got a red.<endOfText>

<bot>Erm there were a couple of people who got all the  questions correct.<endOfText>
<human>There were one or two that er had  which was good as well.<endOfText>

<bot>Yeah, doesn't look like her hair.<endOfText>
<human>That, that boy was  's brother.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I know.<endOfText>
<human>Sir, do you wanna say something?<endOfText>
<bot>The wind was a  of darkness, among the gusty trees.<endOfText>
<human>The moon was a ghostly galleon, tossed upon cloudy seas.<endOfText>
<bot>The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor.<endOfText>
<human>And the highwayman came riding, riding, riding.<endOfText>
<bot>The highwayman came riding up to the old inn door.<endOfText>
<human>He'd a french cocked hat on his forehead, a bunch of  at his chin, a coat of claret velvet and breeches of brown doe skin.<endOfText>
<bot>They fitted with ne'er a wrinkle.<endOfText>
<human>His boots were up to the thigh, and he rode with a jewelled twinkle, his pistols but a twinkle, his rapier hilt a twinkle under the jewelled sky.<endOfText>
<bot>Over the cobbles he clattered, and clashed in the darkened yard, and he tapped with his  on the shutters, but all was locked and barred.<endOfText>
<human>He whistled a tune to the window, but who should be waiting there?<endOfText>
<bot>But the landlord's black eyed daughter, Bess.<endOfText>
<human>The landlord's daughter, plaiting a dark red love knot, into her long black hair.<endOfText>
<bot>And in the dark old inn yard, a stable  creaked.<endOfText>
<human>Where Tom the ostler listened, his face was white and peaked.<endOfText>
<bot>His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay.<endOfText>
<human>But he loved the landlord's daughter, the landlord's red-lipped daughter.<endOfText>
<bot>Dumb as a dog he listened, and heard the robber say, One kiss my bonny sweetheart, I'm after a prize tonight, but I shall be back with the yellow gold, before the morning light.<endOfText>
<human>Though didst they pass me sharply, and hang through the day.<endOfText>
<bot>Then look for me by moonlight, watch for me by moonlight, I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell shall bar the way.<endOfText>
<human>He rose up light in the stirrups, He scarce could reach her hand, but she loosened her  casement, his face burnt like a brand.<endOfText>
<bot>As the black  perfume came tumbling over his breast, and he kissed it sweet  in the moonlight, a sweet  in the moonlight, and he tugged at his reigns in the moonlight, and galloped away to the west.<endOfText>
<human>He did not come in the dawning.<endOfText>
<bot>He did not come at noon.<endOfText>
<human>But out oh tawny sunset, before the rise on moon, when the road was a gypsy ribbon, looping the purple moor, a red coat troop came marching, marching, marching, King George's men came marching, up to the old inn door.<endOfText>
<bot>They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead, but they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of a narrow bed.<endOfText>
<human>Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets their side.<endOfText>
<bot>There was death at every window, and hell on one dark window.<endOfText>
<human>That Bess could see through her casement, the road that he would ride.<endOfText>
<bot>They tied her up to a tension, with many si sniggering jest.<endOfText>
<human>They bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast.<endOfText>
<bot>Now come good watch they listened, she heard the robber moan, she heard the dead man say, look for me by moonlight, watch for me by moonlight, I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell shall bar the way.<endOfText>
<human>she twisted her hands behind her, but all the knots held good.<endOfText>
<bot>She  her hands to her fingers, all wet with sweat or blood.<endOfText>
<human>They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years.<endOfText>
<bot>Till now on the stroke of midnight, cold on the stroke of midnight, the tip of one finger touched it, the trigger at last was hers.<endOfText>
<human>The tip of one finger touched it, she strove no more for the rest, up sh up she stood to attention with the barrel beneath her breast.<endOfText>
<bot>She would not risk their hearing, she would not strive again, for the road lay bare in the moonlight, blank and bare in the moonlight, and the blood of her veins in the moonlight, throbbed to her lovers refrain.<endOfText>
<human>Had they heard it?<endOfText>
<bot>The horse's hooves ringing clear?<endOfText>
<human>In the distance, were they deaf that they could not hear?<endOfText>
<bot>Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill, the highwayman came riding, riding, riding, the highwayman came riding.<endOfText>
<human>The redcoat looked at the .<endOfText>
<bot>She stood up straight and still.<endOfText>
<human>In the frosty silence  In the echoing night.<endOfText>
<bot>Nearer and nearer he came, her face was like a light.<endOfText>
<human>Her eyes grew wide for one moment, she drew one last deep breath.<endOfText>
<bot>Then her finger moved in the moonlight, her musket shattered the moonlight, shattered her breast in the moonlight, and warned him with her death.<endOfText>
<human>He turned and sped westward, he did not know who stood, bowed with her head o'er a musket, drenched with her own  blood.<endOfText>
<bot>Not till the dawn he heard it, and slowly blanched to hear, how Bess the landlord's daughter, the landlord's black eyed daughter, had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.<endOfText>
<human>Back he sped like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky.<endOfText>
<bot>With the white road smoking behind him, and his rapier brandished high.<endOfText>
<human>Blood, blood red were his spurs,moon, rhymed red with his velvet coat, when they shot him down on the highway, down like a dog on the highway, and he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.<endOfText>
<bot>And still of a winter's night they say, when the wind is in the trees, when the moon is a ghostly galleon, tossed upon cloudy seas.<endOfText>
<human>When the road is a ribbon of moonlight, over the purple moor, a highwayman comes riding, riding, riding, a highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn door.<endOfText>
<bot>Over the cobbles he clatters, and clangs in the darkened yard, and he taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred.<endOfText>
<human>He whistles a tune to the window, and who shall be waiting there?<endOfText>
<bot>But the landlord's black eyed daughter.<endOfText>
<human>Bess, the landlord's daughter, plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair .<endOfText>
<bot>Lisa Stansfield?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>I think, I think that song's rubbish.<endOfText>
<bot>What do you hate the charity it's for?<endOfText>
<human>Is it for a charity?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>What is it for?<endOfText>
<bot>Aids.<endOfText>
<human>Oh.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, that's their problem.<endOfText>
<human>Why do you hate it so much?<endOfText>
<bot>Because it's their own fault for going to, nobody told them to go and do it, did they?<endOfText>
<human>So what, are you telling me you're gonna be a nun, and never have sex.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm not saying that, but if you're gonna do it, you might as well, you know do it properly.<endOfText>
<human>It's their fault, I don't have any sympathy for them.<endOfText>
<bot>What, what's going on?<endOfText>
<human>The aids people.<endOfText>
<bot>Who's got aids.<endOfText>

<human>Mmm<endOfText>
<bot>No, but say you did get one though <endOfText>
<human>No, no if it was from a blood transplant then I'd feel sorry for them, but if it was from you know, then I don't.<endOfText>
<bot>What if you just  got raped by a man with aids.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, well I'd feel sorry for them again, but you know, if they went and did it willingly, it's their, that's their problem.<endOfText>
<bot>Who's got aids?<endOfText>
<human>Nobody.<endOfText>
<bot>What's this about Lisa Stansfield, George Michael, whatever?<endOfText>
<human>She did this thing for the aids people.<endOfText>
<bot>So?<endOfText>

<human>All of you.<endOfText>
<bot>Number four stands  complete each one so that C is a two fold centre of rotation.<endOfText>
<human>Now that is half the diagram.<endOfText>
<bot>You have to finish the diagram, and when it's finished, C will be the centre of the two-fold rotation.<endOfText>
<human>So you simply do that, and when it pivots about C, halfway will look like that, then it'll come back what it started off at.<endOfText>
<bot>So use the other half of the diagram, and then when you've done the other half, the whole thing is a two-fold rotation about the centre of C.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, right.<endOfText>
<bot>Have you got a rubber?<endOfText>
<human>You've got my rubber.<endOfText>
<bot><endOfText>
<human>Just on the floor at the front here, would you people just pick up one or two of the things that you have in front of you and hold them up above above your heads please.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>So that everybody behind you can see what they are.<endOfText>
<bot>Turn them around in your hands.<endOfText>
<human>a minute.<endOfText>
<bot>And what are they?<endOfText>
<human>Shells.<endOfText>
<bot>Shells which have been gathered from all over  the seashore.<endOfText>
<human>Just put that to your ear  <endOfText>
<bot>Do you hear anything?<endOfText>
<human>Could you, can you hear anything?<endOfText>
<bot>You can't.<endOfText>
<human>I can hear a train go by.<endOfText>
<bot>I wonder if that was .<endOfText>
<human>Not that one<endOfText>
<bot>Can't hear anything.<endOfText>

<bot>Right <endOfText>
<human>Shh<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Well, good afternoon everybody.<endOfText>
<bot>Good afternoon.<endOfText>
<human>Well, time for some introductions.<endOfText>
<bot>My name is Chris.<endOfText>
<human>And my name is Ivan.<endOfText>
<bot>Hello.<endOfText>
<human>Some of you may know Ivan already.<endOfText>
<bot>Me.<endOfText>
<human>You do?<endOfText>
<bot>Well you are very fortunate people.<endOfText>
<human>But none of you will know my friend over here whose name is Donald.<endOfText>
<bot>Hello.<endOfText>
<human>Hello Donald.<endOfText>
<bot>Wh who I think is a friend of Noddy's.<endOfText>
<human>At any rate, he is got very big ears, and I'll tell you why.<endOfText>
<bot>Because he goes around the country with his tape recorder finding out what's going on.<endOfText>
<human>And he's very interested in collecting would you believe not just stories<endOfText>
<bot>Shells.<endOfText>
<human>Not shells, but words.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>And he's collecting lots of words to put into a very large book.<endOfText>
<bot>But he's not a spy.<endOfText>
<human>He's a gatherer and a sharer of words.<endOfText>
<bot>Just as you might be a gatherer and sharer of  stories.<endOfText>
<human>Are you, any of you, gatherers of stories?<endOfText>
<bot>Some of you are.<endOfText>
<human>Well I've got some stories that I'd like to share with you but  there's a condition.<endOfText>
<bot>If I tell you a story you'd have to agree to tell it to somebody else.<endOfText>
<human>Do you think you could do that?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>No I couldn't.<endOfText>
<bot>You couldn't?<endOfText>
<human>Well will you try and listen to these stories and see if you think there's one that you like that you might like to share?<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Alright.<endOfText>
<bot>Now the first story that I've been asked to tell specially comes not from this country  we'll just let our lads here get dressed because you, you knew that the story was gonna come from a very hot country did you?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>You took your clothes off for it.<endOfText>
<human>Well the story that I have to tell you to begin with  comes all the way from a very hot and very large continent.<endOfText>
<bot>Does anybody know any large continents where it's a very very hot place?<endOfText>
<human>Oh the centre line of the earth.<endOfText>
<bot>What's that called, the centre line of the earth?<endOfText>
<human>Mm<endOfText>
<bot>D'you know?<endOfText>
<human>I can't remember <endOfText>
<bot>The equator.<endOfText>
<human>The equator.<endOfText>
<bot>Well done.<endOfText>
<human>Is that the word you were thinking of?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Great, you took the word out of her brain.<endOfText>
<bot>Put it back later.<endOfText>
<human>A hot country which has the equator running through it.<endOfText>
<bot>The country I'm thinking of is  Africa.<endOfText>
<human>Oh that place.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Would you like to hear a story from Africa?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Alright.<endOfText>
<bot>Some of you may know this story.<endOfText>
<human>I wonder if you do?<endOfText>
<bot>It's the story all about a man who had two very nice daughters.<endOfText>
<human>An excellent choice.<endOfText>
<bot>The man's name was Mufaro .<endOfText>
<human>And he had two daughters, and their names  were Manyara and Nyasha .<endOfText>
<bot>Mufaro was a very proud father.<endOfText>
<human>Both his daughters were very beautiful and he also thought they were very wise.<endOfText>
<bot>But Manyara, when she was alone with her sister Nyasha, was not always very nice to her.<endOfText>
<human>She bullied her.<endOfText>
<bot>One day she said, I'll become the queen and then you'll have to do everything I say.<endOfText>
<human>You can be my servant.<endOfText>
<bot>Alright said Nyasha.<endOfText>
<human>If that's what's going to happen I'd be pleased to work for you.<endOfText>
<bot>But don't go around being so cross.<endOfText>
<human>Everybody likes you better than they like me  said Manyara, the elder sister.<endOfText>
<bot>That's not true, people like you as well said Nyasha.<endOfText>
<human>But don't go around being cross or you'll only make enemies for yourself.<endOfText>
<bot>Nyasha never told her father that Manyara was being nasty to her because she didn't want to upset him.<endOfText>
<human>Nyasha had one place where she was very very happy though.<endOfText>
<bot>Outside their little house  she had a little plot of land.<endOfText>
<human>And that's where she did her gardening.<endOfText>
<bot>She grew yams  she grew millet  she grew vegetables and sunflowers  and the food she shared with all the family.<endOfText>
<human>And one day  when she was working in her little garden  slithering between the vine yams there came a green snake.<endOfText>
<bot>Now in Africa  you must be careful of snakes because some of them are poisonous.<endOfText>
<human>But Nyasha knew this snake and she wasn't afraid.<endOfText>
<bot>My friend,Nyoka come to me she said.<endOfText>
<human>You are very welcome here.<endOfText>
<bot>You will keep away all the little creatures that would like to eat my vegetables.<endOfText>
<human>You can come here any time.<endOfText>
<bot>And she made a little dint in the ground which filled with some water and became a little pool for the snake to drink out.<endOfText>
<human>As she worked in her garden Nyasha, who was so happy, sang a song.<endOfText>
<bot>Not only to herself, not only to the vegetables but also to Ny<endOfText>
<human>And she pulled up the weeds and she pulled up the teasels.<endOfText>
<bot>And she  gathered the vegetables .<endOfText>
<human>And every time she sang her song the people knew that she'd be coming back .<endOfText>
<bot>And that's the reason they believed why her vegetables and her yams grew so .<endOfText>
<human>One day a messenger came from the great city  more than half a day's journey away across the river, to say that the great king had decided that he would like to have a wife.<endOfText>
<bot>And a proclamation went out to everyone who lived far and near to say that he was looking not only for a beautiful wife, but also the most worthy wife that could be found.<endOfText>
<human>And he wanted all the girls who were interested to come to the great city.<endOfText>
<bot>Manyara took her father to one side.<endOfText>
<human>Father she said, please don't send Nyasha.<endOfText>
<bot>She would be so lonely to be without you.<endOfText>
<human>It would break her heart to have to go away, even to be wife to a king.<endOfText>
<bot>I tell you what father, I'm your eldest daughter, I will go to the city, and I will become queen.<endOfText>
<human>And then you will have Nyasha to look after you.<endOfText>
<bot>My child, said Mufaro her father, that is very kind of you  but the king is the person who is going to choose.<endOfText>
<human>He is the one who'll decide who is most worthy, so you must both go.<endOfText>
<bot>And that is what was decided upon.<endOfText>
<human>Well, that night everyone went to sleep because if there was going to be a wedding everybody in the village would surely have to go.<endOfText>
<bot>And everybody knew that that would be a great journey.<endOfText>
<human>But Manyara was not happy.<endOfText>
<bot>She got up at night and she set off towards the city all by herself, travelling through the forest.<endOfText>
<human>She had never travelled alone through the forest at night before.<endOfText>
<bot>And she was a little worried.<endOfText>
<human>And she was a little afraid.<endOfText>
<bot>There were animals who lived in the forest who went out hunting only at night.<endOfText>
<human>She set off with only a little food  and she hadn't gone far when a small boy appeared right in the middle of the road.<endOfText>
<bot>Please, he said, I am so hungry.<endOfText>
<human>May I have some food.<endOfText>
<bot>Boy, she said, you're in my way.<endOfText>
<human>Get out of my way.<endOfText>
<bot>I am going to the city.<endOfText>
<human>I am going to become your queen.<endOfText>
<bot>Move.<endOfText>
<human>Now!<endOfText>
<bot>And she brushed past him and continued down the road until she came to a place where two paths crossed and there was a little clearing.<endOfText>
<human>In the middle of the clearing, on a stone, sat an old woman  who smiled at her and said hello Manyara.<endOfText>
<bot>You're very welcome.<endOfText>
<human>Take that road to the city but be careful.<endOfText>
<bot>The trees may bend and seem to laugh at you.<endOfText>
<human>Do not laugh back.<endOfText>
<bot>And when you get further towards the city, on a little rise of the land, you'll meet a man with his head under his  under his arm.<endOfText>
<human>Be careful.<endOfText>
<bot>And do not be rude to him in any way.<endOfText>
<human>Goodbye.<endOfText>
<bot>How do you know my name?<endOfText>
<human>Said Manyara.<endOfText>
<bot>And my journey is no business of yours.<endOfText>
<human>You foolish old woman.<endOfText>
<bot>And she turned and went on down the path.<endOfText>
<human>And no sooner had she done that than the trees began to wave their branches towards her.<endOfText>
<bot>And they seemed  to laugh at her.<endOfText>
<human>Ha, she said, and laughed back as though trying to be brave, trying to be strong.<endOfText>
<bot>But the trees still echoed in her ears.<endOfText>
<human>And then she came to a small rise in the land and there was a man, his head under his arm.<endOfText>
<bot>You're in my path she said.<endOfText>
<human>Get out of my way.<endOfText>
<bot>I am going to be a queen, and I do not people  speak to people who displease me.<endOfText>
<human>And she walked around him, did not look at him.<endOfText>
<bot>And she arrived in the city.<endOfText>
<human>Next morning Nyasha awoke back in her home village, the younger sister.<endOfText>
<bot>There was great commotion outside.<endOfText>
<human>People were worried.<endOfText>
<bot>People were bustling here and there.<endOfText>
<human>They were all looking for Manyara.<endOfText>
<bot>Where could she be?<endOfText>
<human>What could have happened to her.<endOfText>
<bot>Wait!<endOfText>
<human>Called someone.<endOfText>
<bot>Here is her footprint on the path leading towards the city.<endOfText>
<human>She must have left already said Mufaro.<endOfText>
<bot>We must all follow.<endOfText>
<human>And Nyasha and all her family and everybody from the village made a long long line and set off through the forest.<endOfText>
<bot>They hadn't gone far when at the side of the road they saw a small boy.<endOfText>
<human>Little boy, she said.<endOfText>
<bot>You look so hungry to me.<endOfText>
<human>Here  take this food.<endOfText>
<bot>And she offered him half of the yam that she had brought with her.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you, he said.<endOfText>
<bot>And on they travelled through the forest until they came to a place where the roads crossed and there sat an old woman resting on a stone.<endOfText>
<human>She smiled at her.<endOfText>
<bot>Old woman, she said  you look tired.<endOfText>
<human>And the woman smiled but pointed at the direction that they were to go.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you said Nyasha.<endOfText>
<human>Here  share my sunflower seeds with me.<endOfText>
<bot>And she gave her a packet of sunflower seeds.<endOfText>
<human>And on they travelled until they reached the rise in the land.<endOfText>
<bot>And Nyasha ran up to the top of the rise and saw the land and the city all below her.<endOfText>
<human>Oh father she said, this is so beautiful.<endOfText>
<bot>I've never seen such a beautiful country in my life.<endOfText>
<human>Surely there must be some wonderful things happening here.<endOfText>
<bot>Lead on said her father, and he lead the way till they came to the flowing river.<endOfText>
<human>Carefully they crossed the river and they made their way into the city.<endOfText>
<bot>But no sooner had they got to the city than they heard a loud shriek of a girl's voice.<endOfText>
<human>And Manyara came rushing out of the temple.<endOfText>
<bot>Don't come she said.<endOfText>
<human>Don't come.<endOfText>
<bot>Stay where you are.<endOfText>
<human>Oh Nyasha my sister please, do not go into the temple.<endOfText>
<bot>There is the most dreadful monster in there.<endOfText>
<human>He has five heads.<endOfText>
<bot>And it's telling you about me.<endOfText>
<human>It's telling you all about .<endOfText>
<bot>Nyasha said don't worry my sister.<endOfText>
<human>We must not be afraid.<endOfText>
<bot>We have come here to see the king and we must all go into the temple.<endOfText>
<human>Her father Mufaro comforted his eldest daughter.<endOfText>
<bot>While Nyasha bravely went into the temple and there  sitting on the throne that was made only for the chiefs there sat  not a king  not a prince<endOfText>
<human>A queen.<endOfText>
<bot>not a man<endOfText>
<human>A snake?<endOfText>
<bot>not a woman  but a small, green snake.<endOfText>
<human>Nyoka said Nyasha.<endOfText>
<bot>What are you doing here?<endOfText>
<human>And the snake spoke to her.<endOfText>
<bot>I  am not just a snake he said.<endOfText>
<human>For I am indeed  and as he spoke he changed  into a young, handsome man<endOfText>
<bot>The prince.<endOfText>
<human>with beautiful black skin  and a lovely smile on his face.<endOfText>
<bot>I am your king, he said.<endOfText>
<human>But I am also Nyoka, your snake.<endOfText>
<bot>I am also the boy who you met in the jungle.<endOfText>
<human>I am also the woman who sat at the crossroads.<endOfText>
<bot>And I know you to be beautiful and to be most worthy to be my wife.<endOfText>
<human>Will you please become my queen?<endOfText>
<bot>And Nyasha agreed.<endOfText>
<human>What a wedding there was to be.<endOfText>
<bot>The king's mother and sister took her to their hut and they prepared the finest clothes for her.<endOfText>
<human>And she baked some bread with the millet flour that she had brought from her own garden.<endOfText>
<bot>And there was a marriage.<endOfText>
<human>And there was a great feast.<endOfText>
<bot>And their father became the happiest man in the whole kingdom.<endOfText>
<human>Nyasha lived with Nyoka her husband in the palace.<endOfText>
<bot>And Manyara  worked as their servant.<endOfText>
<human>That story comes from the Shona people of South Africa.<endOfText>
<bot>And the names in the story are very important.<endOfText>
<human>The father's name was Mufaro.<endOfText>
<bot>And in the Shona language that means  happy man.<endOfText>
<human>Nyoka  in Shona means a<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>It means a snake.<endOfText>
<bot>I didn't know that you spoke African languages but you do now.<endOfText>
<human>It means a snake.<endOfText>
<bot>But what do you think the girls' names meant?<endOfText>
<human>I've written it under here so I'm not going to hold it very close.<endOfText>
<bot>What do you think the oldest girl's name meant?<endOfText>
<human>Her name was Manyara.<endOfText>
<bot>What do you think she was like?<endOfText>
<human>Their father was certainly a very happy man.<endOfText>
<bot>Shake.<endOfText>
<human>Ashamed.<endOfText>
<bot>Ashamed.<endOfText>
<human>You can read very well can't you?<endOfText>
<bot>Did you read it from here?<endOfText>
<human>Did you?<endOfText>
<bot>It doesn't matter.<endOfText>
<human>I saw some of it.<endOfText>
<bot>Well done.<endOfText>
<human>It doesn't matter.<endOfText>
<bot>Manyara means ashamed.<endOfText>
<human>Could you think of any other words that we could use to describe Manyara the eldest sister?<endOfText>
<bot>What was she like?<endOfText>
<human>Nasty.<endOfText>
<bot>Nasty, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Anything else?<endOfText>
<bot>You thought she was wicked?<endOfText>
<human>Horrid?<endOfText>
<bot>Put your hands up please and then I'll know who to hear.<endOfText>

<bot>Despicable.<endOfText>
<human>Brave.<endOfText>
<bot>Sorry?<endOfText>
<human>Brave.<endOfText>
<bot>Brave?<endOfText>
<human>You thought she was brave.<endOfText>
<bot>Why was she brave?<endOfText>
<human>she went in the woods.<endOfText>
<bot>Because she went in the jungle all alone?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Very good.<endOfText>
<human>Er horrid?<endOfText>
<bot>Horrid.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Nasty.<endOfText>
<human>Nasty.<endOfText>
<bot>Sorry?<endOfText>
<human>I forgot.<endOfText>
<bot>It doesn't matter.<endOfText>
<human>Put your hand up again when you remember again.<endOfText>
<bot>Selfish.<endOfText>
<human>Selfish.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, quite right.<endOfText>
<human>That's, you tell me one.<endOfText>
<bot>Horrid.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>A bully.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>I think she was a bit of all those things.<endOfText>
<human>Sorry?<endOfText>
<bot>herself.<endOfText>
<human>She always thought of herself.<endOfText>
<bot>Quite right.<endOfText>
<human>got no manners.<endOfText>
<bot>She had no manners.<endOfText>
<human>Yes you're all absolutely right.<endOfText>
<bot>Just sit still.<endOfText>
<human>Put your hands up if you've got something to say then we can hear.<endOfText>
<bot>Scary.<endOfText>
<human>Scary?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>She might have been if she was going at you wouldn't she?<endOfText>
<bot>And what were you going to say?<endOfText>
<human>Ill-mannered.<endOfText>
<bot>Ill-mannered.<endOfText>
<human>Quite right.<endOfText>
<bot>Silly.<endOfText>
<human>Silly.<endOfText>
<bot>And rude.<endOfText>
<human>Rude.<endOfText>
<bot>She didn't think of anyone else except herself.<endOfText>
<human>Quite right.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you very much indeed for saying that.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>And her name Manyara meant  ashamed.<endOfText>
<human>But what about the younger girl who became the queen?<endOfText>
<bot>Her name was Nyasha.<endOfText>
<human>Have you read this one?<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Have you read this one?<endOfText>
<bot>You haven't.<endOfText>
<human>Alright.<endOfText>
<bot>Well now what d'you think that name would mean?<endOfText>
<human>What was she like, Nyasha?<endOfText>
<bot>The younger girl.<endOfText>
<human>The girl who worked in the garden.<endOfText>
<bot>Nice.<endOfText>
<human>Merry.<endOfText>
<bot>Merry.<endOfText>

<bot>And try not to touch anybody else during the story.<endOfText>
<human>Alright?<endOfText>
<bot>Good.<endOfText>
<human>Now  this story is about a boy who lived with his mother.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know when this story star are you ready boys?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Can you sit nice and still please, on your bottoms, without touching anybody next to you.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know when this story started  but it certainly happened a long time ago.<endOfText>
<human>It wasn't in your time, and it wasn't in my time.<endOfText>
<bot>But it was a time when the boy and his mother, who lived in a little cottage just outside the town, had to earn their living  from growing their own vegetables and doing what they could to help other people in order to make a living.<endOfText>
<human>He liked the cottage they lived in very much indeed.<endOfText>
<bot>He liked the garden that they had very much indeed.<endOfText>
<human>He liked the path to the town.<endOfText>
<bot>He liked the countryside all around.<endOfText>
<human>And he was so happy that he said to his mother one day, mother  I want to live for ever.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh my goodness she said, I can't help you there.<endOfText>
<human>You'll need to go and get some advice  from the head wife at the end of the village.<endOfText>
<bot>And at the end of the village there lived an old woman who was very very wise and said if you want to live for ever then you must speak to the person who's the oldest person I know.<endOfText>
<human>Go and speak to the old man of the woods.<endOfText>
<bot>So up to the woods and there in the woods he heard the sound of an axe.<endOfText>
<human>Now do you know what the sound of an axe is like?<endOfText>
<bot>and trees.<endOfText>
<human>Old man he said, can you help me please?<endOfText>
<bot>And the old man stopped and put his axe down.<endOfText>
<human>I want to live for ever t said the boy.<endOfText>
<bot>Ah, said the old man.<endOfText>
<human>I'm going to live  for as long as this forest remains standing.<endOfText>
<bot>And it was a huge forest and it went for ever.<endOfText>
<human>And he put his axe into the tree again and the boy thought  he's gonna chop down all these trees soon.<endOfText>
<bot>Is there anybody else please  who's going to live for a long time?<endOfText>
<human>Ah said the old man of the woods, there's the old man of the lake.<endOfText>
<bot>And he is higher up the hill.<endOfText>
<human>So the boy climbed up the hill till he came to an enormous lake.<endOfText>
<bot>Then in the lake an old man came up from under the water and took a great scoopful of water  and drank deeply.<endOfText>
<human>The boy had never been more surprised in his life.<endOfText>
<bot>Old man, he said, do you live here?<endOfText>
<human>I do said the old man who's hair was almost down to his waist.<endOfText>
<bot>And I shall live here said the old man until I have drunk this whole lake dry.<endOfText>
<human>The lake was enormous and very very deep.<endOfText>
<bot>And the old man drank again.<endOfText>
<human>Oh said the boy, you seem so thirsty.<endOfText>
<bot>Eventually you'll have eaten and drunk all this lake.<endOfText>
<human>Is there anybody who's going to live for even longer than that?<endOfText>
<bot>Ah said the old man, there's one other person.<endOfText>
<human>It could be the old man of the mountains.<endOfText>
<bot>Go and ask him.<endOfText>
<human>And so he climbed to the mountains and there, high in the mountains, in an old stone building lived a man with hair  down below his waist.<endOfText>
<bot>Old man are you gonna live for a long time?<endOfText>
<human>I am he said.<endOfText>
<bot>I shall live here until these mountains crumble into the sea.<endOfText>
<human>Oh that's a long time said the boy.<endOfText>
<bot>Can I come and live with you and help you?<endOfText>
<human>You may, said the old man.<endOfText>
<bot>And he did.<endOfText>
<human>But after many many years, the boy suddenly got worried.<endOfText>
<bot>I want to see my mother he said.<endOfText>
<human>I want to go and see the place where I was brought up, my little house, the garden and the road to town.<endOfText>
<bot>I want to go back and visit her.<endOfText>
<human>No said the old man.<endOfText>
<bot>Don't do that.<endOfText>
<human>Stay here with me or you might be sorry.<endOfText>
<bot>The boy thought for a mom<endOfText>
<human>Me.<endOfText>

<human>Would you like to hear a story that has a harp?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Sit down on your bottoms everybody now please.<endOfText>
<bot>And we'll see what you think of this story here.<endOfText>
<human>In Scotland  by the shore there lived a fisherman who's name was Angus.<endOfText>
<bot>He'd been a fisherman all his life.<endOfText>
<human>He had his own little boat and do you know  where farmers make farrows on the land, the only mark that was left behind by Angus was the mark where he pulled his boat up on to the shore every day that the weather was not too rough.<endOfText>
<bot>The thing that he loved most of all in the whole world  was the sea.<endOfText>
<human>And he would sing to himself in his house or in his boat the song which his father had taught him many years ago.<endOfText>
<bot>He sang about his love of the sea.<endOfText>
<human>Every now and then Angus would go into the town.<endOfText>
<bot>He'd drink a dram with his friends.<endOfText>
<human>But they would say to him Angus, isn't it about time you found yourself  a wife?<endOfText>
<bot>Someone to share your life with?<endOfText>
<human>He shook his head .<endOfText>
<bot>I could never love anyone who wasn't like the sea.<endOfText>
<human>Wild  free.<endOfText>
<bot>He loved the sea so much.<endOfText>
<human>One day, it was close to midsummer, a day not unlike today.<endOfText>
<bot>Angus had been to the town and he made his way back to his cottage along the shore.<endOfText>
<human>As he went he heard the music of the sea.<endOfText>
<bot>he heard the sounds of some other voices singing on the shore.<endOfText>
<human>As he came up over the rise he thought he heard a beautiful song.<endOfText>
<bot>Some girls were dancing and singing on the beach, leaping in and out of.<endOfText>
<human>As they played and as they sang and as they danced they made no mark on the sand at all.<endOfText>
<bot>Angus was  entranced.<endOfText>
<human>He hadn't heard such a beautiful sound  he hadn't seen such a beautiful sight.<endOfText>
<bot>As he moved his way down on to the beach, he clumsily knocked the stones and the girls saw him and rushed to the rocks where they picked up not clothes, but sealskins which they wrapped around their bodies and then dived back into the sea.<endOfText>
<human>Except for one girl who ran towards the rock where Angus was leaning, not just on the rock but also on a sealskin.<endOfText>
<bot>Please, she said  that's my skin there.<endOfText>
<human>Let me have it back.<endOfText>
<bot>I must go with my people.<endOfText>
<human>I must have it.<endOfText>
<bot>Please give it back to me.<endOfText>
<human>The skin was so beautiful to touch and the girl had such a beautiful face.<endOfText>
<bot>No he said, I can't give it back to you, you're the person that I've been looking for all my life.<endOfText>
<human>Please, please come and live with me.<endOfText>
<bot>Please come and be my wife.<endOfText>
<human>I must go back to the sea, she said.<endOfText>
<bot>That's where I live.<endOfText>
<human>But Angus had hold of the skin.<endOfText>
<bot>And although she was sad, she knew that she had to go with him and she did.<endOfText>
<human>Up the shore they walked.<endOfText>
<bot>And she shuddered when her feet first touched the grass.<endOfText>
<human>Back into the cottage he showed her the way and gave her so<endOfText>
<bot>The children had heard this song many times but they were always sad that it sounded such a  lonely song.<endOfText>
<human>And while they played in the barn and while their mother sang  the girl found something behind the haystack.<endOfText>
<bot>It was soft, softer than anything she had ever touched before.<endOfText>
<human>She held it to her face and it was so beautiful.<endOfText>
<bot>She told her brothers and they too put their faces into the soft sealskin.<endOfText>
<human>Mother, mother they called, come and see what we've found.<endOfText>
<bot>And they all held out the sealskin towards her.<endOfText>
<human>Oh my children she said.<endOfText>
<bot>She dropped the bowl that she was using to the floor.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>She put the sealskin round her body and she kissed each of her children.<endOfText>
<human>And she hugged her daughter very tight.<endOfText>
<bot>Never forget me my dear she said.<endOfText>
<human>I will always help you in your future life.<endOfText>
<bot>But boys  you must all tell your father that he must look after you now.<endOfText>
<human>Goodbye.<endOfText>
<bot>And she took the skin and she ran down to the shore  and she put on the skin, dived back into the sea.<endOfText>
<human>A seal's head bobbed up from the waves and Angus was pulling on his oars, heaving the skiff back to the shore.<endOfText>
<bot>A seal called out to him, goodbye Angus, goodbye.<endOfText>
<human>Look after the children for me.<endOfText>
<bot>Farewell, farewell.<endOfText>
<human>The seal dived away and a moment later two seals appeared together in the water and swam away together.<endOfText>
<bot>The children told their father what had happened but he knew.<endOfText>
<human>But  whenever Angus and his daughter went out in the boat fishing for their lives to keep themselves fed, it seemed that a seal swam in front of the boat and lead them towards the places where the fishes were thickest in the sea in that part of the coast.<endOfText>
<bot>And they never forgot their mother.<endOfText>
<human>And they never forgot  how important the sea was in their lives.<endOfText>
<bot>Now that is the story of a seal wife.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you all for listening.<endOfText>
<human>Well.<endOfText>
<bot>That's the end of our stories.<endOfText>
<human>And somebody has got a question.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, my dad works in Scotland.<endOfText>
<human>Well I never.<endOfText>
<bot>I wonder if he's ever seen a seal?<endOfText>
<human>And there are lots of people who live in Scotland who tell stories all about the seals.<endOfText>
<bot>Have any of you ever seen a seal?<endOfText>
<human>Shh.<endOfText>
<bot>Good.<endOfText>
<human>Now one or two people have got something they want to ask.<endOfText>
<bot>So let's listen please.<endOfText>
<human>And those people who've got their hands up  boys!<endOfText>
<bot>Can you be quiet please, so that we can hear the people who want to speak.<endOfText>
<human>I think before we ask any other questions, we'll ask everybody to just have a stretch.<endOfText>
<bot>Everybody  two arms and a big stretch and everybody have a big yawn.<endOfText>
<human>Ooh <endOfText>
<bot>Ooh.<endOfText>
<human>Now  is there anybody here  who was born as an animal?<endOfText>
<bot>Everyone was.<endOfText>
<human>And so were you born as an animal?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes I was.<endOfText>
<human>What animal are you most like?<endOfText>
<bot>A dinosaur.<endOfText>
<human>A dinosaur.<endOfText>
<bot>That's very interesting.<endOfText>
<human>I'm a monkey.<endOfText>
<bot>Sorry?<endOfText>
<human>A human, you're a human being?<endOfText>
<bot>Alright.<endOfText>
<human>I just wanted to make sure .<endOfText>
<bot>Right so  everybody, listen please.<endOfText>
<human>Boys.<endOfText>
<bot>Donald has still got his  microphone here and he wants to hear what everybody's got to say.<endOfText>
<human>And if we all talk at the same time, he can't hear anything.<endOfText>
<bot>He's come a very long way to see what you've got to say as well as hear the stories.<endOfText>
<human>Now what did you want to say at the back?<endOfText>
<bot>Cla some of class seven enjoyed the story that much  story about seals before we came in.<endOfText>
<human>You've heard a story about seals before?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>This afternoon we had a story called the seal king wasn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>It was all about  <endOfText>
<human>Really.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>It wasn't the same story but it was a story about seals.<endOfText>
<bot>What a coincidence.<endOfText>
<human>What a strange coincidence wasn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh absolutely.<endOfText>
<human>And what happened in your seal story?<endOfText>
<bot>I'm doing some listening over here.<endOfText>
<human>A fisherman caught a seal.<endOfText>
<bot>A king seal out of the sea.<endOfText>
<human>A king seal?<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>And what happened to the seal?<endOfText>
<bot>And erm <endOfText>
<human>Shh shh shh.<endOfText>
<bot>We're listening.<endOfText>
<human>That's a very good story.<endOfText>
<bot>And those stories are very very old.<endOfText>
<human>And for many many years nobody wrote those stories down at all.<endOfText>
<bot>So the fact that you've heard those seal stories, two different ones, is very important.<endOfText>
<human>Particularly if you've written them down.<endOfText>
<bot>You're not supposed to still be yawning.<endOfText>
<human>Alright  now I just wonder if it might be worthwhile just some people going back to the classroom now or some stay or?<endOfText>
<bot>children  class .<endOfText>
<human>Children in class  <endOfText>
<bot>will you sit down for two more minutes.<endOfText>
<human>all those people going now  music.<endOfText>

<human>Now, I've got some questions that I'd like to ask you.<endOfText>
<bot>Everybody sitting on the floor please.<endOfText>
<human>Everybody sitting on the floor.<endOfText>
<bot>That's  <endOfText>
<human>I've got one or two questions I'd like to ask you  and I wonder what your reply is gonna be.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, in order for Donald to be able to hear the replies as well, we must only have one person talking at a time.<endOfText>
<human>I want you just to close your eyes for one minute everybody please.<endOfText>
<bot>And I want you to think about the sound that you, not touching anybody!<endOfText>
<human>Sit down on your bottom and close your eyes please!<endOfText>
<bot>Everybody else can do it except for you.<endOfText>
<human>Now, close your eyes please very carefully.<endOfText>
<bot>I want you to think  not just about the story of the seal wife  no, on your bottom  eyes closed.<endOfText>
<human>I want you to think about the sounds that you heard.<endOfText>
<bot>The sounds that Angus heard and the sounds that his wife heard  and the songs that they sung.<endOfText>
<human>Now  how could you describe those sounds?<endOfText>
<bot>What did they sound like to you?<endOfText>
<human>When you've got an idea or something to say, put your hand in the air please.<endOfText>
<bot>What did those sounds  sound like?<endOfText>
<human>Alright.<endOfText>
<bot>Open your eyes everybody.<endOfText>
<human>What could those sounds sound like to you?<endOfText>
<bot>Gentle.<endOfText>
<human>Gentle.<endOfText>
<bot>The song sounded beautiful and lonely.<endOfText>
<human>Beautiful and lonely the song.<endOfText>
<bot>Soft.<endOfText>
<human>Soft.<endOfText>
<bot>forgotten.<endOfText>
<human>Doesn't matter.<endOfText>
<bot>Wavy.<endOfText>
<human>Wavy?<endOfText>

<human>What were you gonna say?<endOfText>
<bot>Can't remember.<endOfText>
<human>Quite right, it was very wavy wasn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>That's a very good word to use, that one.<endOfText>
<human>Musical .<endOfText>
<bot>Musical.<endOfText>
<human>Now I want you to think about what sort of  what sort of thing you mean by musical because we know it was musical.<endOfText>
<bot>But what did it feel like?<endOfText>
<human>Somebody said wavy, and that was a shape  almost.<endOfText>
<bot>There was a feel to that as well because it was moving a lot wasn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Hands up first please.<endOfText>
<bot>It sounded like the sea.<endOfText>
<human>Like the sea.<endOfText>
<bot>And what does the sea sound like to you?<endOfText>
<human>I know.<endOfText>
<bot>I know.<endOfText>
<human>Shh shh.<endOfText>
<bot>Everybody might think something different.<endOfText>
<human>Is it a gentle sound or a fierce sound?<endOfText>
<bot>A soft sound.<endOfText>
<human>A soft sound.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>What were you gonna say?<endOfText>
<bot>A kind sound.<endOfText>

<bot>We just want to say thank you very much to all of you for coming and listening.<endOfText>
<human>But there's one thing that you have to remember.<endOfText>
<bot>I said at the beginning that you were gonna come and listen to our stories  you also had to<endOfText>
<human>tell other people the stories as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, next time you're babysitting you can tell the baby.<endOfText>
<human>So we've only got one thing more to do for you.<endOfText>
<bot>Everybody.<endOfText>
<human>We've only got one thing more that we can give to you and that's a good clap to show you how much we've appreciated you listening.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you very much indeed.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you  <endOfText>
<bot>Thank you.<endOfText>
<human>Alright.<endOfText>
<bot>And Donald's gonna go and take away all those words and he's gonna put them all into a dictionary all by himself.<endOfText>
<human>Right now everybody, without making any other sound and leaving the shelves just were they are, can you all stand up.<endOfText>
<bot>Don't move just stand up.<endOfText>
<human><endOfText>
<bot>Who told you the facts of life?<endOfText>
<human>Did they tell you the truth?<endOfText>
<bot>Or are you still working it out for yourself?<endOfText>
<human>Sex education used to be whispered, sniggered and gossiped about, today, we're more enlightened, or are we?<endOfText>
<bot>Exactly what should be taught, to whom, by whom, and when still provokes heated debate.<endOfText>
<human>So, we thought we'd find out what young people want to know, and what they think of the education they've had.<endOfText>
<bot>After all, this hundred young women have all benefited from the open, healthy, society that's developed over the last few decades, or have they?<endOfText>
<human>Let's start with a question.<endOfText>
<bot>Have you had formal sex education?<endOfText>
<human>Button one for yes, and button two for no.<endOfText>
<bot>And in this hundred, amazingly, twenty two people say no!<endOfText>
<human>Seventy eight said yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's start with the yes's,wha what was it, the formal sex education, you seventy eight?<endOfText>
<human>What have you had  and where?<endOfText>
<bot>Sex in, section six in a biology class  about plants <endOfText>
<human>flowers and that <endOfText>
<bot>That <endOfText>
<human>was it!<endOfText>
<bot>That was it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Plants and flowers?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Didn't you even got on to frogs and rabbits?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Flowers.<endOfText>
<human>What about so <endOfText>
<bot>And that's all anybody got was section six, this dreaded section six which we were taught at the end of the year!<endOfText>
<human>And that's all anybody got in my school.<endOfText>
<bot>How about humans?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>No, just about plants !<endOfText>
<human>Seriously?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Beside you.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, we had erm  a class, an actual sex education class, every week for a year.<endOfText>
<human>Our biology teacher took it, but it was  it was also so , it was the facts about  erm  sex, abortion  contraception, but we also, also talked about the emotional side of things.<endOfText>
<bot>So, would you say it was quite good?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, it was quite.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, of course there were things that were  missed out I suppose, but  also, I suppose, we were quite young, so it may have quite embarrassing and we didn't want talk about certain things.<endOfText>
<human>Was that the case or <endOfText>
<bot>Round about twelve or thirteen, I suppose they kind of <endOfText>
<human>Do you think you were too young to talk about the  th the emotional side <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>of it?<endOfText>
<bot>Probably because most of us weren't really, well, quite a few of us anyway weren't thinking about sex at that time, so I suppose it was kind of you know, you just started <endOfText>
<human>your periods and everything and you<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>you're not exactly thinking about sex.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, so two not absolutely satisfactory er  experiences there.<endOfText>
<human>Has any ,do has anybody had formal sex education of those seventy eight who that it was very we , it was well taught, that it was good?<endOfText>
<bot>And you got a  yes?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, sex education at school was <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>similar to  well the girl mentioned earlier on, that, since then  I've had  within the last couple of years<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>erm, I do voluntary work for the Brook Advisory, er through the peer educators and  that has been very  erm beneficial for  for myself and for the work  that er, we do with <endOfText>
<bot>What <endOfText>
<human>youths.<endOfText>
<bot>Wha what what is that?<endOfText>
<human>I mean te tell me, tell us more about that.<endOfText>
<bot>Well we go to  youth clubs or schools  and, talk to  youths from  eight to eighteen about contraception  erm  drugs  and other topics of concern, abortion, homophobia, things like that.<endOfText>
<human>What do you think of that?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean I I, I don't know, what do yo , what do you think sex education should be?<endOfText>
<human>Is it, is it important at all?<endOfText>
<bot>It wasn't, it wasn't much of a subject when I was young, is it, is it a necessary part of the school curriculum?<endOfText>
<human>Is it something that should be taught at home?<endOfText>
<bot>What do you think?<endOfText>
<human>I mean,wha , those of you who have children wha , what do you, what do you hope for them?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes?<endOfText>
<human>I think it's very important.<endOfText>
<bot>It's important people know the real facts about it instead a lot of this playground chatter.<endOfText>
<human>I also think it's important that  people have this sort of  emotional side of it taught to them as well, you're often taught like the straight, you know, the wee sperm and the wee egg come together and you get a baby, but you don't, not taught about the emotional side of it a lot <endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>of the time, I think that's really important.<endOfText>
<bot>Is it possible to teach that.<endOfText>
<human>Yes I think it is.<endOfText>
<bot>I think it should be done a lot younger as well.<endOfText>
<human>Primary age?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, primary I think, roundabout primary four or five, cos that's when they start talking about it, and that's where you start getting all the  the wrong things told to you in the playground, I mean I know that's what happened to me.<endOfText>
<human>Really?<endOfText>
<bot>So I mean, so wha , when, I mean how old when you found out, and who told you?<endOfText>
<human>Oh!<endOfText>
<bot>I was about, I dunno  about primary four age and someone in the playground, I think it was  can't remember exactly what I was told, obviously, but it was  something silly, you know, like <endOfText>
<human>really dirty and everything which <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>it isn't.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>It's not a  dirty thing .<endOfText>
<bot>Yep.<endOfText>
<human>Yes?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes?<endOfText>
<human>There.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, erm , I just want to say how can a four or five year old  er, understand the concepts and  the emotions involved in sexual  relationships?<endOfText>
<human>Well they don't have to know <endOfText>
<bot>If it's just erm <endOfText>
<human>exactly what it is, but th we should be told that it's not a dirty thing, it's not a bad thing.<endOfText>
<bot>You know what I mean?<endOfText>
<human>At th , a lot of people are just told that it's so dirty, which is isn't  and I <endOfText>
<bot>Mm mm.<endOfText>
<human>just think  should, you should get across that it isn't dirty.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>Isn't it, but you don't you think that's more so for females than it is for males, the fact that it is such a dirty thing that, that applies more to females than it does, to males?<endOfText>
<bot>I think it applies to both sexes.<endOfText>
<human>Can you avoid the kind of dirty, sniggering aspect though?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, is it possible to to, to have a holy, healthy attitude to, to sex?<endOfText>
<human>I think erm  we could have a much healthier aspect to it if it was taught to u in a healthier way, I mean <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>so many of the teachers that teach it are far too embarrassed to broach the  subject sensibly, you know, and they just pass it on  and so kids don't treat it sensibly.<endOfText>
<bot>I feel we're expecting <endOfText>
<human>But don't you <endOfText>
<bot>an awful lot from teachers, you know, we're just expecting that they know everything about sex education.<endOfText>
<human>I feel that teachers must be educated, if they can education us.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Any other views?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes?<endOfText>
<human>That last point, you were saying about, you know giggling and laughing about it, I think, that that's a part of it, I mean sex can be fun<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>so what's wrong with  er it shouldn't be dealt with in a like a really serious way, it should be fun for everybody and what's wrong with having a laugh about it as well?<endOfText>
<bot>What about home?<endOfText>
<human>I mean er, I wonder in fact I mi I might as you this question, have you discussed er sex with your parents?<endOfText>
<bot>Button one for yes, and button two for no.<endOfText>
<human>And, in this hundred  sixty one, yes  thirty nine, no.<endOfText>
<bot>Does, do those votes surprise you?<endOfText>
<human>Do you think er  yes?<endOfText>
<bot>I think that everyone seems to pass the buck, I mean  the parents think, oh they'll learn it at school and the teachers think, oh co they should be learning it from their parents, and yo , you never learn it from anyone just from your friends.<endOfText>
<human>Yes?<endOfText>
<bot>I think erm sexuality begins with sensuality  and therefore it should begin in the home, and it should be exaggerated at school, I mean, it should helped but fundamentally it's with your parents or guardians whoever, who should begin it.<endOfText>
<human>Is that your experience?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I mean I'm I'm very lucky because my parents are very liberal, and I mean they discussed sex with me quite early on and I've never had a problem discussing it with them.<endOfText>
<human>But that's not the case with everyone  er I mean un unfortunately I wish it was.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, that i , is precisely, it isn't the case with everyone, I mean, I think that what the girl was saying up there about the groups going round, it's a great idea!<endOfText>
<bot>It was the same in the biology, biology teacher at our school, it was very hush hush and very embarrassed.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>I think if you got maybe a  twenty five year old who came to your school for a week  and  got you in a small group  and talked about it, it would be great on a one to one basis.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm,a , my mother didn't speak to me about sex until I was pregnant!<endOfText>
<human>You know which  I I i wa , I wasn't totally embarrassed about it but I just we , I think she was, you know, that sort of generation and that era, which I hope with my son it will be totally different, like  come to me and say anything you like, you know?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I'm a liberal parent.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, there's probably two points I would want to say, one is that, what about the children and young people tha that refuse to go to school?<endOfText>
<bot>And where's the education for them?<endOfText>
<human>I think the other one, about the woman across there said about, should start at home with sensuality and stuff and  many of the young women that I work wi , I've  I've heard very negative experiences of sex<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>through sexual abuse, and I think we spend a lot of our time, and I think even for teachers, we spend a lot of our time undoing a lot of the damage of helping young people, undo a lot of damage that's done by sex.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think  they view it as a dead happy, enjoyable, fun thing and it's something that  that they do if you say, is really serious and <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>something that is nay  er positive for them.<endOfText>
<human>It doesn't matter, I mean, where or whom you've been told by, as long as you've been told  you can take precautions later in life from sexual diseases and  and getting yourself pregnant.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>What comes into sex education?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean,th tha tha that's interesting what you said, because you said how to avoid sexual diseases and to er  avoid getting pregnant, are those the basics of sex education  or or what more would put onto the list of things that you would teach?<endOfText>
<human>Yes?<endOfText>
<bot>I think when somebody teaches it they teach it in the premise that everybody they're talking to is heterosexual.<endOfText>
<human>What about people that are homosexual?<endOfText>
<bot>What about like  contraception should be integral part of it, and abortion and the options open to you, but I think it's very important that we are taught it, we're taught it in a heterosexual basis, and that's just not the case, and that just alienates people any more, really more from a very early age.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm still doing sex education at schools and look like it's changing a lot cos there's a lot more to do there, a lot more emphasis on Aids, that's why they've got to ki , teach kids in primary school, we've got to prevent them from getting a disease.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>I was gonna say about sex education that when I was learning at school, it's also very male dominated erm  it was, I mean you were talking about erm  what's i li , the differences between males and females learning about sex education and wha , and we were learnt about the the man having pleasure, we were taught about the man having the erection and  the man having the orgasm, I mean, we didn't even know what a clitoris was!<endOfText>
<human>Th I mean, I've never even heard of the term clitoris, and a friend of mine thought her clitoris was actually her epiglottis, I mean it  just got  <endOfText>
<bot>the whole the thing just got completely confused.<endOfText>
<human>And that's when<endOfText>
<bot>But do you think it's appropriate to teach sex in that kind of detail  to to school children?<endOfText>
<human>Erm<endOfText>
<bot>To tau , to teach pe , school children about sexual pleasure for instance, er er er rather than the biological facts of reproduction?<endOfText>
<human>I think it's part and parcel of sex, and so, yes, I do think it is very important and I think it is  a process that does have to, have to be started very young, and is on-going throughout our education.<endOfText>
<bot>Now I would guess that goes further that most school curricular.<endOfText>
<human>I mean has anyone learnt about sexual pleasure, at er, at school?<endOfText>
<bot>Or about er, the male and female orgasms?<endOfText>
<human>Well obviously you learn about the male orgasm  because that's what  creates a baby but  I think she was right, the female  orgasm is never mentioned  but it's there<endOfText>
<bot>or should be.<endOfText>
<human>Ha!<endOfText>
<bot>Yep?<endOfText>
<human>I think it's very important that er  females should be taught that it's pleasurable for them as well, you <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>haven't just to literally lie back there and the man says what happens, when it happens, and they're to do as they're told sort of thing because that obviously develops sexual abuse, women being raped, and attitudes that lead towards these things.<endOfText>
<bot>It's very important you're taught that, er  such feelings as respect, love, emotions all come into this  and a woman has a right to say no, if she doesn't <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>want this, and it's not up to a man to decide what happens.<endOfText>
<human>But it seems that that isn't what's being taught, and therefore,in information about that comes, well either via your own experience or talking with friends or reading womens' magazines or  I mean whe , where do we actually get our education from?<endOfText>
<bot>Learn through <endOfText>
<human>Like you said <endOfText>
<bot>more through magazines than I did at school, because in school I was taught nothing about pleasure, it was all very biological with a diagram of the male and the female, exactly what happened, there was nothing about  er, sexually transmitted diseases, pleasure or abortion, contraception, nothing  mentioned, only the mere basics.<endOfText>
<human>Now, normally in this programme when we talk about womens' magazines, people are inveighing against them because they carry various advertisements that they find offensive or exploitative, but are women's magazines actually erm  performing quite a useful job by filling in the gaps that that schools and parents are  are failing to address?<endOfText>
<bot>What do you think?<endOfText>
<human>Any, yes?<endOfText>
<bot>I think they're a very dangerous mode of education because they provide a very stereo-typed image of everything, everybody that they're talking about if they're talking about sex, they presume to be able bodied, they're presumed to be white generally, they're presumed to be heterosexual, if they're talking about homosexual then, it's definitely male  lesbians <endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>never come into it.<endOfText>
<human>I'm sorry, but I think these must be in the wrong magazines!<endOfText>
<bot>The magazines that are out today are very informative of where you can get the addresses of places to go, they give both sides of homosexuality  you know, male and female as far I've seen, and definitely in the past two years or so.<endOfText>
<human>Now, is that our best hope, is is is is the commercial provision of womens' magazine is the best hope we have for getting in, in any information we want?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, in an ideal world what wha what agenda would you draw up?<endOfText>
<human>I don't think it's necessarily about teaching  er  children primarily about sex or about sexual pleasure, I think it's all, initially, about personal hygiene and then  developing that into how they can make their life safer for themself , or giving them choices to say, well I can choose to become pregnant  or not to become pregnant  and, I think it's more about choices rather than saying  orgasms and  erm  sexual pleasure, or <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>telling youngsters, when they can't actually understand the concept of having sex.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Yes?<endOfText>
<bot>I think if erm, perhaps if television did something more about it you'd be able to  erm, home in on the people who are excluded, erm, people who are outside  school, school situations, people <endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>who don't actually go to school.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, looking at certain problems, a lot of erm  young women who get pregnant don't get pregnant at school, they get pregnant as soon as they leave school.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, in say, an area, a a deprived area it's very often hard for women to get access to information.<endOfText>
<bot>Basically, there's a comparison of figures that erm  one pregnancy in every two hundred and fifty six in Morningside is to women under twenty, yet one in four in, in an area like Craigmiller is to women under twenty so there's a big sort of  difference.<endOfText>
<human>And you need to access, you need to key in to certain areas as well, so television could be the ideal way to do that.<endOfText>
<bot>But it's not doing it at the moment, although there's<endOfText>
<human>Well  no it certainly doesn't seem to be with, one in four girls getting pregnant.<endOfText>
<bot>Well people generally complain about sex on television  so, the way it's being presented.<endOfText>
<human>Up there.<endOfText>
<bot>You often find that erm  television with sex and everything, they always put it on after a certain time for children go to bed.<endOfText>
<human>It's like, Aids and that  like the glue sniffing advert, for instance, put on  fo when the children go to bed, but they should be able to see that,sho , they should be able to see  look, well that's putting a message across to me as well , not just the parents, to me, I'm the one that's involved and I think that  if  well maybe the  the producers would maybe  or the people that  do television would maybe put i to  say, seven o'clock or that, where  young children primary school age can actually sit and watch it.<endOfText>
<bot>I think if you got taught sex education in maybe, smaller groups, you know erm  if they could with individual teachers<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>er they, you know, were people that you trust and  that you could ask questions that you wouldn't be embarrassed<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>that'd help a lot.<endOfText>
<human>Yes?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, I think if they were more honest and open, I mean  like parents and schools and stuff, it wouldn't be so difficult for people to talk about it, and  there wouldn't be as many, the jokes about it.<endOfText>
<human>If if everybody spoke about, the communication was better  then  it'd be a lot easier for people that deal with it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah?<endOfText>
<human>Beside you.<endOfText>
<bot>I think it's just our culture as well <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>that influences our  opinions on it, you know.<endOfText>
<human>And, I think it's really important that  sex education in schools should be taught by somebody that the pupils can relate to.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos I know when I was at school we actually got our sex education in fourth year, and it was by a visiting lecturer, it was this wee old man about fifty, he said basically, this is a male body, this is a female body, nothing about sexuality, orgasms anything!<endOfText>
<human>It was terrible!<endOfText>
<bot>So I <endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>think that's really important.<endOfText>
<human>I'm going back to the thing about erm and boys and <endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>today, in school we had a two members of a family planning association and er, we were in group  and we actually had  the guys in our class, they're seventeen, maybe eighteen  sitting laughing and sniggering between themselves!<endOfText>
<bot>And that's at that age!<endOfText>
<human>And I would say, in our school  we've had the Aids team in and we've talked quite a lot about sex education  and they're still sniggering!<endOfText>
<bot>They're still  having their jokes between <endOfText>
<human>Mm mm.<endOfText>
<bot>themselves <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>and whatever.<endOfText>
<human>I don't think we're ever gonna get away from that.<endOfText>
<bot>Why do you think that is?<endOfText>
<human>It's  I don't know what it was, er  they hardly, we were having a discussion with the doctor, erm  none of them would put forward their opinions or their views or what they thought<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>we're talking about abortion, who's responsibility it was, erm  they just  were nay prepared to put forward their opinions.<endOfText>
<bot>Is that your common experience that that young men aren't aren't really up to this?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah?<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>I work for the same pre project as Verity and I worked with  five, fifteen, sixteen year old boys, just yesterday, and they were one of the best groups I'd ever worked with because <endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>they were interested.<endOfText>
<bot>And it was contraception, which as you all know, is predominantly female  and they were  interested like, what their partners would use, what they will use  and, it was wonderful!<endOfText>
<human>I couldn't believe  because I always thought that it was the guys that sniggered, the guys that weren't interested <endOfText>
<bot>Mm mm.<endOfText>
<human>and through past experience it is changing.<endOfText>
<bot>Was it a mixed group or er<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>No, we had five sa , boys  no mixed.<endOfText>
<human>Do you think ma , do you think maybe that's, that's one of the answers, to separate the sexes for, for these discussions or<endOfText>
<bot>No, I think maybe if the girls had been in they might have been a bit shier and felt  you know, oh we have to act  you know, the lads.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>You know, so maybe  but <endOfText>
<human>Yes?<endOfText>
<bot>I think the guys snigger because they're covering up for their embarrassment  that's <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>their way of breaking the ice and showing that  they just, they, that's way of coping with it.<endOfText>
<human>I think that they may be  frightened to speak up and that  they're scared that  if they say something  that they don't know, like a lot of them don't know the facts, like today, in the same class as Janine across there, some of them didn't know even the very  the pro , progression of the male pill or anything like that, and they did learn a few things but  a again they never spoke up  and they weren't interested, but I <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>think it was because of embarrassment.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah?<endOfText>
<human>Up there.<endOfText>
<bot>I think, you know, I think in answer to the embarrassment question, I think although it is about that  erm, people are nay do, people wi on just are nay prepared to commit with information, I think, in areas there's a wealth of information and experience <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>and people who are prepared to discuss the issue but they just don't come out the door  to where  erm, the people are that need the information.<endOfText>
<human>I <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>think there has to be a  er family planning centres have to more on the street, I think family planning  clinics have got the people there who are able to go out on the street.<endOfText>
<bot>I think the other issue is that  we have to be defending  erm, the family planning centres that are being closed down, like the forty or fifty in Glasgow, the thirteen in  er Edinburgh,th the east of Scotland<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>and I think that is just gonna create  you know, a bigger ignorance amongst young people  erm, you know a bigger ignorance about contraception itself <endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>which again, there is nay a hundred percent safe contraception <endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>to prevent pregnancy, or any other disease for that matter.<endOfText>
<human>And I think that's something <endOfText>
<bot>that we're gonna have to  start er  defending, you know, because we  er er, we, we have got a wealth of experience and information it just has to be shared.<endOfText>
<human>You're not suggesting pregnancy's a disease there  are you?<endOfText>
<bot>For some of us, aye, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>A <endOfText>
<bot>It is a disease!<endOfText>
<human>In Holland  er, young teenagers are taught in school how to  how to use condoms, now I don't know whether that's taught in schools or, or classes in Scotland,i is it?<endOfText>
<bot>It should be!<endOfText>
<human>Has anyone, I mean has anyone had that experience?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes?<endOfText>
<human>Well I got a video  and, like, that's all we got a few videos and the video showed you how to use a condom, and that was it.<endOfText>
<bot>And that was at school?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But that's probably more than a lot of people did, and everyone's being urged to use condoms, but how many people are actually  given any instruction on how to use them?<endOfText>
<human>Yes?<endOfText>
<bot>Well  yesterday we actually went to  to a school and  you show them how to use with a condom demonstrator and  allow them to touch the condoms, and in youth clubs you allow them to do  practically anything with them, as long as they're returned, they can blow them up, or they can<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>shoot them across the room or whatever.<endOfText>
<human>But I think all the silliness is all part of  actually adjusting to  the condom, and something to do with the embarrassment  that because they don't know enough about it  they, they don't want to be  er, seen to be silly<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>so, they put up a front, and <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I think it's all part of it, that they will be silly initially, but they'll som , soon co , er come to realize that it's  sensible.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>In a, in our school we were shown by our guidance teacher how to put a condom  and he used a banana<endOfText>
<bot>so, that just shows you that  that can happen.<endOfText>
<human>And we  it was fourth year when we done it and  we'd never been shown anything like that and it was interesting because  it's the sort of fact that you  you never really think about <endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>until yo you're actually gonna do it, sort of thing  which I thought it was interesting.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you think er, as young women you have a right, on behalf perhaps, of women ten years younger than you, to suggest changes in what's happening now?<endOfText>
<human>You're obviously in, and  the other people in the, in the Brook are er  advisory peer groups, are are doing work, people are suggesting, they they they think that should be extended, what more might be done?<endOfText>
<bot>Audrey?<endOfText>
<human>I think it erm  it possibly could be politicized and actually funded.<endOfText>
<bot>I was wondering if erm  the girl at the back was actually a volunteer or if she was in fact, paid for her work?<endOfText>
<human>Because I I do know of of various different groups who are working in this field as volunteers, there's no money  behind them there, and I mean  i i it should be a priority, it should be given that kind of priority where <endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>funds are made for it.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>Voluntary.<endOfText>
<bot>It is voluntary.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, yes?<endOfText>
<human>Can I just say that, about the age thing again, erm, I also do, with the Brook Peer Group <endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>and erm  I went to a youth club and I  I was speaking to eight year olds  and they're asking about condoms cos they've seen them in the street, so it's obviously  they're wanting to find out about it cos it's everywhere around them  even, doesn't matter what age.<endOfText>
<bot>And what will you tell an eight year old?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, well we let them  and again we brought out the demonstrator and we let them touch condoms  erm  do anything they wanted with them as long as we got them back.<endOfText>
<bot>But they're fi , they're going to find about it cos it's  everywhere.<endOfText>
<human>I think one of the main points is not so much the way it's taught but who teaches it.<endOfText>
<bot>Because, going back to the point earlier on, erm, when I was taught I say, it was a local nurse from th er, the clinic that taught us  I mean I've nothi , nothing against elder women in their fifties and whatever, but I mean, there again, one, it shouldn't always be females who teach about sex, it should be males, and it should be younger people to relate <endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>to, because, one of the main points about the embarrassing er aspect, mainly boys sniggering and giggling, whatever, maybe some girls do, but it's mainly  er, males, I think a point to be made there is, it is a well known fact that boys took longer to mature emotionally than girls  and I think if it was a guy  a younger guy, maybe in his late twenties, early thirties teaching it, and if he had the sort of guts to turn round and the bravery to say  look son, what is it you're laughing at, what's so funny?<endOfText>
<human>I mean <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>you're seventeen years old, if you're old enough to have sex surely you're old enough to  you know, think about it in a mature way.<endOfText>
<bot>And it would ta , take someone like that just to make them think, yeah, well, you know what is so funny in  get rid of this sort of stigma about boys being immature.<endOfText>
<human>I also work for the peer group  for the Brook<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>and er, we have two boys that do it with us as well and when they come out to youth clubs with us  the girls and the boys that we go and speak to  love having a male there <endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>that they can go and  the boys have a good laugh with them, and the girls have a good laugh as well and it seems to work.<endOfText>
<bot>A , any concluding thoughts on er  on the future for sex education in Scotland?<endOfText>
<human>I'd agree that it's important <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>that people can  make their o , they have a balanced education which allows them then to make their own choices about, that  things aren't over, I mean if we've lived in a patriarchal society in which men are in power and that kin , and male sexuality maybe has come through more in sex education, those have been the issues that have been  co ,ha have been given more importance and female issues have maybe been neglected a little bit  and now erm, with Aids as a problem  we don't want to turn out and suddenly become really homo homophobic or really, you know, right condoms, condoms, it has to be  you know, you need to kind of keep the balance so that people  are given the information and then have the freedom to make the choice themselves.<endOfText>
<bot>I think they should get rid of the stigma in condoms, cos what frightens me is that  in about ten years time my daughter will come and maybe ask if she can go on the pill and at least I can tell her  no, use a condom there's less chance of  sexually transmitted diseases, but it's my sons  they won't come and ask.<endOfText>
<human>Yes?<endOfText>
<bot>I think the problem is, that  at the moment sex education is so arbitrary and it varies from school to school and from house to house  I think they have to make it like a core part of the curriculum, make it compulsory and make it uniform throughout the country, so everybody's getting the same education, the same quality  I think that'll help.<endOfText>
<human>Lots of good ideas.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you very much for discussing this and opening up watch, what is, too often a  a a taboo area.<endOfText>
<human>I hope you found it interesting?<endOfText>
<bot>I have.<endOfText>
<human>And thanks for joining us.<endOfText>
<bot>Goodbye.<endOfText>
<human><endOfText>
<bot>There is concern about funding for the Children Act and it's too important to start scoring political points, whether there's a General Election or not t and I must admit I was off, I was off ill, off work during the week of the Tory Party Conference.<endOfText>
<human>It was actually something that happened before the Tory Party Conference but it didn't, it didn't actually help me recover<endOfText>
<bot>and nearly every day, nearly every speaker actually attacked Local Government in some way.<endOfText>
<human>What the Children, what the Children Act does at least recognise in the Conservative Government passing the Children Act is the importance of Local Government.<endOfText>
<bot>These are very important services and they are placed, just like care in the community will be, when it eventually is put into practice.<endOfText>
<human>They will actually  responsibility of Local Government and er we've tried to put in here something that even Conservative Councillors could support, even though it's attacking Conservative Ministers, cos they must actually believe in Local Government to actually serve on Local Government, one would think, but er, but th the problems of under-funding are th could be very serious.<endOfText>
<bot>During the summer we had serious problems, we had a report on children homes which erm which y'know which pointed out a few things y'know that  hadn't been doing well, mainly, mainly in defence of erm because they did put in a lot of effort into fostering y'know and the children homes y'know need, as Councillor  would y'know will, they did a very good job actually representing  at the time.<endOfText>
<human>Yet I listen to the television and Virginia Bottomley with th within er hours of the r the news breaking in  trying to make political capital out of, threatening to come to  to inspect inspected  children homes.<endOfText>
<bot>Clearly that's what worries me about this Government's implementation of the Children Act.<endOfText>
<human>I mean our motion you can do with it what you will but like I say we have actually aimed to actually get something which recognises all party support for the Children Act and recognises concern about the funding.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you.<endOfText>
<human>Councillor  <endOfText>
<bot>D d I've put I've not gone too political on this and you're running me down already I don't know.<endOfText>
<human>There is, as has been said, all party support for the Children Act and it is nice to see the Labour Party agreeing with Conservative legislation, as with the care in the community, asking us to rush our legislation, so it makes a change for us to be united on something.<endOfText>
<bot>Probably the Act the Act will work as a framework through which our children's futures and their needs will be of paramount importance in all our decision making.<endOfText>
<human>One of the key points of the Children Act being that gone are the days of parents' rights.<endOfText>
<bot>The Children Act clearly replaces this with parents' responsibilities.<endOfText>
<human>I think that's one of the things that we're we're all pretty much in agreement on.<endOfText>
<bot>What about the responsibilities of the Councillors to the children in our care?<endOfText>
<human>We all know the grave problems in some of our children's homes but we can't run away with the fact that er they're unique to  or the problems don't exist elsewhere because we all know they do.<endOfText>
<bot>It's nothing new, it's an age old thing.<endOfText>
<human>Speaking to one of the workers in one of the  children's homes, said do you think that child prostitution in the children's homes is something new because it's on the front of the T and A?<endOfText>
<bot>I've worked in these homes for fifteen years and it was going on when I first started there.<endOfText>
<human>So, it's it's just a problem that's come to the surface that obviously needs addressing.<endOfText>
<bot>As custodians of the children we've a legal duty to take care of thes of the children that we in our care.<endOfText>
<human>One of the major problems for us, whichever Party's in in control, and I think if Councillor  had gone to the press after this report was done and, rather than trying to score points and saying it's all because it's lack of Government cash, if he'd appli if he'd said, let's all get together on this, let's try and solve the problem, the problem's been going on indefinitely, let's try and s , he might have gained more credibility.<endOfText>
<bot>But of course he came out with his usual dry diatribe of er not enough Government cash.<endOfText>
<human>The major problem being, if one of our children gets out of hand, one our own children, we've got our own ways of dealing with it.<endOfText>
<bot>Some parents still give their kids a clip round the ear, some of em send the children to their room or whatever, but when the children are in care you can't do any of these things because if you lock the child in the room, if the child gets sent to the room, you're accused of pindown when there's a report done.<endOfText>
<human>You can't physically restrain the children.<endOfText>
<bot>So the problem is, if your child wants to go, if one of our children wanted to go at midnight, I'm fairly sure that everybody in this Council Chamber would have quite a reasonable way of er of retaining that child in the home but of course we've all heard the stories of what happens when the unruly children in the children's homes want to go out at midnight and I do think we we have a problem because with the  report and the new legislation, we're in the situation where there's plenty of advice for us as to what to do, what not to do should I say, we can't we can't use pindown, you can't shut them in a room, you can't physically restrain them, so how does one of the workers in the home stop them from going out?<endOfText>
<human>I'm meeting Virginia Bottomley next Monday afternoon at central office and I'll be putting the I will be putting whow I will b I will be putting the very question to her as to we've had a lot of advice as what not to do, how do you chastise the children in the homes?<endOfText>
<bot>So what of Councillor  claim that it's all down to lack of Government cash.<endOfText>
<human>I'd rather be constructive about this and meet Virginia Bottomley, put these points to her as an all party thing cos we've all said in Social Services that that is the problem that we're faced with.<endOfText>
<bot>But what of Councillor  claim then about Government cash?<endOfText>
<human>It's the children themselves in the homes who'd graffitied the walls, broken up the fabric of the homes.<endOfText>
<bot>No amount of money would have stopped them, or is that if there was Laura Ashley on the walls they wouldn't bother spraying it?<endOfText>
<human>I don't think money will solve any of these problems.<endOfText>
<bot>Would more Government money in the home stop young girls going out to engage in prostitution?<endOfText>
<human>I don't think so.<endOfText>
<bot>May be Councillor  efforts'd be better employed asking his leader to stop wasting public money and direct a bit more into Social Services<endOfText>
<human>hear hear<endOfText>
<bot>You talk of the, you talk of er wo should we take it out of this, should we take it out of that, Councillor .<endOfText>
<human>received a thirty two point seven million pound increase from the Government compared to last years' i revenue support grant and this doesn't include the additional money given for the Community Charge.<endOfText>
<bot>But your group sold the children's budget woefully short.<endOfText>
<human>You were told at the time you did, and Councillor  told you at the time that th it was totally inadequate was the children's budget, so how can you expect more money from the Government when your sense of priorities is so blatantly wrong on the money that you're already handling.<endOfText>
<bot>I make a plea for Councillor  not to use the children as a political football.<endOfText>
<human>This matter could have been put forward.<endOfText>
<bot>We could have tried to address the problem without all this talk of more Government cash, more this, more that, more the other.<endOfText>
<human>Let's all get together.<endOfText>
<bot>The policies are starting to work, as we've already heard from Councillor .<endOfText>
<human>We're very far advanced in our Social Services department.<endOfText>
<bot>The policy of trying to get more foster children is picking up momentum.<endOfText>
<human>Let's all work together to promote more fostering, get the children into family environments wherever possible.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you Lord Mayor.<endOfText>
<human>Councillor <endOfText>
<bot>Thank you Lord Mayor <endOfText>
<human>Er, I er hope Councillor  has got his pen ready because there are one or two things I'd like him to mention to Virginia Bottomley and I wouldn't like him to forget them.<endOfText>
<bot>But er I'll deal first of all with the Children Act.<endOfText>
<human>Whilst most commentators are agreed that the Children Act 1989 is in the main a good Act, all of them, all of them Councillor  are critical of the fact that the Government has not properly provided Local Authorities with sufficient resources to implement the Act.<endOfText>
<bot>The Government deserves no praise for the Act.<endOfText>
<human>It was not their idea.<endOfText>
<bot>It was an idea which sprang from pressure groups and voluntary groups as well as Social Services departments, not to mention the House of Commons All Party Select Committee in 1984 .<endOfText>
<human>But I want to ask the Tories, I want to ask the Tories, and I want an answer.<endOfText>
<bot>If the Act is as good as it is claimed in their motion, why hasn't the Government ensured proper funding for it?<endOfText>
<human>Of course, of course the opposition won't <endOfText>
<bot>of course the opposition won't answer that question, but the truth is that it is the usual hallmark of the Tory Government not to fund anything properly.<endOfText>
<human>Look around you.<endOfText>
<bot>Is it not, we can mention this to Virginia Bottomley.<endOfText>
<human>It is not only the Children Act which is under-funded but the entire spectrum of Local Government and the National Health Services.<endOfText>
<bot>The fact remains, and will become more and more evident as the year goes by, that the deliberate under-funding of the Act was an act of incompetence by incompetent ministers.<endOfText>
<human>Ministers who should never be allowed to govern this country again, just as the Tories should never be allowed to run  again.<endOfText>
<bot>And while I'm talking Labour running , I notice that the original seconder if this motion was one Councillor , the former arch cash-cutter of Social Services<endOfText>
<human>will never be allowed to forget that she cut the Social Services budget by one tenth.<endOfText>
<bot>Money, incidentally, that we shall never be able to put back.<endOfText>
<human>She deformed Social Services and now has the gall to congratulate the Government for this under-funded Act.<endOfText>
<bot>If it was not for her, this Council would have had more opportunity of addressing some of the deep problems the Tories either created or left behind.<endOfText>
<human>Now what if I support in the main the aims of the Act, there are one or two areas I think that some things are not a good idea.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm concerned about the loss of the access of parental rights panel and the handing over of this work to the Courts and the lawyers.<endOfText>
<human>I take this opportunity to thank all the Councillors of both major parties who served on our access parental rights panels.<endOfText>
<bot>I feel that they did an excellent job<endOfText>
<human>Putting this putting this work to the Court will not, I fear, help the situation or improve matters for children or their parents.<endOfText>
<bot>In fact I think that making this a Court issue will deter some parents from seeking access to their children which is a very bad thing.<endOfText>
<human>I do not believe that magistrates will be able to show any greater compassion or understanding that our own elected members.<endOfText>
<bot>In fact, with the involvement of solicitors, I think the whole business will be less personal, with much less informality and genuine understanding.<endOfText>
<human>I must also say that I resent the tendency of the Act to line the pockets of lawyers out of the tragic situations of families and children in trouble.<endOfText>
<bot>If I was a cynical person, which you all know that I am not, I would have said it was the Government's intention to help lawyers make more money out of the Act.<endOfText>
<human>However, I shall confine myself to believing that it was an unintentional consequence.<endOfText>
<bot>Another area of this Act which I disagree with is over the definition of need.<endOfText>
<human>I remember in 1990 attending the same conference as Councillors  and Councillor , hearing from , the principle civil servant in charge of the Act, that the Government had not defined need and that would emerge through decisions made in Court.<endOfText>
<bot>In other words, the Government were too frightened by the cost of the Act that they refused to name a price.<endOfText>
<human>However, at the same time, the Government wilfully left Local Government to exposure of the law and the high cost of judicial reviews and High Court actions.<endOfText>
<bot>Only a Tory Government would be so irresponsible and unfeeling.<endOfText>
<human>Only ministers who have no understanding of either Local Government or Social Services would shrink from their own responsibilities in this way.<endOfText>
<bot>It was their duty and their responsibility to protect Local Government but instead they acted like cowards and ran away.<endOfText>
<human>Is that the order of the day?<endOfText>
<bot>Isn't that what we've come to expect from this worn out useless Government, that at the moment of decision making they run away?<endOfText>
<human>Didn't they do just the same with the Community Care Act?<endOfText>
<bot>When the All Party House of Commons Select Committee reported in 1984 and suggested a further review of child care legislation was needed, did the same Select Committee envisage the incompetence of the Government ministers of the day to so irresponsibly deal with their duties?<endOfText>
<human>Councillor , time's up please<endOfText>
<bot>Yes thank you.<endOfText>
<human>It's time for a change.<endOfText>
<bot>It's time we had ministers who will listen to Social Services and in a few months time we shall have them, a Labour Government.<endOfText>

<human>At this stage in the proceedings I'm going to adjourn Cou the Council meeting so that you can all have your tea.<endOfText>
<bot>We shall reassemble at er five minutes to seven.<endOfText>
<human>We now under er the powers to choose and the right to own<endOfText>
<bot>Lord Mayor, I'd like to firstly say why I refused to sit and listen to this next debate.<endOfText>
<human>I think it's the worse example of pure political self-indulgence that I have ever come across in the eight ye nearly eight years on this Council<endOfText>
<bot>I think, I regard it as an insult to the people who actually elected us to come to this Cou these Council meetings.<endOfText>
<human>I apologise on behalf of Council to the members of the press who are here, and to the Council officers who have to endure this and I am only grateful that there are not members of the public here to witness this total farce.<endOfText>
<bot>Now Councillor , you're entirely out of order but er<endOfText>
<human>however, I call upon Councillor  to move the motion, together with amendment K standing in his name.<endOfText>
<bot>Lord Mayor<endOfText>
<human>Are you going to move, formally move it?<endOfText>
<bot>I'll move it <endOfText>
<human>Shush.<endOfText>
<bot>Is the is there a seconder?<endOfText>
<human>Remarkable.<endOfText>
<bot>I call Councill Councillor  to move amendment G standing in his name<endOfText>
<human>I so move my Lord Mayor<endOfText>
<bot>Is there a seconder?<endOfText>
<human>In accordance with standing order A thirteen E, the opposition group has specified this motion as the one to which a minimum debating time of thirty minutes is to be allocated.<endOfText>
<bot>So we will proceed.<endOfText>
<human>Councillor <endOfText>
<bot>Thank you Lord Mayor.<endOfText>
<human>As I was saying, if the Labour Group would like to leave the chamber we don't really mind, if they stay out for the voting at the end of this debate which actually contrary<endOfText>
<bot>contrary to what, contrary to what Councillor er erm what's his name?<endOfText>
<human>Councillor  said, is extremely important to the people of  and we've learnt a lot in politics over the last ten years.<endOfText>
<bot>One that I look a lot more like the Prime Minister wearing my reading glasses than the Prime Minister actually looks like the Prime Minister and two, the hidden benefits of wearing your reading glasses, group, here, is that I can't see a thing over there and for the first time in ten years I'm gonna enjoy delivering a speech.<endOfText>
<human>The power to choose and the right to own.<endOfText>
<bot>The power of the individual to choose and the power of the individual to own is the central political plank of the Conservative Party and in fact goes back to Disraeli and one nation.<endOfText>
<human>If Councillor  had actually stayed, he would know why this is so important to the people of  whom I may say he has cruelly deserted by walking out of the debating chamber and what he's saying to the people of  is that Liberal Councillors A won't prepare speeches like his colleague earlier on or they won't stay in the debate they are not going to be properly represented when we take important decisions, both nationally and locally.<endOfText>
<bot>The Right to Buy given to all Council tenants opposed by the Labour Party, has allowed one point two million Council homes to be sold to their existing tenants and make them home owners, and home ownership is a central plank of our policy.<endOfText>
<human>It is no, it is no coincidence that in a question asked today to the Labour Party, we will find that we a year ago when the Tory's proposals were still being implemented, over eleven hundred people were granted in  the right to buy their own Council house.<endOfText>
<bot>This year, solidly under a Labour controlled Council, only two hundred and fifty people approximately have been allowed to exercise what actually is their legal right.<endOfText>
<human>We've had a debate on Local Management of Schools opposed by the Labour Party where we have seen that the right to choose their own children's quality of education and where school governing bodies can direct their cash where they want has been extremely popular.<endOfText>
<bot>And I don't apologise to the people of  that I voted with Councillor  to take a hundred administration jobs out of education and direct that money to the provision of education in the schools cos that that is what running the education department is about.<endOfText>
<human>hear hear<endOfText>
<bot>The city tecnol technological college was given the right, has given the right of education, a quality of education undreamed of by a n by the people who live in the inner cities of , particularly the Asian population of  opposed by the Labour Party, a Labour Party committed to scrapping and closing the C T C's and if they can't get<endOfText>
<human>Oh you my clap, if you can't get your way, what bullies you are.<endOfText>
<bot>We're not having the C T C playing football against our schools, God, how low can you actually sink?<endOfText>
<human>hear hear<endOfText>
<bot>What is wrong, what is wrong with increasing the levels of education in our schools up to the quality and level of education offered by the C T C?<endOfText>
<human>And why does the Labour Party in  always want to level things down?<endOfText>
<bot>Under the Conservative Government the green belt in England has doubled in twelve years.<endOfText>
<human>If it was up to the  Labour Party it'd be halved in two.<endOfText>
<bot>And we've seen, we've seen the commitment to Local Government, haven't we, on the planning application on the , where two local Councillors, two Labour Councillors, sitting there, listened so much to their electorate that they abstain when it comes up to the vote?<endOfText>
<human>They abstain.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, where's people's commitment to Local Government in circumstances like that?<endOfText>
<human>Under the Conservative Government the people in Great Britain, including  people, have been given the opportunity of shareholding undreamed of before opposed opposed by the Labour Party.<endOfText>
<bot>And what does  say about that? says that we will keep the level of charges down in the now privately owned companies providing public utilities so there'll be nothing for dividends.<endOfText>
<human>I hope he's gonna put that in your manifesto.<endOfText>
<bot>I hope the eleven million who own shares in those operations know that under a Labour Government there will be no dividends.<endOfText>
<human>The Citizens Charter announced by the Conservative Party has been one <endOfText>
<bot>of the most outs , you may laugh, at least you stayed in<endOfText>
<human>Try reading it, try reading it some time because what it says to the people of  is, if you don't like the level of services being provided by your Council, if you feel your Council are not giving you value for money, then we're gonna give you the right to complain about it and do something.<endOfText>
<bot>And that brings us on to the question of money.<endOfText>
<human>We've heard tonight, and I do not believe it, a plea from Councillor , the Chairman of Social Services, that he wants ring fencing of Local Government money, I E the Government sends us our money and says, you will spend it on that and that and that and there will be now power of Local Councils to decide what the needs are in their areas and what their priorities are.<endOfText>
<bot>Now if you want to serve as a Local Councillor, Councillor  where you are told by any Government what the priorities of  people are, on the services that we deliver, than I want no part of that in Local Government.<endOfText>
<human>No more than I want any part in Local Government where Councillors and Officers can spend twenty thousand pounds tripping all over Europe and let's put something straight, the T and A tonight, which we all believe, says Councillor  has no right to complain about that cos he went on a jet plane to Brussels.<endOfText>
<bot>There was nothing in our press release, in fact the contrary, criticising the Labour Party Officers going to Brussels where we've had tremendous support over the last ten years.<endOfText>
<human>And if we did spent twelve hundred pounds on an aeroplane and came back with fifty million pounds worth of grants, I'm not apologising for that.<endOfText>
<bot>I actually don't think I actually don't think that the Community Charge payers of  should pay for Councillor  to go and watch a circus in Denmark.<endOfText>
<human>If he wants to watch a circus, he can attend the Labour Group  Labour Group meetings every month , the Labour Group meetings every month.<endOfText>
<bot>We don't think we don't think that the citizens of  are doing cartwheels at sixty four thousand pound being spent on a benefit bus to tour round this district and certainly if the  festival organisers two years ago could commit themselves to breaking even within two years and were happy with that, why have we spent two hundred and forty thousand pound on a festival in  when that money, and that's four hundred thousand pounds worth of money, could have been spent on the salaries and training of our officers who work in children's homes.<endOfText>
<human>No, we didn't sack anybody who worked in children's homes, we didn't sack anybody who was at the front line of s services and we certainly didn't expect other people to pay for our circus tickets.<endOfText>
<bot>didn't sack anybody <endOfText>
<human>We actually believe that the people of  would prefer prefer their money spending on the environment and front end services.<endOfText>
<bot>And we actually believe that it's the individual's power to choose.<endOfText>
<human>What is now worrying us extremely about Local Government in Britain, in any Labour Authority, which is spreading now like a cancer in , that officers are not trusted now to even take the sick list of decisions so there has to be another sub-committee.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, I'm not that rude as to say that's for the payment of allowances, but some people may say that.<endOfText>
<human>Officers are paid to implement  <endOfText>
<bot>you can speak in a second.<endOfText>
<human>Officers are paid to implement our policies.<endOfText>
<bot>They're certainly not paid<endOfText>
<human>nursing homes.<endOfText>
<bot>Where's the power to choose for those elderly people that want free at the point of service National Health Service treatment?<endOfText>
<human>It was, or it has been, a believe that the N H S was for all of us from the cradle to the grave.<endOfText>
<bot>It's now a sick joke in the Health Service, it's from the cradle to the Waldergrave.<endOfText>
<human>The  Trusts are in serious financial difficulties and may well be one million pound or two million pound in debt before the end of this financial year.<endOfText>
<bot>And quite rightly, it's gonna be the subject of a Parliamentary Health  Committee Enquiry which starts next week.<endOfText>
<human>Meanwhile, it's chief executive, it's brains, it's driving force, is getting out.<endOfText>
<bot>He says quote, there's unfish unfinished business for the Trust but not for me.<endOfText>
<human>And he's so desperate to get out he'll take a twenty thousand pound a year pay cut.<endOfText>
<bot>He's obviously abandoning the sinking ship cos he knows what's happening to it.<endOfText>
<human>Now what effect is that gonna have on the staff who can't leave?<endOfText>
<bot>Having said that, three hundred are been forced to leave, three hundred are being sacked, as we've heard before.<endOfText>
<human>Nurses are actually being sacked at .<endOfText>
<bot>The official term is released, not sacked, released, made redundant.<endOfText>
<human>But that's been consistent because there are three thousand less nurses this year in the N H S than there were last year.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't believe that's because people are being treated better, or more people are being treated better, but at a cost of eighty million pound, there are four thousand more managers or accountants, people brought in from business, people who will do business, people who will sort out privatisation.<endOfText>
<human>Now the Trust refuse to publish their business plans.<endOfText>
<bot>These are the multi million pound supposedly public money going into it.<endOfText>
<human>Whey do they do that?<endOfText>
<bot>Because they're in the business of competing with other hospitals, competing for treatment, competing with doctors.<endOfText>
<human>That's not co-operation, that's not a comprehensive Health Service, that's moving towards privatisation.<endOfText>
<bot>Now I think it's a bit rich t to slam the Liberals for walking out on the last debate because the Tories didn't attend the Health Trust Select Committee which  Council set up.<endOfText>
<human>I wish they had have attended, the Tories, because there were very very few people prepared to come and speak in favour of Trusts.<endOfText>
<bot>Even the proposers from the  Trust would not come and talk to the public.<endOfText>
<human>Not surprisingly, I heard today that in in  there's to be a judicial review on the supposed  Trust because they've not given enough information to the public on which to start their enterprise.<endOfText>
<bot>The survival of the N H S is going to be a major election issue and I know who's gonna win it.<endOfText>
<human>Nobody trusts the Trusts, it seems, except the Conservatives and I fear that we're only a General Election away from a fully privatised Health Service.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, give us the power to choose at the election.<endOfText>
<human>The position of the Conservative Party is clear.<endOfText>
<bot>Opting out hospitals, two tier Health Service, an internal market, competition for business, competition for people's illnesses and treatments, secrecy, less accountability, and privatisation.<endOfText>
<human>It's already happening.<endOfText>
<bot>Labour Party will bring these Trusts back into Health Service and to public control.<endOfText>
<human>One of the reasons why they're having such a hard time with trying to privatise the Health Service is because the British public actually feel they own it, they feel a part of it, they feel it's theirs, they know where the hospitals are, they know they can get treatment and they don't abuse it.<endOfText>
<bot>The Government are steam- rolling these reforms through but the Trusts are failing, failing in , they're failing all over.<endOfText>
<human>It is true.<endOfText>
<bot>For the first fifty seven of them to be set up , at a cost of half a million pounds, did a survey and found that only twelve of the fifty seven were financially viable and that didn't include the  Trust.<endOfText>
<human>The public do not believe the N H S is safe in Tory hands.<endOfText>
<bot>hear hear<endOfText>
<human>Give them the power to choose at the General Election and they will decide the future of the N H S. The future of the N H S is safe with the Labour Party, with your lot it's privatisation, it's started already and we're a General Election away from the end of the N H S.<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor  <endOfText>
<human>right to the very bitter end I assure you.<endOfText>
<bot>Lord Mayor, we've always been opposed to Trusts because of their independent nature which we see as really making it impossible because of that very nature to plan for health care properly.<endOfText>
<human>The two are really incompatible in the way that the Trusts are deemed to operate.<endOfText>
<bot>But one of the problems with attacking Trust, I mean it may be possible to to envisage some sort of modified Trust with some local input at some stage without the contracting apparatus.<endOfText>
<human>It may be possible to envisage a Trust that could work and could operate.<endOfText>
<bot>There are many simil similarities after all with the D N U's anyway.<endOfText>
<human>And really we ought to be concentrating far more upon the other other changes which are proposed other than the Trusts and the things that in fact are fo far worse in my my own opinion.<endOfText>
<bot>Most of the problems that are arising are not just because of the Trusts but because of other things like for instance the contracting process that is proposed, the t the changing in the financing that is incorporated and of course the general under-funding which there is within the N H S. These are far more important problems in the long term.<endOfText>
<human>Now, paragraph four of our amendment here is not really designed to knock the Labour Party.<endOfText>
<bot>It's really more to do with the er means rather than the ends, which I think we sh we all share and so i it was actually included more out of of sadness than anger and we tearfully put the word regret, not condemns, but regret really, the way that the campaign has been launched against the Trust.<endOfText>
<human>What we feel is that by going at it like a bull in a china shop,we all sorts of accusations of widespread privatisation has actually backfired.<endOfText>
<bot>It's been a classic g case of scoring a lot of home goals here, which the Tories have actually benefited from.<endOfText>
<human>Talking about privatising the National Health Service and opting out of the National Health Service is not actually very helpful because people don't believe that, they don't believe it's er N H S P L C. They do not, it is not a British Gas, it is not a British Telecom, they know it's not and it devalues your argument if you talk of it in those terms, and it allows Waldergrave to stand up and to renounce and reject your statements and weaken your case.<endOfText>
<bot>The impression is that the Tories are winning the debate because you're having to amend some of your earlier statements.<endOfText>
<human>You're not walking, not about widespread privatisation, but creeping privatisation and you're now talking about not opting out of the National Health Service but you're now talking about opting out of local national Health Service control.<endOfText>
<bot>People know this, they identify with this, they recognise that you're back-tracking and it looks as though your ke case is hereby weakened.<endOfText>
<human>Now the problem is that the Tories do not have to privatise the National Health Service to damage it.<endOfText>
<bot>There are lots of other ways that they have found of doing it.<endOfText>
<human>The contracting system is damaging to the National Health Service.<endOfText>
<bot>The proposals to do away with nationally negotiated pay and condition will damage the Health Service.<endOfText>
<human>The attack on funding levels will damage it.<endOfText>
<bot>The G P's are in turmoil at the moment, the G P practices, they're in turmoil at the moment, that's damaging.<endOfText>
<human>It's interesting, there is no doubt, no doubt you are  there's a very learned journal called the Liberal Democrat News which<endOfText>
<bot>which you are no doubt.<endOfText>
<human>Now it reports in here a survey carried out in The Doctor, September the twenty sixth, and it was asking there who they actually supported in terms of the National Health Service changes, and you may be surprised to hear who in fact came out on top of that.<endOfText>
<bot>from doctors<endOfText>
<human>That's from doctors.<endOfText>
<bot>Doctors themselves saying that.<endOfText>
<human>On what the Labour Party have claimed for themself as being their issue.<endOfText>
<bot>Now that would worry me.<endOfText>
<human>That would worry me if I was a Labour Party member because you have got a good case but you are not putting it across in a way that convinces doctors themselves.<endOfText>
<bot>You are actually, I know that many doctors traditionally vote Conservative, but you are actually behind the Tories with only twenty one percent support.<endOfText>
<human>That must, should, worry you in terms of the case that you're putting across.<endOfText>
<bot>There are lots of things to attack the Conservatives on and it is a question of how that is actually done.<endOfText>
<human>We don't need to make things up.<endOfText>
<bot>We don't have to.<endOfText>
<human>All we have to do is tell it as it actually is and then trust the people themselves to decide.<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor  <endOfText>
<human>My Lord Mayor, I'm delighted to have this opportunity to debate the Government's health reforms again.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm disappointed by the two er contributions we've had so far.<endOfText>
<human>We've had a list of anecdotes designed to panic the public and patience of Councillor  and I was disappointed that Liberal don't seem to understand that the Health Authorities have now been given the op the responsibility for planning and provisional health care in er in health authorities.<endOfText>
<bot>This planning is being done in a way that it has never been done before and I'm surprised they haven't grasped that.<endOfText>
<human>I'd like to have a look at the er to examine Labour's motions today.<endOfText>
<bot>The three sections of it.<endOfText>
<human>The most important part of their, the first section of their of their er their motion is opting out of local N H S control.<endOfText>
<bot>Now this is a downright lie<endOfText>
<human>hear hear<endOfText>
<bot>again designed to er to panic the public.<endOfText>
<human>Government and hospitals are not opting out of the N H S at all, they are every much of it a as part of the Health Service as they every have been and you all know that and it's about time you stopped saying it.<endOfText>
<bot>They are now under local control, not opting out of local control, they are actually being managed locally and that is quite obvious to anybody<endOfText>
<human>They are no longer being managed by the Health Authority across the road, remotely, no no contact between the two, or not enough anyway, no longer being managed by a region fifty miles, or forty miles, whatever it is, up the road to .<endOfText>
<bot>What way is that to manage a hospital?<endOfText>
<human>Ma Trust hospitals are being managed locally within the hospital building and that's the way to do it.<endOfText>
<bot>They're being managed by the staff who work there.<endOfText>
<human>It's sensible.<endOfText>
<bot>How can anybody disagree with that?<endOfText>
<human>And I know a lot of Labour people do agree with that.<endOfText>
<bot>, who spoke so eloquently in this Chamber two years ago, has now joined the Trust staff.<endOfText>
<human>She was a candidate at  North a as your candidate there and now she's joined the Trust.<endOfText>
<bot>Some people are seeing the light, even from your own side.<endOfText>
<human>What would what what what are Labour's plans for the Health Service?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, we haven't heard any have we?<endOfText>
<human>All they w all they're saying they would do is restore it back to what it was.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, we all know what it was under Labour.<endOfText>
<human>Under Labour, under Labour waiting lists are always<endOfText>
<bot>under Labour waiting lists have gone up every time we've had a Labour administration.<endOfText>
<human>Every time we've had a Conservative administration waiting lists have gone down.<endOfText>
<bot>It's not as if the contribution of Labour Councillors to th to the management of Health Authorities has been very er productive.<endOfText>
<human>I've sat on the district management board of  Health Authority for four years and watched Labour Councillors coming sometimes, often not coming at all, sitting there saying nothing, debating very little in the way of useful contributions until, I have to say, Councillor  came along and er a er, sorry to get you unpopular with the rest of your colleagues<endOfText>
<bot>they seem to be there just to guard vested interests.<endOfText>
<human>It's no way to manage a Health Authority to have to have people coming along there to t guard their own vested interests.<endOfText>
<bot>Trades Union members<endOfText>
<human>As as Councillor  said, Labour keep altering their story about the Health Service.<endOfText>
<bot>They started off saying opting out of the Health Service, now we're opting of local N H S control.<endOfText>
<human>We started off with privatisation, now we've got creeping privatisation.<endOfText>
<bot>Well Labour were the first to introduce charges to people in the Health Service.<endOfText>
<human>They were the ones who started charging people for glasses and surgical appliances, wigs, things that are necessary and actually help in the management and care of patients.<endOfText>
<bot>They're the ones who started charging people.<endOfText>
<human>All Conservatives have done is put out services to tender such as cleaning, laundry and portering, and allowed those services to be provided by the company or, and sometimes the Health Authority, that gives the best deal.<endOfText>
<bot>There's no expense to the patients, no charge to patients, no cost to patients.<endOfText>
<human>There are are advantages to patients, better quality control, greater efficiency and financial savings ploughed back into patient care.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, if that's creeping privatisation, let's have some more of it.<endOfText>
<human>However, the Government has no intention to privatise health care.<endOfText>
<bot>We've had it straight and true from John Major.<endOfText>
<human>I believe him.<endOfText>
<bot>I agree with him and I would resign from the Conservative Party if it were anything else.<endOfText>
<human>I have worked for the Health Service for twenty six years and plan to carry on doing so and I fully expect to finish my work in the Health Service where it's still in Government hands.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's look at the second section of th of Labour's motion.<endOfText>
<human>Stated policy of Labour Party.<endOfText>
<bot>When I read the first six words of that I thought, good Lord, we're going to get a bit of policy here and but no, no, none of it.<endOfText>
<human>It's hardly a policy to say that they're stating we're intending to return the Trust to N H S when it's never left the N H S in the first place.<endOfText>
<bot>Labour has no constructive policies, or at least we haven't heard any.<endOfText>
<human>Councillor  came to a meeting in  and spoke for for th for twenty minutes or whatever it was.<endOfText>
<bot>He didn't give us a single inkling of anyth any Labour policies.<endOfText>
<human>All he did was suggest that the er the Health Authority chairman and the district general manager should resign, which which which he got the headlines for as, as designed, but it was no no contribution to the discussion about the Health Service whatsoever.<endOfText>
<bot>One of th one of Labour's own party, the supporters, has called the Labour policies for health care, if they exist, a process of fossilisation.<endOfText>
<human>As I said, I've worked in the health service for twenty six years.<endOfText>
<bot>I've seen strikes under Labour.<endOfText>
<human>I said this at the last time we discussed this.<endOfText>
<bot>I've seen Labour inspired Trade Union control of hospitals, I've seen the patient to be the last in Labour's priorities<endOfText>
<human>hear hear<endOfText>
<bot>Let's move to the third section.<endOfText>
<human>Considerable opposition in  to setting up Trusts.<endOfText>
<bot>Well this is a real joke.<endOfText>
<human>Everybody knows that the Community Health Trust had an extensive consultation exercise with the public.<endOfText>
<bot>They had m several public meetings.<endOfText>
<human>Less than ten people turned up.<endOfText>
<bot>And then the biggest joke, this Trust Select Committee, Councillor  Committee.<endOfText>
<human>It was planned originally that there would be three whole days packed with people coming to coming to pass an opinion.<endOfText>
<bot>It was watered down to three half days.<endOfText>
<human>Four hundred and seventeen individuals were invited to come, a hundred and fifteen organisations were invited.<endOfText>
<bot>Who turned up?<endOfText>
<human>A few Labour Councillors, a Labour M P, two or three Trade Union representatives, a G P a G P who happens to be a Councillors, Labour Councillor's wife and one or two others<endOfText>
<bot>Does this really show that the public of  are worried about the Trusts' hospitals.<endOfText>
<human>It's not my experience, sitting there in the in the clinics.<endOfText>
<bot>The practice of medicine is carrying on the same way as it has done before but we're addressing issues like quality and standards and timing and waiting lists in a way we haven't done before.<endOfText>
<human>I don't expect you to know this because you don't work there.<endOfText>
<bot>I do.<endOfText>
<human>So perhaps you'll take it from me<endOfText>
<bot>The truth, the truth is, the truth is that more and more people and organisations are realising the benefits of local control of N H S hospitals, as in the Trust hospitals.<endOfText>
<human>The public and especially hospital consultants are rapidly realising and acknowledging that Trust hospital status is a genuine attempt to address local health needs which is providing increasingly successful health care.<endOfText>
<bot>If we look at cons sa take consultant's views, I'm afraid that hospital consultants are not the quickest to grasp the advantages of reform.<endOfText>
<human>They didn't want the Health Service in the first place but we rapidly came round to it.<endOfText>
<bot>We didn't want the reforms it seems but now sixty to seventy percent of consultants are wanting the reforms.<endOfText>
<human>And we heard some figures about G P's, ninety two percent of those G P's who've got their own budgets are seeing the benefits to their patients and their patients are saying so as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Undoubtedly benefits are coming from those sorts of changes that come from the Health Service reforms.<endOfText>
<human>And then we come on to the final point, the whole issue of N H S changes in the final section.<endOfText>
<bot>Are Councillors  and  against all the changes in the Health Service, in the Government Health Service reforms?<endOfText>
<human>Have they read the white paper?<endOfText>
<bot>Are they against medical audit?<endOfText>
<human>Are they against financial audit?<endOfText>
<bot>Isn't it good to know the results of treatment?<endOfText>
<human>Isn't it good to know the costs of it?<endOfText>
<bot>I've said G P budget holding is a success and so are Trust hospitals.<endOfText>
<human>My Lord Mayor, I totally reject this motion as a load of baloney.<endOfText>
<bot>Trust hospitals are very successful and will continue to be so.<endOfText>
<human>hear hear<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor <endOfText>
<human>Lord Mayor, I've only been brought up under the National Health Service for thirty two years and I feel sorry for that poor doctor.<endOfText>
<bot>He started off as doctor in the house, then he moved to doctor at sea and now he's doctor in trouble, as a result of these Government policies.<endOfText>
<human>And it's clear, we're seeing already, that Health Authorities haven't got the money to refer patients to the Trusts unless the Government steps in and says, that's not Government policy, so you won't see the problems Councillor  because they won't get referred to you, will they?<endOfText>
<bot>The Government's policy is like an ailing comedy, carry on, except it's carry on regardless of professional and public opinion.<endOfText>
<human>The Government's dogma over the National Health Service has turned into panic.<endOfText>
<bot>The second wave of Trusts has become like a second hand car sale.<endOfText>
<human>It's accompanied by a wave of hysteria.<endOfText>
<bot>Some Government ministers denying privatisation, under-funding, they've even denied those holy grails of ownership and choice which are the foundation of the Tory Party.<endOfText>
<human>But the fact remains we can't trust the Trusts.<endOfText>
<bot>And I'll tell you what the problem is about the Trusts, and I'll explain why they are opting out of the National Health Service.<endOfText>
<human>Because the powers, responsibilities and assets of the National Health Service will be vested in a private Trust.<endOfText>
<bot>That's right, we'll be waiting, as we did with the  planning applications to come in on  hospital.<endOfText>
<human>They're not democratic, nor are they accountable.<endOfText>
<bot>Only two  have decided to hold their meetings in public.<endOfText>
<human>Not many, Councillor , not many of us are gonna have the choice to see the minutes of those Trust bodies.<endOfText>
<bot>The decisions that they make are gonna be based on comers commercial considerations, not health, so I'm sure the doctors won't be won't be bothered with decisions, Councillor  because the accountants will be making them for them.<endOfText>
<human>The fact is that it won't be an integrated service.<endOfText>
<bot>We'll all be separate cost units, won't we?<endOfText>
<human>Like the  ambulance service who is having to go out and find income, having to do health and safety checks at factories just when you need an ambulance.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, who can refer to the ambulance service when they're out making money and, of course, the staff are gonna suffer.<endOfText>
<human>As has been said, only one in five Trusts have said they'll honour the terms and conditions of the National Health Service workers and we've seen the disgraceful decisions that're being made in .<endOfText>
<bot>I'm sure we'll be seeing more of the same to follow, down the road at .<endOfText>
<human>The Trust process has been a sham.<endOfText>
<bot>There's been consultation.<endOfText>
<human>I waited eagerly every morning, would it drop through the door, this Trust leaflet?<endOfText>
<bot>I was wa I needed the information for that debate Councillor .<endOfText>
<human>It didn't arrive, even after  had given me assurance every household in  would get a leaflet.<endOfText>
<bot>They got them in .<endOfText>
<human>I don't know why, it's outside the area.<endOfText>
<bot>We didn't get em.<endOfText>
<human>So you can consult people in  about what's happening in  and wider afield.<endOfText>
<bot>The fact is, there's been a complete lack of consultation.<endOfText>
<human>It's only this Authority that  the consultation process in this district and you've had the answer, a resounding no to the Trusts.<endOfText>
<bot>I won't beat about the bush about creeping privatisation because in  it's become a stampede.<endOfText>
<human>It's unique amongst Health Authorities.<endOfText>
<bot>Every part of the National Health Service in  is gonna be placed under the auspices of the Trust.<endOfText>
<human>That isn't creeping, that's a stampede.<endOfText>
<bot>And we're gonna see a three pronged attack against the public service.<endOfText>
<human>Privatisation in three ways, increasing compulsory competitive tendering, and we know what that is at , we've seen it  plan, quality control, can't clean the operating theatres.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, that really helps patients.<endOfText>
<human>They'll be coming out with more diseases than they went in with<endOfText>
<bot>Specialist services specialist services hiving off.<endOfText>
<human>Let's talk with  Water, let's talk with B T, anybody providing we can get a bit of private income in there.<endOfText>
<bot>And a greater role for private health insurance.<endOfText>
<human>We know who's jumping the queue and we know which directors of the Health Authority have got private health insurance in .<endOfText>
<bot>We know who they'll be jumping over, yes, the people who haven't got the choice of private health insurance Councillor  because they can't afford it.<endOfText>
<human>And what stinks about it is vested interests to the fore.<endOfText>
<bot>was a great man but the only problem was he left a vested interested in the National Health Service and that's coming to the fore.<endOfText>
<human>And yes, a district general manager should've resigned because he had an interest in the decision to go for the Trust status.<endOfText>
<bot>had the decency to resign in  but not in .<endOfText>
<human>We don't trust the Trusts.<endOfText>
<bot>We know what it means.<endOfText>
<human>I can't give you a strategy on how to fund the National Health Service.<endOfText>
<bot>We know that the British Medical Association say it's under-funded to the tune of six billion pounds but we'll say what we said before we took control of this Council, we'll open the books and we'll direct resources to priorities.<endOfText>
<human>And chief amongst Labour priorities is the National Health Service.<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor  <endOfText>
<human>still not a sign of any policy from them on the Health Service, par for the course.<endOfText>
<bot>Lord Mayor, the Conservative Group welcomes this opportunity to debate reforms in the National Health Service.<endOfText>
<human>The only disappointment is the lack of substance in Councillor  motion.<endOfText>
<bot>I must confess to be somewhat surprised to see the Labour Group wanting to debate thisu this issue again after their lack lustre performance in Committee and Council on the previous debates on this subject and today's been no different.<endOfText>
<human>Let's look at this issues.<endOfText>
<bot>At the last Council meeting I quoted figures on comparative performance of the Conservative record on health against Labour's and I make no apology for reiterating some of these figures, and you can howl and you can wail and you can say what you want, these are facts.<endOfText>
<human>No, these are facts that can be borne out.<endOfText>
<bot>Nurses pay has risen by forty eight percent ahead of inflation.<endOfText>
<human>Under Labour it was cut by five percent.<endOfText>
<bot>Doctors pay is up thirty nine percent after inflation, under Labour it was cut by seventeen percent.<endOfText>
<human>The Party that are the bastions of the Health Service.<endOfText>
<bot>Just over one million additional hospital cases were treated in 1989, compared with seventy eight.<endOfText>
<human>The number of in-patients treated has increased by one point two million.<endOfText>
<bot>Waiting lists have risen, as Councillor  has already said, under every Labour Government, and fallen under every Conservative Government since the N H S was founded.<endOfText>
<human>That is fact.<endOfText>
<bot>That is fact.<endOfText>
<human>It's ten o'clock.<endOfText>
<bot>That is fact Lord Mayor and these facts will bear out.<endOfText>
<human>I challenge Councillor  to bring me the evidence saying otherwise.<endOfText>
<bot>So<endOfText>
<human>if it's doing so well<endOfText>
<bot><endOfText>
<human>Get into Microfit, when you're in the data input menu  I'd like you to call up the file Q M four FIT <endOfText>
<bot>Q M four FIT  file  file .<endOfText>
<human>If you just look at the er  the sheet, that we've handed out, they  loaded from er from the computer it's that data that's in front of you, right, we've got three, three series, right, it's times  data, right, from nineteen twenty three to nineteen forty five, right and the three variables are, textile consumption,United States er real, sorry  is benevolence of the U S, so it's textile consumption,capita, real income er per capita income to be adjusted through inflation, so  constant money terms and what the relative price of textiles P erm the price of textiles relative to the general level er the general price level.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay what we're going to be doing is estimating a demand function   so we can specify the textile consumption as a function of real incomes per capita and also relative prices, alright.<endOfText>
<human>A priori, what sign would we expect on those two variables?<endOfText>
<bot>Say the income, what sign would you expect to observe?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah positive providing textiles are a normal good, you should observe positive er income consumption response okay.<endOfText>
<bot>How about prices?what code, what sign do we expect on the er the price variable there?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah negative, right, textiles rise faster, the price of textiles rises faster than the general price level, the real increase in textile prices, therefore, we'd expect  providing the first law of demand holds, that we get a negative response consumption, right.<endOfText>
<bot>So that's what we expect a priori a positive coefficient, a negative, coefficient, positive on income, negative on prices.<endOfText>
<human>What we are actually going to do today is to look  using this data, is to look at structural stability, right, we're going to ask ourselves are the parameters that we estimate over the entire sample, are they constant over time.<endOfText>
<bot>There's no point in estimating a model  if in reality those coefficients are not fixed, they're jumping all over the place.<endOfText>
<human>Right with those parameters, so if you just look at the er coefficional income, if we estimate the coefficional income to be nought point five right, over the entire sample, the then subsequently find out if that coefficient varies from year to year from minus six plus ten, right, having a one point estimate, right, er oh that coefficient is not going to be particularly useful to us, we want to know er whether our coefficients remain reasonably constant throughout our sample period, particularly if we're using this er equation to make out of sample predictions, right.<endOfText>
<bot>The first thing we must er be sure of is that the coefficients within the sample are reasonably, er reasonably constant, right.<endOfText>
<human>If they are not reasonably constant, then not only is the model er a poor one, right, within sample but it can't really be used for out of sample predictions, because although on average er our coefficient that we estimate it might be nought point five, then the out of sample could well be minus six or something like that.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, so you need to know that our model is characterized by constant parameters over the sample.<endOfText>
<human>Now the data that we've got here has been artificially generated.<endOfText>
<bot>the last six observations of it has, right, the first six observations, sorry the er the first twenty odd observations are real, right, that they haven't been made up but the last six observations have been made up, right, to er to illustrate structural change.<endOfText>
<human>We will assume that we don't know that there is structural change in this data, although a priori, we might expect it.<endOfText>
<bot>Why, why might we expect structural change to occur in this example?<endOfText>
<human>Anything in particular?<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, yeah, that's right, this s this series a particularly volatile period of economic history in the nineteen thirties, the Great Depression, in addition what's at the end of the series?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah the Second World War, right, so er I can tell you now that in actual fact there's no structural change during the thirties here but there is structural change during the war.<endOfText>
<bot>Textile consumption, or the parameters that we estimate during peacetime no longer er explain textile consumption during wartime.<endOfText>
<human>Right, I'm going to go through methods of how we can detect structural change by the non constant parameters.<endOfText>
<bot>The first thing we'll do is look at the data, alright, so if you go from the action menu into option one, right, we're going to plot er go through to the transform edit<endOfText>
<human>option, go into the data processing environment, right, where your three variables are listed T C I P.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, if you just give the command Plot T C Plot space T C then press the return key<endOfText>
<human>right, that's textile consumption over our sample.<endOfText>
<bot>Now it's not immediately obvious from that time series that there's a structural break, right, textile consumption hasn't fallen dramatically, right, or risen dramatically over the post war period, oh sorry du during the er the war period.<endOfText>
<human>Nevertheless we can show that there is significant structural change er in the model that we'll<endOfText>
<bot>estimate.<endOfText>
<human>Right, so by looking at the graph, I am just trying to impress upon you that structural change cannot always be spotted simply by looking at the data  right, anyway, let's now  move on to estimate our first model.<endOfText>
<bot>What we are going to be doing is trying to explain that series, right that er consumption series.<endOfText>
<human>So if you press the escape key we'll go back to the data processing environment, right.<endOfText>
<bot>What we're going to do is to log all our variables, right, so if you let L N T C equal  open brackets T C close brackets, right, we going to define a new variable L N T C.<endOfText>
<human>That's going to be the natural logarithm, right, of our original series T C textile consumption.<endOfText>
<bot>If you now plot L N T C  right, if you plot L N T C  you should have a very similar graph to the one that you had before.<endOfText>
<human>Alright, logging the data doesn't change the nature of the data, what it does do is that it re-scales the data, okay so the only thing that's, that's, that's changed by logging, right, is the scale of the cr is the vertical scale on the graph, right, but essentially we are still trying to model the same series and N T C is essentially the same series as T C.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, so if you press the escape key, once you've had a look at the data, er if you log all the other variables er if you let L N I equal log open brackets I close brackets  let L N P equal log open brackets P close brackets, press the return key.<endOfText>
<human>Okay has everyone created those three variables in logs?<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, right what we are going to er do now is create a constant, we'll need a constant for our regressions  so if you type the letter Q to come out of the data processing environment  right type the letter Q right and then go into the er constant creation menu, which is option one of the data processing menu  right,you'll, you'll be asked for a name for  if you like call it C or constant or Fred Bloggs, just supply a name  to your constant term.<endOfText>
<human>By the way has everybody changed erm the password or their password, have you changed it to your date of birth, have you all done that because if you haven't, you've only got six grace log-ins on erm where your password is your user name.<endOfText>
<bot>If you don't change<endOfText>
<human>your password within six er times of logging in then you will be excluded from the network.<endOfText>
<bot>So you won't be able to log on to Microfit?<endOfText>
<human>Right,okay, so has everybody created a constant  right, what we are going to do now is to er estimate the first model right equation one on the sheets that you've been given, alright, you've created a constant, we've got our variables L N T C L N I L N P <endOfText>
<bot>right so if press the letter Q to quit from the data processing environment and press the return key, head towards the action menu, right, when you are in the action menu, go to option two, which is the estimate option, right, and you should then be given a dialog box.<endOfText>
<human>If you then specify your equation, so it's L N T C your dependent variable space, whatever the name you called your constant then L N I space L N P.<endOfText>
<bot>Now just specify the variables that you want in this regression, right, your dependent variable first  okay when you've specified the equation, sorry   once you specify the equation press the end key which is between the alphabetic and the numeric key pads, that will then submit that request, right.<endOfText>
<human>If you then er, it will then ask you over what period do you want to  right so if you press the end key that will submit the job erm it asks for the sample period, we're going to use the whole of the sample, so if you just press the return key, that's the default for the whole of the sample, right, it then asks you what procedure you want to use to estimate the model, we're going to use O L S  option one, just press the return key O L S then  the computer has estimated the model, right.<endOfText>
<bot>Before we move on, let's just have a look at those numerical estimates, can we look at the coefficients on income, notice that in this model because we've logged both dependent and the independent variables, right, the coefficients that we estimate are elasticities, right, so we can read those coefficients off directly as elasticities and that's the case for any model in which all the variables are logged  right, in er, if we didn't log the data, in order to calculate the elasticity we have to multiply a coefficient the computer gives us by a erm price quantity ratio, price less, less  part of the income constant ratio to obtain the income elasticities.<endOfText>
<human>Alright but in any double logged mode, right, the coefficients you estimate are elasticities, so we look at the incoming elasticity, we get a measure, or we get an estimate point six eight, right, that's a positive as we would expect suggesting that er erm textiles are a normal good, right.<endOfText>
<bot>Notice that an incoming elasticity is less than unity, and that's less than one, as a result  textiles, textile industry in the Netherlands is going to be a declining sector in the economy, right, as incomes  er per capita G D P rises, the textile sector will benefit, alright, because, because human demand for textiles either they're demanding proportionately less of any increases in incomes.<endOfText>
<human>Right, then so as a result the textiles would be a  and relative decline to the rest of the economy.<endOfText>
<bot>Is that  a T ratio on that incoming elasticity?<endOfText>
<human>Is that coefficient statistically significant, is it significantly different from zero?<endOfText>
<bot>Our estimate  incoming elasticity, just  the T ratio  would you say.<endOfText>
<human>T ratio of one point four nine.<endOfText>
<bot>Typically we use the rule of thumb to  statistical significance so if we have a T ratio that's less than two<endOfText>
<human>we can infer that that coefficient to which the T ratio is attached is not significantly zero.<endOfText>
<bot>In actual fact our incoming elasticity there with er nought point six is statistically significant zero, eighty five percent confidence level.<endOfText>
<human>Confidence  right the figure in the square brackets next to the T ratio gives you the significance level of the coefficient, right.<endOfText>
<bot>We normally use the five percent significance level or the ten percent significance level which corresponds er ninety five percent confidence or ninety percent confidence  right.<endOfText>
<human>So this T ratio on income elasticity is for the bit  right and if we were using the five percent or ten percent as our sort of cut off point, we'd actually discard income from our consumption, from our demand function.<endOfText>
<bot>Now as economists we should have strong prides about income in this model, we would all, we would expect income to be very important in explaining textile consumption although the model is telling us at the moment, income doesn't seem to be significantly explained in textile consumption so that's something to worry about, we're getting some, er sort of peculiar results here.<endOfText>
<human>We now look at the er  price  unity as a T ratio minus ten, right, so it's highly significant, right and the er figure in square brackets, the probability value next to the T ratio tells you that we get  least ninety nine point nine percent confidence  coefficiency  price elasticity demand  significantly different from zero  right, now is everybody happy interpreting the coefficient right and the T ratio?<endOfText>
<bot>If not say now and we can go through it.<endOfText>
<human>It is vitally important that you know <endOfText>
<bot>how to distinguish a statistically significant coefficient, right, rule of thumb is that the T ratio has to be greater than two with absolute value  right and the figures in square brackets next to the T ratios tell us the exact level of significance, right, er of that coefficient, right, so the incoming elasticity of demand is statistically significant from zero only at the eighty five percent level, a correspondence of fifteen percent significance that  incoming  the price elasticity demand, highly significant, right, significance level as given by the probabil by the probability er unit in square brackets, the timing level  therefore we could be very highly confident about that  coefficient okay.<endOfText>
<human>So we've got this model, right, we've estimated the model, let's now have a look at the plot of actual and predicted.<endOfText>
<bot>So if you press the return key  right, we just get a whole list of diagnostic test statistics that we won't look at at the moment, press the return key again, come to the post regression menu, you go into option three which is a list plot option.<endOfText>
<human>Now the plot actual and fitted, right, so we try to explain the actual block of textile consumption as the blue line and to do that we are using our model with those fixed estimates, the incoming elasticity and the price elasticity.<endOfText>
<bot>As you can see there, the model is breaking down during the latter period of our sample.<endOfText>
<human>The notice that appears to track the data quite well up until about nineteen thirty, right and then after nineteen thirty it seems to get progressively worse.<endOfText>
<bot>Now we may suggest that that's the effect of the Second World War biasing alright biasing the estimates that we've just produced from the whole sample.<endOfText>
<human>Now because   I'll leave that for a moment  right, so one way we may test the structural change, right, is to construct what's called a dummy variable and a dummy variables in a wide variety of applications  they can be used to er get rid of er outlying observations, very very high or very very low observations.<endOfText>
<bot>They can also be used for tests for structural change, right, what we're going to do is to say during peacetime  right, we'll estimate our model, we'll then estimate our model during wartime and we're going to assume that the coefficients or the income and price elasticity  mark, don't change during between peace and wartime, all that happens is as they intercept this model shifts, right, now you may thinks that's not particularly er attractive, you might expect the price of income elasticities to change between two periods and we could actually use dummy variables to see whether that is the case, right, however, we'll get very similar results, right, if you just use a slope dummy so it'd intercept dummy, right, and all that's going to do is to say, well the model runs like this in peacetime, right, and then wartime it suddenly shifts up or down depending on the effect of er of the war on textile consumption.<endOfText>
<human>Right, so what we're going to do is create a dummy variable to test that hypothesis, right, so if you press the escape key, right, and work your way back towards erm the data processing sort of environment, so go back to the post regression menu through the backtracking menu erm, when you're in the backtracking menu, go to option six, which is the process plot edit option  right, now press the return key in the data processing menu, right, and that will get you to the data processing environment when we can start messing about with our variables.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, what we are going to do now is create a dummy variable, right, let's call it D one right so if you type D one equals zero and press the return key  what you created there, right, is a new variable called D one and it assumes the value of zero, right, what I want you to do now is to edit this variable, so type edit space D one press the return key  right, if you type on edit space D one you'll then get a sheet that has all the observations for our variable D one.<endOfText>
<human>Using the cursor key move down to nineteen, the observation for nineteen forty  right when you've done that type the letter one  and then press the return key, right, and you'll see that the observation is changed, right, from zero to one.<endOfText>
<bot>Move the cursor to nineteen forty one, right, and then press one again, press return key.<endOfText>
<human>Just go through the remainder  of the, of the observations, so that you should have zeros up until nineteen forty and then at nineteen forty through to nineteen forty five, right, you have ones.<endOfText>
<bot>When you've finished doing that, press the end key.<endOfText>
<human>Right the end key will save the edit that you've just made  okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, what we're now going to do is incorporate that dummy variable as the regressor in our model as an explanatory variable, so what's going to happen is that that dummy variable is turned off, alright in the first part of the sample right up until the war that dummy variable's going to be off, right so it has a value of zero, right, then in nineteen forty through to nineteen forty five it's switched on and what it's going to do is to pick up any differential effects, right, in the intercept between wartime and peacetime  right, we'll talk a little bit more, more about that in a second, we're going to add it in as a regressor, right, because it only comes on during the wartime it will pick up any shift in the intercept, right, that occurs due to the war if there is one, of course there may not be but it's quite likely that there, there may well be, so if you type Q to come out of the data processing environment, go back to the action menu and test estimate forecast  okay at the dialog box just add D one to your list of explanatory variables, alright then press the end key, right, yeah we're gonna use the full sample  right, we gonna use O L S, right you have now estimated the model with this dummy variable  now just to see what's happened to those coefficients  the er incoming elasticity was at nought point six is now doubled  right to one point one four  more importantly, right, its T ratio has jumped from one point eight five  right to six point eight, as a result, we now say that the incoming elasticity, the income coefficients, right, the significant  zero, it's important to explain the textiles as such  the er, we are now getting a very different estimate for our<endOfText>
<human>our estimate for price elasticity is four and one to nought point eight minus one is one point eight, notice though that its  ratio has jumped  considerably or has doubled  and the dummy variable itself  is very significant  the T ratio ten  the coefficient on that dummy variable tells us the effect of the war on textile consumption, right so on average textile consumption rose by point two  er see what the units of measurement are  we don't actually have  units of er ah so we'll <endOfText>
<bot>elasticity  whatever it's multiplied by <endOfText>
<human>That's right if you er  so this point two quantifies the effect of the war on our equation, and where is the so the intercept, well what you're saying is in peacetime the intercept is equation three point one seven, however, in war time the intercept shifts up and is now three point one seven plus point two,<endOfText>
<bot>You could draw it like that  you could say that this is the  the war which cuts in this time of year  line shifts up,<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>so if you wanted it back, you would actually get a new value for the intercept which increases by nought point two  three point<endOfText>
<human>Three point one  okay so this is where the model, in effect what we've done which is a very crude way, right, of erm incorporating exogamous influences, right, we haven't said tha that the war is going to affect the income or price elasticity what we did do, right, all that we're doing is that we're allowing the intercept of our model to change, right, now as a result, we've got, we can prove the st the statistical significance of all the variables in our model, right, the co the actual coefficients that we've estimated have changed  quite significant, particularly in the er the incoming elasticity, right, the incoming elasticity was less than one, right, and insignificance before was now greater than one and height of R squared has also increased dramatically our measure of explanatory power.<endOfText>
<bot>Now if you just press the return key a couple of times  right, and have a lot of actual and fitted, if you go into option three in the data  post depression menu  you will notice that the fit of our model is very very different  right, so we are now getting a very very good correspondence between actual and fitted, notice that in our original model the thing started to break down at about nineteen thirty, right, just by allowing the intercept to vary, right, over the wartime we've now got a much better fit throughout the whole period  why is that the case?<endOfText>
<human>Why are we now getting a much better fit throughout the entire period simply by incorporating the dummy variable to the war period?<endOfText>
<bot>Any suggestions?<endOfText>
<human>Well what's happening is it the, during the war, right, we're constraining the computer to estimate, like a single coefficient that is applicable to both war and peacetime er isn't the case, right,th there is a structural change, right, so when th when we constrain the computer to estimate the coefficients throughout the whole period, right, the coefficients are biased but if they don't apply either to the post er pre war peacetime sample neither do they er fit very well to the data during the wartime, right, if we allow the intercept to change but we're getting much better estimates both wartime and peacetime er parameter's okay because we haven't got rid of, we've got rid of that bias, right, in constraining the parameters to fit both wartime and peacetime er time periods.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, erm  on this sheet, I don't think, well we won't go through it now because we've run out of time.<endOfText>
<human>On this sheet, on page two, we've er, we've performed equation two, right, on the sheet and the second page and it says that there's, there are two alternative ways of testing for structural change using dummy variables.<endOfText>
<bot>One is to include corporate dummy variable of the intercept and see whether it's T ratio or significantly different, is, sorry it's greater than two  right or we can use an F test, right, now that F test that's given me that formula in the middle of the page is a very important  test which was developed by a chap called Chow and as a result it become known as the Chow test and it's a, it's a test for parameter constancy, er do we have constant parameters in our model  now it tells you how to compute this Chow test, in this particular case we're only dummying the intercept, the Chow test gives exactly the same results of T tests, right, erm  we won't bother going through it, if you want to go through this er sheet in your own time calculate that, that Chow test and essentially what it involves is splitting with the s the whole sample now into two sub-samples, right, the first sub-sample, right, is peacetime, the second sub-sample wartime, right, and you just compare the residual sum of the squares on the unaccounted for variation, right, between actual and fitted values, just compare the residual sum of squares between these two sub periods, right and if you use the formula that's given there that will come out with exactly the same result, well in actual fact you can square, if you square the F statistic you get  calculating one formula you will get T value, got from er the computer  right, the er, the sheet goes on to say how we can er use dummy variables in slightly more complicated ways, right, we could see actually see whether the income or price elasticities of demand changed.<endOfText>
<human>Right, instead of letting the intercept change we could just let er our elasticities change.<endOfText>
<bot>Anyway  that's preferable because that's actually what's, what's happening, right, the war is likely to affect the elasticities of demand rather than this er bizarre concept intercept erm and the, the sheet on page three tells you how, how to do that  okay.<endOfText>
<human>But essentially all these tests do the same thing because they're seeing whether the parameters that we estimate over the entire sample are robust over all sub-samples, right, we can't, we wouldn't bother testing over all sub-samples though we can do, it's just if we have good reason to believe that behaviour in one sub-sample  different for behaviour in another E G use er Chow test or equivalently a dummy variable on the intercept to see whether there was any change.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, okay we'll leave it there, if you just press the escape key and then work your way out of Microfit towards the action menu, exit from Microfit and don't forget to log out of the network.<endOfText>
<human>Okay, feel free to come down here at any time with this sheet and er going through the, the examples in greater detail Q M four FIT was the data file, you'll always be able to access, right  when you've logged out of the network feel free to go and a merry Christmas, see you next year.<endOfText>
<bot><endOfText>
<human>Oh.<endOfText>
<bot>You can ask him if it's alright to keep you in your tablets.<endOfText>
<human>I'm going to start .<endOfText>
<bot>I tell you when I was in here it was just keeping calm.<endOfText>
<human>And I'd no been to  bloody.<endOfText>
<bot>Aye well  Nothing Doctor  can do,<endOfText>
<human>I know but he .<endOfText>
<bot>He would need to go up and see .<endOfText>
<human>Doctor <endOfText>
<bot>Ah.<endOfText>
<human>What's up with young John today?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh my  Strathclyde Hospital on Wednesday,<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>and they er sort of X-rayed me, took a urine sample, took a blood sample, er Doctor<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>He examined me.<endOfText>
<human>Erm he f he found, know how they were wrong about a slight murmur on my heart?<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>He couldn't find it.<endOfText>
<bot>He says it could have been  anxiety<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>or <endOfText>
<human>hospital<endOfText>
<bot>Aye just<endOfText>
<human>So there was nothing really <endOfText>
<bot>nothing to worry about.<endOfText>
<human>Good.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm delighted to hear that.<endOfText>
<human>But he did say that er it'll take three weeks before he can get back to me about sending me to the Law  <endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>He says that, see the biopsy and the other?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>He says that I might not need to get it right?<endOfText>
<bot>Because he, he'll be able to tell off my blood.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>So he, he's still to decide about that.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Aye, and he also agreed with you about the lump in my back.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>Right?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And he s he said the same as you, that er<endOfText>
<bot>If it's not bothering you, leave it alone.<endOfText>
<human>Aye.<endOfText>
<bot>Said the exact same as you.<endOfText>
<human>Oh aye.<endOfText>
<bot>Och aye.<endOfText>
<human>It's not, not sensible.<endOfText>
<bot>Now then.<endOfText>
<human>Here you are young John.<endOfText>
<bot>Honestly, I'm gutted with this cold the noo, could you give me<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah,<endOfText>
<human>something for it?<endOfText>
<bot>sure.<endOfText>

<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>I have my good days and bad days.<endOfText>
<bot>How many good ones and how bad ones?<endOfText>
<human>during the day.<endOfText>
<bot>Too many bad ones.<endOfText>
<human>I just cannae seem to get off it at all.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, keep it down as low as you can because the lower you keep it, the less chance there is of getting this biopsy done.<endOfText>
<human>I thought they were just going to X-ray me back, but they X-rayed everything.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh they would do.<endOfText>
<human>They done the lot,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>front, back, side.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Oh aye.<endOfText>
<bot>There you are John, And <endOfText>

<bot>I'm scared to  too<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>too many at the one you know what I mean?<endOfText>
<bot>He's seeing Doctor  and<endOfText>
<human>I was wondering if you'd heard anything from Doctor  ?<endOfText>
<bot>Doctor   what, if that happens Doctor  says that the next time he wants to see us along with him.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Because he's worrying us.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>See I don't know if it's just part real  or if he's just trying to frighten me.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>It could be.<endOfText>
<bot>This i this is the thing, with youngsters like that, you never know.<endOfText>
<human>I mean he doesn't want for nothing, he gets as much as I can give him.<endOfText>
<bot>It's nothing it's nothing to do <endOfText>
<human>He's got, he's got everything he could want.<endOfText>
<bot>Aye, it's nothing to do with wanting.<endOfText>
<human>I mean see my see my next door neighbours, they're good<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>neighbours aren't they?<endOfText>
<bot>We don't even take any money off him for keep <endOfText>
<human>Aye.<endOfText>
<bot>or anything like that.<endOfText>
<human>And he came in<endOfText>
<bot>let him keep everything.<endOfText>
<human>he's sitting he's sitting in the living room on Sunday night.<endOfText>
<bot>Now these new wheely-bins, you take a turn each.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll just take the two, and Billy'll take them out the next week.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>But on Sunday night we weren't in, and Billy looked in the kitchen.<endOfText>
<human>We were at a night out.<endOfText>
<bot>He must have looked in the kitchen window.<endOfText>
<human>Just to see<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>whether to take the bins out or not.<endOfText>
<bot>But our John was sitting reading the paper.<endOfText>
<human>He's got a, they're all talking about me, he says they're listening at the walls or standing in the clossies <endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>I mean the things he's coming away with aren't real.<endOfText>
<bot>Aye.<endOfText>
<human>Why is he seeing Doctor  ?<endOfText>
<bot>He's .<endOfText>
<human>He's gonna see him again, don't get me wrong, Doctor  said he'll send for the both of us, right?<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>But he's getting to the point where I'm ready for saying to him away you go down to your granny's right, but my mam cannae live with him either.<endOfText>
<bot>No no.<endOfText>
<human>Cos she's the same way.<endOfText>
<bot>She's phoning me.<endOfText>

<human>Oh no.<endOfText>

<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Every week.<endOfText>
<human>Is it every week?<endOfText>

<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>I thought it was only once a month.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>See when he's thing, you see when he's er down at his granny's, my mummy and my daddy are actually talking round about him trying to kid on that they're, they're ignoring him.<endOfText>
<human>They they try to ignore him.<endOfText>

<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>I'll get on to him and we'll soon get this .<endOfText>
<bot>See I cannae walk by a bus stop.<endOfText>
<human>There're two people at a bus stop, they two people's talking about him.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>The night that they brought him up here.<endOfText>
<bot>A man walked in and he says hello to John and that and how's it going and that, he came into see you and I sat, I mean I came in <endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>out of the road, what's that man saying about me?<endOfText>
<human>Aye I heard him saying how do you put up with an arsehole like that?<endOfText>
<bot>Thinks, he's paranoid.<endOfText>
<human>He thinks everybody's talking about him.<endOfText>
<bot>Aye.<endOfText>
<human>You know what I mean?<endOfText>
<bot>But this has just come on.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh aye.<endOfText>
<human>This is how it comes.<endOfText>
<bot>This is how it comes, just<endOfText>
<human>And I mean  I'm not wanting to make up any .<endOfText>
<bot>Ah but Doctor , it's plain to you, John's <endOfText>
<human>It may be the best thing for him.<endOfText>
<bot>John has been  put under psychologist because he was slow at school right?<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>Aye.<endOfText>
<human>And this is the start.<endOfText>
<bot>This is what's in his head.<endOfText>
<human>He's no equal with anybody else.<endOfText>
<bot>Yet <endOfText>
<human>Ah.<endOfText>
<bot>he is cos we paid dear.<endOfText>
<human>Yes yes yes.<endOfText>
<bot>But this is the thing, if he doesn't go there, if he needs to go there and he doesn't go there, he's going to get worse.<endOfText>
<human>Aye.<endOfText>
<bot>Aye.<endOfText>
<human>I mean he's going to get worse and worse and worse.<endOfText>
<bot>See, the way I feel I've, it's not a case<endOfText>
<human>She even thinks<endOfText>
<bot>I know there was  <endOfText>
<human>see because he w he was slow, he had trouble with learning <endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>at school, right?<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>See he  <endOfText>
<bot>S he thinks that all the ones that were at school with him are s talking <endOfText>
<human>about him.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>That's right <endOfText>
<bot>Still yet.<endOfText>
<human>that's what he said, the first night he came in.<endOfText>
<bot>Aye.<endOfText>
<human>The f the thing is if he needs to go in for treatment, he's only going to get worse if he doesn't get it.<endOfText>
<bot>But he'll say to me <endOfText>
<human>I said that and all.<endOfText>
<bot>But as I, like you know John when he talks about it.<endOfText>
<human>If they found out <endOfText>
<bot>I'm up there like I'm just going to stay up there, I'm never mind to come back here.<endOfText>
<human>Do you know, she went to the bingo yesterday  her mother, right?<endOfText>
<bot>For that day out at the bingo with her mam.<endOfText>
<human>And er he roa er he ranted for three hours too.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>Kept repeating himself and, right?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And I'm sitting watching the telly trying to watch a film.<endOfText>
<bot>Tell him what happened with the police <endOfText>
<human>the police a fortnight ago.<endOfText>
<bot>I had to send for the police.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Because he didn't <endOfText>
<human>I thought he was I thought he was going to do something to himself.<endOfText>
<bot>Or smash up the house or something.<endOfText>
<human>See he smashed up the house on Christmas day.<endOfText>
<bot>Aha.<endOfText>
<human>But he never <endOfText>
<bot>For no reason at all,<endOfText>
<human>Aye.<endOfText>
<bot>right.<endOfText>
<human>Er then he, he, I sent for the police because he walked out the door and he, he threatened to kill himself.<endOfText>
<bot>I had to get the police to get him back.<endOfText>
<human>See and I don't know whether he's tormenting us, or whether he's<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, you never know.<endOfText>
<human>You cannae take the chance.<endOfText>
<bot>And I've got every tablet.<endOfText>
<human>Even his.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>I've got  of them all.<endOfText>
<bot>You can't, I mean there's, there's no way you can take a chance on it, Flora.<endOfText>
<human>I mean if he's just  <endOfText>
<bot>I mean he's, he's the only kid we've got, and he's been <endOfText>
<human>Aye.<endOfText>
<bot>spoilt, you know what I mean?<endOfText>
<human>It's no as if we've <endOfText>
<bot>Doesn't, doesn't matter who it is.<endOfText>
<human>Doesn't matter what age they are.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, we've had them doing this at eight year old.<endOfText>
<human>Aye.<endOfText>
<bot>And I've seen them doing this right up till they're in their eighties.<endOfText>
<human>Do you think if I, do you think if I gave him a fright,s see the, time he says he's going off to his granny's and I say away you go, and my mam says she's not taking him.<endOfText>
<bot>Would you would you like to take the chance?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>I wouldn't either.<endOfText>
<human>I know he's starting all these things, see his computers and that?<endOfText>
<bot>S maybe if I says to him away you go to your granny's and then and you're not taking anything with you.<endOfText>
<human>No?<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>It's not worth the risk Flora.<endOfText>
<bot>If he did anything<endOfText>
<human>Well that night he walked out I was  wasn't I?<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>And he must have been, I've a feeling he was standing somewhere bloody well<endOfText>
<bot>Watching you.<endOfText>
<human>Aye.<endOfText>
<bot>watching me.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh aye.<endOfText>
<human>I mean,i if he, if you said something like that to him and he went away and he didn't turn up for two or three days, you would never live with yourself.<endOfText>
<bot>Maybe that <endOfText>
<human>Exactly.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh no.<endOfText>
<human>No no.<endOfText>
<bot>Ju hold on.<endOfText>
<human>Leave it with me.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll get in touch with Doctor .<endOfText>
<human>Hope we'll get it organized as quick as we can.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, thanks Doctor .<endOfText>
<human>Okay?<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Right, thanks Doctor.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, right Flora.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Don't do anything<endOfText>
<human>I wouldn't.<endOfText>
<bot>Aye.<endOfText>
<human>o okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Right then.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, cheerio now.<endOfText>
<human><endOfText>
<bot>Er, before we start, I would like to say that we have received a request er, I think it was from Longman Dic tories er Dictionaries to have er, one of our meetings recorded, and er, after discussing with the leader of the Council, er and er we decided that that this may be the best committee to record.<endOfText>
<human>Basically, what it is, they er, want to to computerise a collection of some one hundred million words of written and spoken text, that can used by dictionary compilers which are there just to study the English language.<endOfText>
<bot>It is all completely confidential.<endOfText>
<human>No individuals will be identified, and really it's for the future, er, so you, there may be the opportunity of er, new words, recorded.<endOfText>
<bot>so, er, with your approval, er Graham has got the er recording aid.<endOfText>
<human>There's either one here, where else are they, Graham.<endOfText>
<bot>That's the only, that's the only one.<endOfText>
<human>Is that the only one.<endOfText>
<bot>I was assured that it will pick everybody up.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, just to mention, also, Chair, it, they've asked to deal with the Personnel Sub-Committee Meeting next week as well.<endOfText>
<bot>I see.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you, so we've obviously got to behave ourselves this morning, and act in a proper manner.<endOfText>
<bot>shout out <endOfText>
<human>Well, I'll turn it that way.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, so first of all, could we have er, any apologies or substitutes for this meeting.<endOfText>
<human>Chair, there are no apologies for this meeting, that I know of <endOfText>
<bot>Thank you.<endOfText>
<human>The er, first item on the agenda is the minutes of a meeting, fifteenth of October.<endOfText>
<bot>Can I have your approval of those minutes?<endOfText>
<human>Good.<endOfText>
<bot>Agreed.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>The next paper is cash limits, and I believe you're going to take this on.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, er, thank you Chair.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll say if I knew any Swahili, I was very tempted to s I would would have been very tempted to to use it, in the lights of the er, the dictionary.<endOfText>
<human>Er, the the first paper is the er, is the beautiful category in the paper, allocations from the contingency.<endOfText>
<bot>There are three erm, categories to er the requests for allocations for this meeting, erm, the balance of the contingency currently, is one point seven two nine million pounds.<endOfText>
<human>And if the er, requests for approval er, are indeed a a approved, the balance er, remaining for the contingency will be some four hundred and seventy five thousand pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>The recommendations on the front page, to show the three categories.<endOfText>
<human>The first category all relates to er related pay awards.<endOfText>
<bot>All pay awards are, have been settled at one and a half per cent, and I don't propose to go into any of the the detail.<endOfText>
<human>The figures er, for each er, of the settlements, er is shown in the more detailed erm, paper.<endOfText>
<bot>I will make brief comments, Chair, on the the two other remainings items, and if I may refer members to the more detailed paper, and firstly to section three, capital accounting by local authorities.<endOfText>
<human>Best local authority accounting practice is er, contained within the code of practice on local authority accounting, erm, which is, is, er, published and maintained by the .<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, that is, is has been revised with effect from the first of April, nineteen-ninety-four, to incorporate proposals for a new system of capital accounting.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, the code does have the force of law, er, and requires local authorities to adopt the new capital accounting system from April nineteen ninety-four.<endOfText>
<bot>Preparation for the new accounting, capital accounting system, required all our assets to be valued.<endOfText>
<human>Currently the er, the County Council's assets, as shown in the balance sheet, have a value of twenty-nine million pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>Now that of course, is way below the actual value of those assets, er, but it's still over twenty-nine millions because of the previous way in which, erm, the er, capital capital was accounted for.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, we need to value those assets, and the cost of back- work being carried out by the London Buildings Consultancy would be nineteen thousand pounds, some twenty pounds per property.<endOfText>
<bot>There's no budget provision, and as a consequence approval is being sought for that some to come from the contingency.<endOfText>
<human>The er, moving on to section four, waste disposal.<endOfText>
<bot>The contingency originally had provision for some four thousand pounds for waste disposal.<endOfText>
<human>That provision was placed in the contingency because it was un felt it was unclear at the time, what the effect on costs would be, of the sale of link waste.<endOfText>
<bot>In fact, er, an estimated one hundred and sixty three, six forty pounds is required, erm, following on from the sale of link waste, and of that eighty-five thousand pounds wa relates to the legal costs associated with the sale.<endOfText>
<human>It seems that there a a a large figure.<endOfText>
<bot>It is a large figure, but the County Council was breaking er, new ground in the sale of link waste, and it was necessary to engage specialist lawyers, erm,Lond a firm of er, London solicitors er, to assist in the in the process, and members will recall that in fact, the the proceeds from the sale of link waste were four point two million pounds initially, with potentially another four hundred thousand pounds, erm, once certain conditions were satisfied.<endOfText>
<human>In addition to that, another one hundred and eighty thousand pounds is required for the on- going maintenance of some closed sites dealing with  problems and and also to some legal and consultancy fees in connection with a an after-care dispute.<endOfText>
<bot>So the total of the four hundred and fifty thousand pounds that is now being requested, it's three hundred and forty-three forty.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, and it is, erm the waste disposal sub-committee did resolve at their meeting erm, earlier this month, to request the finance sub- committee to make er, an allocation.<endOfText>
<bot>If er, members approve the three er, categories of allocation, there will as I said earlier, be four hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds left in the contingency.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you Chair.<endOfText>
<bot>Any comments.<endOfText>
<human>Er, could we just ask er, a couple of questions, Mr Chairman.<endOfText>
<bot>Is that four seventy-five likely to survive  there be any more calls on it.<endOfText>
<human>That's the first question.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, the second question is, if you hadn't put inflation in this year,<endOfText>
<human>Yes, the er, in answer to the er, the the first point,I do not, er, expect there to be many additional calls on the remaining, on the remainder of the contingency.<endOfText>
<bot>There may be some, but I would expect that this time sum, er or close to it, will be the final balance, and that, of course, will flow into the general balances of the County Council, and er, a one million pounds was allocated from the contingency, that finance sub-committee in October, to meet the  price, er, to meet a prices inflation.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>No other comments?<endOfText>
<human>You  agreed  on the recommendations<endOfText>
<bot>Agreed.<endOfText>
<human>Agreed.<endOfText>
<bot>Agreed.<endOfText>
<human>Good.<endOfText>
<bot>Paper B. <endOfText>
<human>Thank you, Chair.<endOfText>
<bot>This paper deals with those er non-target area, er projects.<endOfText>
<human>In other words, projects which are not contained within erm, service committee targets.<endOfText>
<bot>There are some seven in total, and I'll briefly refer to those.<endOfText>
<human>The first one, turning over the page, relates to er, grant maintained schools, erm, the fact that erm, the calculation of the indirect maintenance grant is based on last year's percentages.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, so, instead of paying for primary schools, eleven point nine per cent, which is the the actual er amount of er indirect support that is provided within the erm, Education Department, and seven that's in relation to primary schools, and seven point eight per cent schools.<endOfText>
<human>We have to pay the, er, ninety two, three percentages, which were fifteen point two per cent and nine point eight per cent, so there's an additional element there, and also we have to deal with erm, the additional cash that goes to grant maintained schools, who went grant maintained prior to the first of April nineteen ninety-two.<endOfText>
<bot>They are protected at the cash additions that they had er,or originally and they are somewhat higher than the erm, actual, erm, indirect per percentages would be.<endOfText>
<human>The estimate for ninety=four, ninety- five, is that there will be some one point three eight five million pounds required, but I er, have to say, that we have not, as in previous years, we have not at this stage received from the D F E er, details of of how the er indirect element of A N G will be calculated for next year, so the requirement may differ er in in due time.<endOfText>
<bot>Section three, deals with police and fire pensions.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, the revised estimate for police pensions is some hundred and nineteen thousand pounds higher than the original estimate.<endOfText>
<bot>Now that is not as significant an increase as we've had in previous years.<endOfText>
<human>There are greater additions to expenditure than that, but there, that has been in part off-set by er, a greater er er receipt from other authorities in relating to er policemen transferring to Lincolnshire.<endOfText>
<bot>As far as ninety four, five is concerned, erm the, er estimate is some six hundred and eighty- one thousand pounds higher than the the original estimate for this year, and again, there is a mix of factors giving rise to to that.<endOfText>
<human>As far as fire-fighters pensions is concerned, the revised estimate is is really significantly higher than the original estimate.<endOfText>
<bot>Over half a million pounds, and there are three factors that make er up that er sum, a hundred and eighty thousand pounds for the lump sum payment, erm, transfers out to other authorities, that's fire-fighters transferring to other authorities fire services.<endOfText>
<human>Two hundred and thirty-one thousand, and we had lower than ex expected receipts from fight-fighters transferring in to Lincolnshire.<endOfText>
<bot>In total, we estimate that next year, police and fire pensions will cost, gross, nearly seven and a half million pounds.<endOfText>
<human>So that, that is a very significant increase on the fi on the amount that er, fairly recently we were having to pay.<endOfText>
<bot>The next item, specific grants, deals in in main part with specific grant on the police pensions er, element.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, but it also deals with erm, police claim office grant on C C that is charged to the police and repair and maintenance, and also related to one or two minor items.<endOfText>
<bot>Some specific grant on the judges lodgings, the maintenance of that, payable by the Lord Chancellors Department, and so- some specific grant on emergency planning.<endOfText>
<human>That's spec this is the final year in which specific grant will be payable on emergency planning.<endOfText>
<bot>The er, revised estimate is one one hundred and fifty thousand pounds higher than the original estimate, and we're expecting over three hundred thousand pounds into the specific grant and ninety-four ninety- five.<endOfText>
<human>The next  deals with precepts and the the major precept is that which is paid to the Lincolnshire Floor Defence Committee.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, we've got initially some slightly bad news on this, but then some really rather encouraging news.<endOfText>
<human>The er, the downside, is that the way of apportioning and contributions to flood defence committees has changed as a result of the introduction of the er, of the council tax.<endOfText>
<bot>Previously, er, our share depended upon er the population of Lincolnshire as a proportion of the total   area.<endOfText>
<human>The basis of apportion which is now the council tax base, and we er, do lose slightly from that change.<endOfText>
<bot>Section five point two, makes reference to the additional a hundred and ten thousand pounds that was approved in October for erm, er expected budget pressures, in this particular area, and in fact, we have had an eleven thousand pounds refund  refund from the Severn Trent er Flood Defence Committee, so there's only ninety- nine thousand pounds, er the revised estimate is ninety-nine thousand above the original estimate.<endOfText>
<human>Now turning to the, the the good news and that is that the Lincolnshire Flood Defence Committee was set to increase after  ninety-four, five which is some twenty per cent below the normal three-four level.<endOfText>
<bot>That, the increa there is an increase over the Wellent er Flood Defence, Wellent and  Flood Defence Committee, two and a half per cent, but that as Severn Trent, is set at a zero increase.<endOfText>
<human>So the overall  effect on these budgets is that the original estimate is just over seven hundred thousand pounds, the original estimate for ninety four-five is just over seven hundred thousand pounds below the original estimate for ninety-three, ninety-four.<endOfText>
<bot>Section Six deals with mandatory student awards where the county council acts, if you like, as the administrator on behalf of the the Government, with the payment of student awards.<endOfText>
<human>It's expenditure out and then income in from the Government.<endOfText>
<bot>The, perhaps the the points to make there, is that the bigger the ninety-four, five is er, getting on for four million pounds below the ninety-three, four level, and that reflects, firstly, a reduction in students grants, with a a corresponding increase in the amount available from student loans, and secondly, a reduction in the tuition fees payable as part of the mandatory award, er, in the light of direct, higher direct funding of higher education establishments.<endOfText>
<human>Now this,is er, also,and this is to do with the interest earned and on revenue balances.<endOfText>
<bot>The est estimates for er, interest on revenue balances, depends upon anticipating cash flows.<endOfText>
<human>The cash into the authority, the timing of that, and the ti the timing of cash going out of the authority.<endOfText>
<bot>A particular difficulty in trying to estimate the ninety-three, four er position, was erm, stemmed from er, the independence of further education colleges.<endOfText>
<human>We were not sure how that would affect the cash flows of the authority, and set a very er cautious level for interest on revenue balances, and as members can see, that has been very well exceeded, er its superseded by some one point one million pounds in ninety-three, four and it's expected to be of a similar level in ninety-four, ninety-five.<endOfText>
<bot>And, finally, Chair, the the last section, C C within committee budget, erm, this area is where the the costs of providing the central department is recharged to other departments.<endOfText>
<human>There's a higher revised estimate, and a higher original estimate for next year, er, that is to do with charging C C to the probation committee, erm, which previously was er,ex excluded, and that is er, of course subjected within the the probation committee cash limit and eighty per cent grant is payable on any sums within that.<endOfText>
<bot>As far as the public service units are concerned, er, where the amount of C C is a real charge, and can dis disad er disadvantage them significantly, erm, the ninety-two, three charges are reduced by ten per cent, erm, it it it's expected there'll be a further two per cent reduction, so there's a twelve per cent reduction in the C C charges to the public service units.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you, Chairman.<endOfText>
<bot>The report is for noting.<endOfText>
<human>that they're rather interested in the information contained in it.<endOfText>
<bot>Just concerned about, you know, we don't know really what the er impact of the grant maintained, er er er er and how how quickly we we we we know what what that is, er er Treasurer, please.<endOfText>
<human>Chair, I I don't know, er er, last year, we were in a a similar position.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>The January meeting of this committee, we didn't know what the arrangements would be.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I think we got to know around mid-February.<endOfText>
<bot>So, if if the same pattern is followed, it would be middle of February, before we we we find out what the arrangements will be.<endOfText>
<human>The amount of money that we have to pay out, is er obviously detract from the education budget.<endOfText>
<bot>On on on that Chair, I think erm, the protection of of the schools that went grant maintained before ninety-two, I think that will continue.<endOfText>
<human>But certainly, some progress is being made towards the common funding formula.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>And the financial incentives er, to go grant maintained are rapidly decreasing.<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor <endOfText>
<human>I do hope we're not going to extend our current lawyers who we use in this particular issue, erm, whatever this amount of money is, is spent in  school  and er, to that extent I think we should er be well prepared to foot the bill.<endOfText>
<bot>Chairman, I think the Chair of Education's comments were bias.<endOfText>
<human>It has nothing to do with the individual grant maintained schools.<endOfText>
<bot>What we have to realise, it is taking a disproportion of money, amount of money, out of Lincolnshire's education budget.<endOfText>
<human>This this is the concern, and we all know how tight that budge is, and how much we need to put into education accounts.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, I think that the comments that Chair made ar are extremely  bias, in what she's saying, I think is, that it looks as if , if erm, the minister is beginning to realise this simply can't go on, this this disproportionate funding, and that is what is so unfair, and I think it does need to make quite clear to grant maintained schools, that there is, it, there is that possibility that that will be reduced, because they need to know that just as well , for balancing their own budgets in the future.<endOfText>
<human>Any comments.<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor <endOfText>
<human>Was not, as it were, that's the way the treasurer would use  balancing, you've got another million pounds in the .<endOfText>
<bot>Mind you, I did think last year the grant was down too low, at eight hundred thousand, but that was the amount they put in, it was two point eight, I think, to start with, and two million pounds offered in the end.<endOfText>
<human>Which made our budget er, that problem obviously that much more difficult and just showed the problems we live with, Mr Chairman.<endOfText>
<bot>Which can produce the budget within the guide lines, as we found with interest rates.<endOfText>
<human>Pleased you raised that, Councillor , 'cos we're still two million short than the government assessment within the S S A. <endOfText>
<bot>Yes, that's right.<endOfText>
<human>Which er, you know, adds to the doubt, you're obviously aware of the <endOfText>
<bot>Thank you.<endOfText>
<human>As I say, the er, it is, it is two million less, than what the government has assessed we should be receiving in interest payments.<endOfText>
<bot>Just commenting on the er, grant maintained schools.<endOfText>
<human>It's not a case of being paranoid, it's a case of seeking fairness for all the school children, and then some of them receiving disproportional, you know higher, er amounts of money, then that must be seen to be unfair, and I'm certainly well supported in that.<endOfText>
<bot>Are there any other comments on this paper?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I just er, like to, just to welcome the ongoing commitment to the Treasurers Department, to keep down the er, charges to the public service units through C E C. Obviously this is to the benefit, and gives them the, a greater chance of succeeding out there, in what is a difficult market place.<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor <endOfText>
<human>Er, thank you, Mr Chairman, to me erm, this went on from the first paper that chose the effects of the food and management of the er, the fire  local services, whereas  carried through and it will be interesting to see next year er what the situation is, in order to  the position of the  as it were, this year, benefit of everything that has  previous administration.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, we've already got some information from Central Government, that that we're ten million short.<endOfText>
<human>on the Government.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm sorry, you know, you've had your say.<endOfText>
<human>Any other comments.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Give me er, note of the recommendation.<endOfText>
<bot>Paper C is the revenue estimates.<endOfText>
<human>I believe you were taking this Paul.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, thank you thank you, Chair.<endOfText>
<human>This paper seeks your approval for the revised estimate for the current financial year, nineteen ninety-three, ninety-four, and the for estimates nineteen ninety-four, ninety-five, for the policy commission.<endOfText>
<bot>It also seeks your approval to the  which has been undertaken by respective chief officers, during the current financial year, in which, is why I'm reporting to you now in accordance with the national regulations.<endOfText>
<human>The report itself was in the usual format comprising a report by the county treasurer, a joint report by the chief executive and county treasurer, and then the detailed estimate contained on the blue pages.<endOfText>
<bot>But let's propose a statement, which through the county treasurer's report in any detail today, it's already been to all service committees and I'm sure you're very familiar with it's contents.<endOfText>
<human>What I will do, however, is just draw your attention to two key issues within that report, which affect the estimates of this committee.<endOfText>
<bot>Having turned then to   page A two.<endOfText>
<human>Starting at page A two, paragraph five and nine indicate that there is presently a gap of so of some eleven point four million pounds, between the overall spending limits of three hundred and eighty-one point four million pounds, agreed by the Policy Committee last November, and the provisional cutting limits set by the Government of three hundred and seventy million pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>At it's meeting last November, the Policy Committee did agree to review the overall spending limits in the light of the final revenue Support Claim Settlement.<endOfText>
<human>And the outcome of that that that review will be reported to its next meeting on the eighth of February.<endOfText>
<bot>Should the review require an adjustment to this committee's target, a further report will be made at the next meeting of this committee on any amendment to that target.<endOfText>
<human>The second matter, I would just like to draw your attention to briefly, er, within the treasurer's report, is in paragraph eight.<endOfText>
<bot>This explains how the target for this committee is being set.<endOfText>
<human>As for all other committees, the target for this committee, for nineteen ninety-four, ninety-five, allows fully for the effect of inflation from November nineteen ninety-two to November ninety-three.<endOfText>
<bot>That being the price fixed at which the   was presented.<endOfText>
<human>It allows fully also, for known commitments in service.<endOfText>
<bot>The effect of forward inflation, that's inflation which will be incurred during nineteen ninety-four, ninety-five, is not incorporated in this estimate.<endOfText>
<human>It will be considered by the Policy Committee again, at it's meeting in February.<endOfText>
<bot>In summary, therefore, the estimates before you, er for the Policy Committee, represent the cost of maintaining existing policies and levels of service.<endOfText>
<human>If I could turn now, to the joint report of the Chief Executive  and the County Treasurer.<endOfText>
<bot>This is set out on on page of B one to to B three.<endOfText>
<human>Page B one covers the er estimate from the Chief Executive's Department.<endOfText>
<bot>Detailed revised budget target of two point one five nine million pounds is set out in paragraph two, and you'll note that  the main addition to the estimate approved by the County Council last February of one point eight, nine, two.<endOfText>
<human>The County Hall Department are spending from nineteen ninety-two, ninety-three,this amounted to a hundred and eighty thousand four hundred and ten pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>Further addition has been made of seventy two thousand pounds for service and negatives, introduced by the Department bill, and approved by the Policy Committee last June.<endOfText>
<human>Paragraphs five to seven, explain the compositions the nineteen ninety-four and ninety-five target of tw two point oh, one eight million pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>This again, starts with the original estimate for nineteen ninety-three, ninety-four, of one point eight nine two million pounds, and details of changes agreed by the Policy Committee last November.<endOfText>
<human>This allows for repricing of the budget for November, nineteen ninety-two, to November nineteen ninety-three, and that sum is shown there as some fifty- seven thousand pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>This includes, also, an amount of thirteen thousand five hundred, er to support the scheme for public questions, which was approved by the Policy Committee last November.<endOfText>
<human>If we turn now, to page B two,this presents the information for the County Treasurer's Department for the same format.<endOfText>
<bot>For those of nineteen ninety- three, ninety-four, and nineteen ninety-four and ninety-five.<endOfText>
<human>Starting with nineteen ninety-three, ninety-four.<endOfText>
<bot>Again, the main additions of the original estimate is that the carried forward of two hundred and forty-four thousand pounds from nineteen ninety-two, ninety-three.<endOfText>
<human>And approval for this was given by this Committee last October.<endOfText>
<bot>Paragraph eleven, detailed for your approval of  from income generated by re- charges to internal funds.<endOfText>
<human>And this is being used to fund the cost of the Risk Manager post.<endOfText>
<bot>Again this was reported to you at the last meeting of this Committee.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, and also the cost of increased fidelity guarantee insurance of eleven thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds, and additional suppliers and services costs, principally in respect of consultancy costs arising out of the Inland Revenue Audit of twelve thousand, seven hundred and fifty pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>Turning to nineteen ninety-four, ninety-five, er, paragraph thirteen, details of budget target of two point five, four, oh, million pounds.<endOfText>
<human>The main addition to the original estimate in the in the case of nineteen ninety-four, ninety-five being the cost of repricing from the November ninety- two price costs, to November nineteen ninety-three, at seven hundred and one thousand pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>Moving on, erm, paragraphs fifteen to twenty-one,com cover a number of miscellaneous budgets under the wing of the Policy Committee, detailed, described as other policy.<endOfText>
<human>Paragraph sixteen explains the revised target of one point one one seven million pounds, which mak , which makes provisioning for the costs in the current year of operating the university company.<endOfText>
<bot>These costs amounting to some, seventy thousand pounds in nineteen ninety-three, ninety- four.<endOfText>
<human>It also makes provisions for meeting redundancy costs within public service units, in respect of work which they have lost in competition.<endOfText>
<bot>Paragraph eighteen, makes reference to the receipt of fifty-three thousand pounds of income.<endOfText>
<human>This is the County Council's share of the expose surplus for nineteen ninety- two, ninety-three.<endOfText>
<bot>It also points out in in in in the report, that this income has been  to meet expenditure of thirty-two thousand pounds for the number of services, and the remainder of this, has been  with additional insurance costs.<endOfText>
<human>Paragraph twenty, provides details of the nineteen ninety-four, ninety-five budget target  policy.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Which was reported in paragraph twenty-one, includes a reduction of two hundred and thirty-two thousand two hundred pounds for the cost of the nineteen ninety-three County Council elections.<endOfText>
<bot>And this reduction was partially off-set by the costs of a hundred and thirty-one thousand pounds, again the the cost, this being the cost of operating a university company in nineteen ninety-four, ninety-five.<endOfText>
<human>Finally, Chair, if I can just ask members to turn briefly to page C one, the first blue page.<endOfText>
<bot>This page summarises the service area under, within the Policy Committee.<endOfText>
<human>The original estimate nineteen ninety-three, ninety-four, that's shown in column three,<endOfText>
<bot>It then provides analysis of inflation and other changes, leading to both revised estimates for nineteen ninety-three, ninety-four and the estimate for nineteen ninety-four, ninety- five.<endOfText>
<human>For this committee, therefore  Severn we've been asked to approve a revised estimate of five point nine five five million pounds, and an estimate next year of five point four, six, seven million pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>Details of these estimates is is provided in pages C two to C eleven, and I don't propose to go through those in any detail.<endOfText>
<human>But I'll be quite happy to answer any questions that members have.<endOfText>
<bot>The recommendations, Chair, that you approve the estimate for, the revised estimate for nineteen ninety-three, ninety-four.<endOfText>
<human>The estimates for nineteen ninety-four, ninety-five, and the guidelines set out in the report for nineteen ninety-three, ninety-four.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you..<endOfText>
<human>Do you agree with those?<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor <endOfText>
<human>I wouldn't know.<endOfText>
<bot>People were coming in with questions on our first  little bit hesitant  debate.<endOfText>
<human>This is er, a relatively er, small revenue er budget compared to er, the Service Committee's  recent week.<endOfText>
<bot>Nevertheless, it is erm, set once again, in the er context of the overall County Council budget proposal for next year being three hundred and eighty one million pound.<endOfText>
<human>That was an overall estimate that erm, members on this side, apposed very vigorously when it was first put forward in policy, and  that any budget er, proposals put to committees that er, based on that false premise, erm, would also er be criticised and erm, opposed by this side.<endOfText>
<bot>It takes no account of the er er government requirements for er this coming year, and having said that, I I must accept that the overall increase proposed for erm, ninety- four, five, er is only three point three per cent.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, only three point three per cent.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, in my sums that comes to er, something like er, fifty per cent more than it ought to be.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, and if we look at individual erm, items.<endOfText>
<bot>When we look at the Chief Executives Department, the increase there is what, six point six per cent overall.<endOfText>
<human>That's a factor of something like three hundred per cent than it, than it ought to be in terms of inflation and the County Treasurer's budget of plus five per cent which is well in excess of two hundred per cent.<endOfText>
<bot>So I think you can see that erm, there is er, not a very strong basis there for this er budget to be promoted by this side.<endOfText>
<human>We oppose it.<endOfText>
<bot>You wish to put forward any amendments to the way you have put.<endOfText>
<human>I I I I think the amendment will be slope opposite to the er, to the recommendations, I don't think it requires an amendment.<endOfText>
<bot>Without any information as to where, how you would reduce it.<endOfText>
<human>I think  No .<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, fine.<endOfText>
<human>The principles underlined, document,this project are er coarse, you would say, and for that reason we oppose it.<endOfText>
<bot>Good.<endOfText>
<human>Mr Chairman, if we come in now,million pounds <endOfText>
<bot>Oh, is that, is that proposal seconded, first.<endOfText>
<human>It is.<endOfText>
<bot>It has been seconded.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Now that's stated in the blue paper, you might want to talk about <endOfText>
<human>Well, you've got the opportunity now, if you wish.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, it's the case of <endOfText>
<human>I'm sorry, I'm chairing the meeting.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm sorry,yo yo you you're not listening to me.<endOfText>
<human>I am listening to you.<endOfText>
<bot>The the the treasurer has already gone through the report.<endOfText>
<human>It is now up to members, to make observations, ask questions, and then an amendment has been put, which is er, accompanied to, direct negative over the recommendations.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, the Treasurer, is responsible at the end of the day for reducing  the price of overall.<endOfText>
<human>So the question that I would like to ask the Treasurer, and the statement was made by  been allowed.<endOfText>
<bot>Has there been any attempt by anybody to  real budget  or has<endOfText>
<human>there been  in the department, just  put them together, their demands and  each of them papers.<endOfText>
<bot>Chief Exec. up six per cent, Treasurer Department the same.<endOfText>
<human>No doubt this goes through.<endOfText>
<bot>Education the other day was up about five or six per cent.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, I'm gonna protest, because I'm gonna vote a protest  and commitments are  area where some will be allowed and some won't be allowed.<endOfText>
<bot>It depends on what they are  organise the things they need.<endOfText>
<human>There hasn't been any attempt about savings, or reduced commitments or any, or everything is here, and if it hasn't been attempts, perhaps we could have a list of what's actually been removed.<endOfText>
<bot>Did you wish to?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, erm, thank you Chair.<endOfText>
<bot>The process that was followed in preparing the , which was exactly the same process as being followed in previous years.<endOfText>
<human>It started with these  exercise in July and August, which sought to identify erm, commitments required to maintain existing services.<endOfText>
<bot>It also sought to i identify opportunity to efficiency and effectiveness savings.<endOfText>
<human>So exactly the same process was followed.<endOfText>
<bot>At a subse subsequent st stage again, as has happened in the in the past, inflation was added, and that was fully to reprice from November ninety-two to November ninety-three prices.<endOfText>
<human>So yet again, the budget was reflecting the amount of money necessary to maintain existing services.<endOfText>
<bot>Now th the the the way in which the budget has been prepared in previous years, has been  maintain existing services.<endOfText>
<human>So, in that respect, there is no difference in the preparation of this budget, er in comparison with the previous years.<endOfText>
<bot>The result of all the calculations including er commitments, er necessary, for example for additional pupils, erm, lead to an overall budget requirement of three hundred and eighty-one point four million pounds.<endOfText>
<human>To maintain existing levels of service, and that was the the budget that was approved by the Policy Committee in November, but, with the rider that the erm, the the overall budget would be review reviewed in January in the light of the Revenue Support Grant Settlement, and that still is the position.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you.<endOfText>
<human>The the statement that all commitments has been allowed, isn't <endOfText>
<bot>Commitments <endOfText>
<human>written, you say, all commitments have been ensured.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Commitments necessary for the maintenance of existing levels of service <endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Well that  necessary, at least ways to augment this.<endOfText>
<bot>No, they were saying totally different.<endOfText>
<human>I think you've question that far enough.<endOfText>
<bot>You've had your answer.<endOfText>
<human>You asked, how would it be prepared?<endOfText>
<bot>It, you've, it was be prepared on the same basis as last year, in fact, the other <endOfText>
<human>We went through it with a fine tooth comb.<endOfText>
<bot>We found all the little bits and pieces, the er, er, idiosyncrasies of how it had been prepared previously by yourself,<endOfText>
<human>And er, we're quite satisfied with the process that has taken place.<endOfText>
<bot>Probably more thorough and more searching than ever.<endOfText>
<human>I don't particularly want to go <endOfText>
<bot>Exactly.<endOfText>
<human>All I'm trying to say  <endOfText>
<bot>Sorry, that was, I'm sorry, you've spo I'm sorry you've spoken, I'm just commenting  will you be quiet please, I'm taking next speaker.<endOfText>
<human>Well,<endOfText>
<bot>Will you be quiet.<endOfText>
<human>You can ya, you can come in here later.<endOfText>
<bot>Did you wish to?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I just referred Councillor Wild to paragraph eleven on page A three, because, it it does say reasonably clearly, I think, that the Policy Committee resolved to review the overall level of spending in January nineteen ninety-four in the light of the Revenue Support Grant Settlement.<endOfText>
<bot>We had, we had to conservative speakers so far, erm, and Councillor Brock seem to me, in a sense to be summing up that phrase about knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing, because there was the the the es essential arithmetical calculation about percentages, and savings.<endOfText>
<human>No mention about the difficult task that the County Council's got in living within a budget, a capping level of three hundred and seventy million, and it would be reasonable, in in a, in a, in a sense that when somebody's proposing opposition to a budget, it gives some indication as to what within the budget, would have to be cut.<endOfText>
<bot>It's not really helpful to be able to say, that the amount of money is too great, to refer to percentage increases which are higher than the figure that would have been included by erm erm an opposition group.<endOfText>
<human>But not actually to say, what what what would be the outcome of the percentage cuts.<endOfText>
<bot>Of course, it's quite right, and it's it's in a sense maybe reasonable to oppose a budget, but in the past, I think it's been erm, one of the strengths of the labour group, when in opposition to put alternative budgets in for say, yes, we take a view that's different to the budget that's before us, but so far with two conservative speakers, we've not had the benefit of knowing which items, which levels of of spending within this policy committee, be it the Chief Exec.<endOfText>
<human>Department or the County Treasurer's Department is not considered to be relevant to the needs of erm, the County Council, the people of Lincolnshire, and I think it's reasonable to ask that question, and to hope that erm future conservatives speakers in this meeting, on this paper will give a clear indication as to what will be the effects of a budget reduction.<endOfText>
<bot>Chairman, er, can I very briefly reply to what Councillor Parker has said, and then come on to my erm, uncontroversial question about our  Erm, I think now is not the time to give a detailed reply to this.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>conservative administration will change the budget, obviously, you have highlighted in what you have said before, that the main crunch will come at the next Policy Committee.<endOfText>
<human>I think that is the time that we would er, wish to put forward er a detailed alternative, or seek alternatives.<endOfText>
<bot>So far as to my specific erm, question is on B one, on the white paper,or other target, the public question, thirteen thousand, five hundred pounds of  money you do say in the subsequent paragraph, this is to provide public question time at Council meetings.<endOfText>
<human>Is that all that that thirteen thousand five hundred is targeted for, and that is for the four meetings of the County Council each year, when there will be a public er question time.<endOfText>
<bot>Could I, I I I will answer that.<endOfText>
<human>If you read further on, it does say, Committee and sub-Committees, to encourage involvement.<endOfText>
<bot>In that paragraph.<endOfText>
<human>Have you answered that question.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, what Councillor Newton's just said, I would just like to ask for a clarification there, if I may.<endOfText>
<human>Is he guaranteeing to tell us where everyone of the cooks is going to come at the next Policy Meeting.<endOfText>
<bot>Is it being proposed?<endOfText>
<human>Well.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>That was easy.<endOfText>
<bot>Mr Chairman, rapidly respond to Councillor Parker, you are the administration, this is your budget,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>This is your budget.<endOfText>
<human>Had it been in administration, we would have put forward to our budget.<endOfText>
<bot>But I mean, you are being totally unrealistic in putting a budget forward, of three hundred and eighty one million er, for the County Council.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, that is not at all relevant to the policies of the previous authority.<endOfText>
<bot>These are your policies, they're not our policies.<endOfText>
<human>And er, you know, you've got yourself in this mess, get yourself out of it.<endOfText>
<bot>Education  <endOfText>
<human>Yes, right.<endOfText>
<bot>We don't consider we're in a mess.<endOfText>
<human>I would remind you that this is the budget for the policy.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, true.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, when we was in opposition, if er, if we had a Westminster crisis in Lincolnshire and it suddenly kicked all the conservatives off, we would have been able to come up with an alternative budget to manage this county.<endOfText>
<bot>Now I think it's only fair and right that the conservatives are doing as er, should be doing the same.<endOfText>
<human>But they are<endOfText>
<bot>Will you be quiet, please, sir.<endOfText>
<human>All they are proposing  is, we're, well, all they're doing is opposing, we oppose this, we oppose this, we oppose this, they're coming up with no information, that the people of Lincolnshire can judge them on.<endOfText>
<bot>And I think it's unfair of them, I think it's irresponsible of them to just criticise detailed budgets that are well thought out like ours, like ours always were<endOfText>
<human>I have nothing, and to have nothing to offer the people of Lincolnshire as an alternative.<endOfText>
<bot>It's just rhetoric, in a way,<endOfText>
<human>irresponsible rhetoric.<endOfText>
<bot>Perhaps they don't know what to do.<endOfText>
<human>Councillor <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I think, I I sympathise on what the er, new opposition, because I think, it does take some time to  particularly after you've<endOfText>
<human>been in opposition for the last, well, for the for the for the rememberable future,<endOfText>
<bot>You should  <endOfText>
<human>and er, I think that er, er I I I'm quite interested an and really quite amused, if I once gone on proceedings of this council, because every time a a new initiative has been proposed, you have said, oh yes, we were going to do that.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes .<endOfText>
<human>In any case, we er and we want er no opposition to it, and in fact I I was surprised we owned a pack a pack of goodies<endOfText>
<bot>in the transportation planning committee yesterday, and the, one of the question of opposing them, it was what was going to block, that they,wh wha were they members, gonna get for their pockets and their own patches, and er, I I think, so I mean, I asked a a a councillor, well I asked a question on five per cent for me yesterday, and my response was, yes, precisely.<endOfText>
<human>Now, if you're going to er er er er want everything and then at the same time, want to reduce the budget, then I think you're like the man who wanted a cake an and you'll find that he wanted to eat it, so I think you've got to come to terms and be realistic.<endOfText>
<bot>And so it would be most interesting to see what sort of patent you can come up with for policy, and and and and and and we'll see just just how you'll meet that.<endOfText>
<human>I shall have other things to see, later on, Chair.<endOfText>
<bot>What other information, Mr Chairman, he didn't say that at all yesterday.<endOfText>
<human>What he said was he was waiting for the government for better <endOfText>
<bot>Ca ca ca can I say.<endOfText>
<human>Councillor councillor  it is not a final information<endOfText>
<bot>he's telling lies <endOfText>
<human>I'm I'm sorry, and I'd rather we didn't use that sort of language, 'cos you remember you are being recorded.<endOfText>
<bot>He was referring to something that happened yesterday, and we're here,<endOfText>
<human>We're here today, discussing the policy and we'd like to stay with that.<endOfText>
<bot>That's right,an answer the question.<endOfText>
<human>Very good.<endOfText>
<bot>He's a <endOfText>
<human>Okay, you've answered it now.<endOfText>
<bot>Any other questions or comments?<endOfText>
<human>Councillor <endOfText>
<bot>Well, Mr Chairman, I think er, you know, it's all right putting forward a budget like this, but there's only one person who got paid for it, and that's the general public.<endOfText>
<human>And er, I think that there are people who are a little wet behind the ears if they think that the general public are going to accept the costs of a budget that's coming forward on a long these lines.<endOfText>
<bot>And er, you know, I know we're looking at one particular committee.<endOfText>
<human>And I would ask you to direct your questions to that, because there's an another time and another place when you can talk and er discuss, and put forward proposals regarding the councils overall budgets, so I would ask you to concentrate on this, but.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, well, right.<endOfText>
<human>There are, there are starting points which we, the opposition party would have started from, and it is not from er, er the the same er, erm,<endOfText>
<bot>that you have arrived at, that we would have arrived at.<endOfText>
<human>There are differences within .<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, you know, for for instance, as Councillor speak Newton has just said, that there's<endOfText>
<human>thirteen thousand five hundred.<endOfText>
<bot>The there are other things, which er we<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>would have presented a very good budget for <endOfText>
<human>and a lot of other commitments.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you opposing the thirteen thousand?<endOfText>
<human>I I don't mind, but I'm opposing, as like the rest of us the budget in <endOfText>
<bot>I think you, Mr Chairman, it would be totally improper if we did not raise the issue within the within the budget if we did not raise the issue of election members and the expenses of election members.<endOfText>
<human>We did, at the time, when the expenses were incurred, we gave it, that we were opposed to all the increases that were being made, we still maintain that policy, and I believe that there is a time when we should be be in approval, that we in fact, expending money on new active members is wrong, when in fact, have the cut backs, because at the end of the day, people of Lincolnshire have to pay for these additional expenses incurred to elected members.<endOfText>
<bot>You've heard <endOfText>
<human>to inform members generally of the level of settlement in the County Councillors  under the transport, E F P grants arranged.<endOfText>
<bot>Overall the level of settlement was disappointing as the summary on the paper recalls.<endOfText>
<human>Sample.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, grant comes at a rate of fifty per cent that have accepted it as expenditure.<endOfText>
<human>It may be in in one or two forms, erm, cash, or expected expenditure.<endOfText>
<bot>erm, by the grants of credit approvals, either basic or supplementary, which is A that facilitating a council spending money on the programmes which the D T P have accepted.<endOfText>
<human>Overall, if one aggregates those three things, the level of settlement for the county was down thirty- one per cent on the year, compared with a national total, which was also in distress of fourteen and a half per cent down.<endOfText>
<bot>The settlement does reflect some change in government policy and the areas of expenditure, which have previously attracted direct grant, are now being met through the grant accredits approvals, which do ultimately bring cash to the council, erm, because they keyed into assets aims, and the revenues court-room mechanism.<endOfText>
<human>But over a period of time, erm, they are not directly equivalent, but very nearly so.<endOfText>
<bot>It is just information, Chairman, that the amounts in the various categories that are recorded within the paper and I think probably <endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>I realise this information, it's very depressing information.<endOfText>
<human>I think it it was a it it was a very bad er announcement for Lincolnshire, and er, on the strength of that, er, for the benefit of all of us in the county, I just like to lobe a few, as a minister for roads and traffic, er expressing our bitter disappointment really, 'cos it's er, particularly on the T S G, it's a, it's a cut of of er, of forty five per cent against the er er er national cut of of of of of of about half of that.<endOfText>
<bot>And and and and across the board there has been a cut of er, er of of of just below fifteen per cent, that that the that er er, our cut is forty five per cent , and and I mean, it er, it it it does er er create problems, there's no doubt about it, and that I I got the letter from er which er, Rod  instructed to come along to the department to me yesterday, in fact, I did refer very briefly to it, 'cos I'm gonna  just before the meeting that er er it it sets out saying that it was a very generous set settlement for ninety-three, ninety-four.<endOfText>
<human>Now, of course, we we know that that you know, that that that that er, that even then, part of that settlement has has gone because they've cut off on the  of the Western by-pass, I mean, you've still got er, er<endOfText>
<bot>quite a substantial, er amount of money which has got to be financed from my own funds on that.<endOfText>
<human>And er, I did er, er invite members, all members yesterday, and I do have a feed-back here, again, that they do write to lobby on behalf of us, because I, if this is going to be the patent for the future, it's gonna have very serious implications as to what we do in terms of improving the highway infrastructure at Lincolnshire.<endOfText>
<bot>And this is at a time, of course, when we have other doors opening to us, which we shall need match funding, objective  rural Dent, and er, er for the for the for the budget to be, it to have been cut in this way, is is is is very serious.<endOfText>
<human>The problem is that the, the present er er er er formula for road pricing, cobra, cobra as it is called.<endOfText>
<bot>I think sometimes it would be better to call it cobra because it does seem to have a very er er deadly sting as far as Lincolnshire's concerned at the moment.<endOfText>
<human>Er, doesn't er er, is based on congestion, and and and and other factors, and it doesn't address the er, the the needs we have er in developing this county, and and to achieve it's er it's potential.<endOfText>
<bot>I think there is.<endOfText>
<human>We are at<endOfText>
<bot>a point at the moment, with the life of the county, I think that we should great potential and great opportunity available to us, and I do hope that all members will er, and I've written to all our members of parliament with a copy of my letter, er, I had I've had er, I know it's been the Christmas period, and that they're only just getting back into things, and there's been a lot of diversions at length, and I do have a letter from, er I heard from er, Edward, er, Mr Edward Lee, and and, I still have to hear it from er, the rest of them.<endOfText>
<human>I have had a message from the Stan Standard Mercury, from  Davis, that my  a county has been hysterical, we've talked about being paranoid one time this morning.<endOfText>
<bot>But he<endOfText>
<human>he says we're hysterical.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, if he lived in the north- east, er part of this county, that great ar area where there is very little in terms of infrastructure perhaps er er it's a pity we can't have a few more hysterics and we would perhaps get further down the road.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you, Chairman<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you, Mr Chairman, erm, I'm here to say, it's quite true to say that it does vary from year to year, on er, what our programme is, but er, we we also have to face it, that er,com compared with some other areas, both east midlands and nationally, we do not have the traffic, and this does go against our for T A. Er, the the traffic on our roads<endOfText>
<human>Although it's very dense, does not compared with the likes of Kent and the south.<endOfText>
<bot>But er, yes er, I would have been er, I think if I'd still been in Jim's place, er quite rightly so, getting all that we can for the town.<endOfText>
<human>But it does vary from year to year.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you, Mr Chairman, erm, I find this absolutely staggering, this settlement.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, over the last few months, we've been over our administration, attacked, saying that we don't care about the rural communities, only the conservative party care about the rural communities, that's what we've been told.<endOfText>
<bot>And then we get a conservative central government, er, cutting the er, funding for the most sparsely pos populated county in the country, not by the same as the rest of the country, but by thirty-one per cent.<endOfText>
<human>Over double.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, something's slightly wrong there, erm, it shows that there is a lot of hypocrisy within the conservative party, er, double standards right the way across the board.<endOfText>
<human>Secondly, erm, I'd like to ask o ask the question as well, erm, regarding the transfer from central government grants to S C A's.<endOfText>
<bot>Could it, could people please stop conferring a minute, er, that is actually the government, saying that they no longer gonna give grants, their going to give us the right to borrow, and are actually encouraging us to do it.<endOfText>
<human>that is the effects, I mean they will still give grant, but indirectly through the revenues for  and it will be spared but, for a  number of years, you can't be absolutely precise about how long.<endOfText>
<bot>we note a what, a hundred and thirty million pounds worth of road planned for this county.<endOfText>
<human>Every one of them that they were gonna do next year.<endOfText>
<bot>Every time<endOfText>
<human>No, no, no.<endOfText>
<bot>No, no, no.<endOfText>
<human>We've had<endOfText>
<bot>we get a savage thirty-one ke cent, thirty-one per cent reduction, and what do we get, a tiniest whimper from the previous chairman of the committee.<endOfText>
<human>Oh well, there's reasons for it.<endOfText>
<bot>And yet, I can bet that every time, Jim has his committee meeting, they're gonna be hammering on the door, for some by- pass, or some road scheme that they would have done.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, that's right, that's right.<endOfText>
<bot>Absolutely every one they would have done.<endOfText>
<human>That's right.<endOfText>
<bot>Give him the floor.<endOfText>
<human>And what are they doing about it.<endOfText>
<bot>What they doing for the people of Lincolnshire.<endOfText>
<human>Are they gonna go down to see their friends, at Central Government, and say, come on, this thirty-one per cent is totally unacceptable.<endOfText>
<bot>What they gonna do about it?<endOfText>
<human>They took u is that it.<endOfText>
<bot>Is that the soul er contribution we're gonna get from this conservative group.<endOfText>
<human>Well, you know, we have got, haven't got quite the traffic that other places have got.<endOfText>
<bot>And they're just gonna leave us to deal with it.<endOfText>
<human>They're letting the people of Lincolnshire down.<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>Well, when did we ever ask you, the labour and liberal vice, to come down to Westminster with us, Mr Chairman.<endOfText>
<bot>That's one of  but we but we never did, we all went down,and sometimes we did and sometimes we didn't  Part of er,was on about, is that in ninety-five, ninety-six  highways by four million quid.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, and it was  so, it's obviously as good as it was, you know, I think you could resign as chairman, if  actually  at all, so.<endOfText>
<bot>a burden of a hundred and thirty million pounds.<endOfText>
<human>We would have funded that over ten years.<endOfText>
<bot>funded.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I heard you, yes, I heard you say the other day, and also did read in the press, where you've been quoted, Councillor Warby, that you would build various by-passes and no doubt you will be putting, I haven't yet heard any amendments to the capital goal.<endOfText>
<bot>I did sit in yesterday at Transport Exec and Planning, but no doubt they will be forthcoming <endOfText>
<human>Mr. Chairman, did I hear correctly that, that the hundred and thirty million would have been funded over ten years.<endOfText>
<bot>Ridiculous <endOfText>
<human>So can you tell us, please, where the additional ten million  <endOfText>
<bot>We only went through  <endOfText>
<human>Sorry, Mr Chairman, where the additional ten million cuts would have been made to fund that.<endOfText>
<bot>Well cuts  <endOfText>
<human>need it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I'm pleased that this erm, statement, I think it was in capital monitoring a few weeks ago by Councillor Wyle, is now out into the public domain,<endOfText>
<human>because capital monitoring was a a a closed committee.<endOfText>
<bot>The hundred and thirty pounds that Councillor  referred to, is the, are the schemes in totality.<endOfText>
<human>A hundred and thirty million.<endOfText>
<bot>A hundred and thirty  million  around the county, you know the Lincoln relief road, the eastern relief road, stage one, twenty-five million, the stage two another eight million.<endOfText>
<human>Boston  The list goes on until we get to a total of a hundred and thirty million.<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor  said that that that that hundred and thirty million could be funded over a period of ten years, at thirteen million pound a year.<endOfText>
<human>Now, that is something, that one would find difficult to accept normally, erm, but seeing as our Councillor  has been chair of transportation, I believe in the past and also leader of the County Council, that then it it does make one wonder about erm,bud bud budgeting and raising expectations of people around the county unnecessarily.<endOfText>
<bot>We we've noted the way that every time there is a local issue about a particular road scheme, that the conservatives immediately say, we would have done that next year.<endOfText>
<human>Th the will be other new schemes that were, not yet come forward, because the local media have not, erm, addressed a particular area, but as soon as it does in March or April, then the town conservatives would have done that next year.<endOfText>
<bot>And the, and the list goes on.<endOfText>
<human>I think that the point, has to be made that when we've had a transport supplementary grant decision and settlement as poor as this one, then it really is about trying to protect and enhance the people of Lincolnshire and the road network, rather than just for once, party politics, because I can't honestly believe that the conservatives would actually, feel that this is a fair, reasonable settlement.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, to be quite honest about it, it's a, it's an unsatisfactory settlement, from whichever political party that you come from, and it's about time, perhaps, the conservatives recognised that you can't support a national government policy that does as much damage to the people of LIncolnshire as this transport supplementary grant settlement has done.<endOfText>
<human>Could I just correct you on that, I think it was acknowledged by this vote, er for transport  plan settlement.<endOfText>
<bot>I  yes.<endOfText>
<human>I <endOfText>
<bot>You know.<endOfText>
<human>I  I would have made an oasis, and I would have er tried to achieve a better settlement<endOfText>
<bot>That is accepted, and in fact we <endOfText>
<human>No  I'm sorry, no.<endOfText>
<bot>Information <endOfText>
<human>Councillor  <endOfText>
<bot>Well, Councillor very briefly, in response to Councillor  referred the same sort of thing from yourself er, chairman, on on numerous occasions.<endOfText>
<human>I think it's about time that you stopped bleating.<endOfText>
<bot>I think it's about time that you stopped blaming, and I think it's about time that you started accepting re le responsibility that you are in it and getting on and making this council.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>We shall accept full responsibility for everything we do.<endOfText>
<human>It it does concern me, Chairman, David, Councillor Morbey has just said, I would have made noises, and I would have attempted to get a better settlement.<endOfText>
<bot>Why won't he do that for the people of Lincolnshire now.<endOfText>
<human>I'm not changing my tune, Councillor Wyle knows that in the past I have actually offered to go with them when they've made erm, visits to the minister, and when he said, we we we tried, but we never got anywhere, and on various issues I've said, well perhaps if we got us an all party delegation, at least we could have done no worse.<endOfText>
<bot>Now why, now is Councillor Warby now saying I would have done it, not I will do it.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, just a point of information, I think er on the hundred and thirty-one million, including the Lincoln, and I think er they would have been you would have been under serious er distress on that, because the information I have had from the Department of Transport, is that if the Lincoln scheme had gone ahead, it would have effectively blocked everything else for the next five years, and that wouldn't have done you any good, from where you're elected, either.<endOfText>
<human>So we're looking at it first, I I think in the end, there are schemes that we've got to put on to the back burner, or the, until such times Lincoln develops further, and there is further development.<endOfText>
<bot>It needs another twenty thousand people, I think,if that's going to go ahead.<endOfText>
<human>But the, the fact is, that what I, my plea to you today, and and my plea to the committee yesterday is, that I don't want this to be in the political arena, it is in the political arena, but I think we do need to to er er er take it out of the political arena, for the benefit of of all the people that that put us here.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>In this county.<endOfText>
<bot>Not for the conservative party or the liberal party or the labour party.<endOfText>
<human>It is called benefit and and the well being of those kids about there, that we're educating them at our own school, that they can have jobs and work, and if this is going, my fear is, okay we can live within this,s as you say, it may that it's just bad settlement for one year.<endOfText>
<bot>We shall have to live with it, because er I I don't think that any hope of any redress next year, but the  got to be established of a different system, of me a different methodology for the foreseeable years, if we're going to get those schemes through that you supported wholeheartedly and congratulated us and  for bringing forward the new road schemes for er the that that that that you so approved so warmly yesterday.<endOfText>
<human>Well you, we we can't do those, unless we get er, more cooperation from central government.<endOfText>
<bot>I I got,we we've established a  and I'm delighted that the minister is part of that, because he controls the purse, and the purse strings.<endOfText>
<human>Otherwise the forum is just a talking shop.<endOfText>
<bot>So it is essential that those people that<endOfText>
<human>that that control the purse are part of the dialogue, and I I hope David that you will continue to make your submissions, in opposition as I did.<endOfText>
<bot>the Chair,Chair.<endOfText>
<human>Can I come back  <endOfText>
<bot>Er, Mrs Pinchbetter said.<endOfText>
<human>She must realise that the conservatives are in opposition.<endOfText>
<bot>I am not a Chairman, Jill is, Jill Dobsworth is, and the other fact.<endOfText>
<human>Yesterday, it was proposed that a committee be formed to look into speed limits.<endOfText>
<bot>The conservatives asked to be represented on that committee and they were refused by the ruling groups.<endOfText>
<human>We were told that you might have as much effect on that as you're having with central government.<endOfText>
<bot>What is it, you're our Chairman, Mr Chairman, but I am a little concerned, there seems to be two stands this morning.<endOfText>
<human>You've already curtailed  when, you said you've already spoken, you cannot again.<endOfText>
<bot>Wh wha what what comment have you got.<endOfText>
<human>I'm I'm saying, I'm in the Chair.<endOfText>
<bot>is, if you are Chairman, be consistent<endOfText>
<human>I am consistent.<endOfText>
<bot>If there's one person speaking  <endOfText>
<human>Is it, do you wish to comment on this paper?<endOfText>
<bot>I want to s s comment on  on this meeting.<endOfText>
<human>Well, come on then.<endOfText>
<bot>No, no, no, well, that that's within my purview, and the purview of the committee who elected me.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>If you wish to comment on the paper, I give everyone the opportunity, and believe you me, I'm being as very, as fair as I can.<endOfText>
<human>But we can only, we can talk as many times as we like, then, Mr Chairman.<endOfText>
<bot>If I allow you to, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>I think we've had a fair er debate on that.<endOfText>
<human>We have the report and it is for noting.<endOfText>
<bot>Unless anybody has any er, other amendments to put forward.<endOfText>
<human>Do you agree with these recommendations?<endOfText>
<bot>Agreed.<endOfText>
<human>Agreed.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you.<endOfText>
<human>Er, the next paper is er, the external auditors management letter, and we have with us today, Coopers and Liebrand representatives and I understand Max  who, you're going to er, speak to us about <endOfText>
<bot>Thank you.<endOfText>
<human>just remind members by er, way of introduction that this is the the first occasion when the external auditor has been er invited to answer questions and make points on the management er er, letter to the full committee.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, that's all all I want to say, and I think er Max here, has got erm, something by way of introduction, and then there will be an opportunity to question us.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, not not a form of opening government.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you want to  erm,well I've come today as the partner responsible for recruiting my men for the audit of the County Council, together with my colleague Stephen Critchley, who is the partner responsible for the regularity audit, the main accounts of the  County Council accounts.<endOfText>
<human>And another senior colleague Steve Mcleod on my right, whose primary responsibility is with the value for money work that we undertake on your behalf.<endOfText>
<bot>And as we set out in the management letter, it's a requirement of the audit commissioners code of practice, as we do report to areas of all the authorities that we deal with on an annual basis.<endOfText>
<human>And indeed,erm, in the papers, summarise, really summarises  the work that you undertake and including December ninety-two, to December ninety-three.<endOfText>
<bot>There's the work that we do erm, most of the  that we undertake, actually are erm, engaged in providing an opinion on the accounts of the  County Council.<endOfText>
<human>But we do have a responsibility for value for money, and legality issues as well, and appendix eight of our paper actually summarises in brief form the work that we've undertaken on your behalf this year.<endOfText>
<bot>The audit, er, the the accounts  your your offices will be assigned er, as of the twenty-third of December, of ninety-three, and, but we're not able yet to conclude the audit as I'm considering an objection which has been received from a member, on the matter of publicity.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, the local government act nineteen ninety-two permits the auditor to actually advise the council to er matters which we believe that you should consider in full, er er, County erm, Council meeting, and I'm pleased to confirm that for this year there is nothing of that nature, that er, we would put to you, to refer to.<endOfText>
<bot>Lincolnshire has a lot of history of being a well managed authority, a proved  exercising sound controls on its financial and management affairs, and I'm pleased to say that I'm again in a position to confirm that that is our view, for the conduct of the Council's business in the period on which we are reporting.<endOfText>
<human>In Paragraph one oh nine, and one ten,th , I do actually draw your attention to two areas, though I think that members amongst all the  issues that we have to deal with erm, to bear in mind in particular, and indeed the first one, probably the most important, in the sense of the longer term financial indications to reduce the extension of it is, limits that are being imposed upon local government generally, and of course here in Lincolnshire in particularly, in particular .<endOfText>
<bot>And indeed, I think that it is quite clearly the theme, there's been money through the meeting this morning.<endOfText>
<human>Er, it is a very difficult climate, it's becoming increasingly difficult, and indeed, it's affecting the work that we do, in the sense that, the more government<endOfText>
<bot>awards monies for specific purposes,your offices for specific and confirm the expense of those purposes, annual auditors to actually confirm that it has been so spent.<endOfText>
<human>And it's increasing the burden of work upon your offices and upon the auditors as well.<endOfText>
<bot>It is a difficult climate, and the announcement before Christmas that erm, no government expenditure would increase by some two point three per cent, generally across England and Wales, is clearly not erm, worked so well for Lincolnshire with a capping limit increasing only by one point seven per cent , and the S S A, is increasing by one point two per cent .<endOfText>
<human>And quite clearly managing your affairs as you have done in the past within this context, becomes more difficult.<endOfText>
<bot>But I think we see that with the capital programme, that quite clearly you're erm, having to take into account the fact that capital spend erm, cannot be er maintained at the level it has in the past, and indeed I believe you are talking about this matter, er, later on this morning.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, but that's an indication of what's happening in that area, and indeed, the members erm, I am pleased to say, have taken the right attitude to that, recognised that that's the case and er addressing that, together with the revenue spend, erm, in a manner which I find is erm, of responsible and approved.<endOfText>
<human>In spite of this, there has been serious developments and in this year, and they'll be fully in place next year.<endOfText>
<bot>And the process under which that was taking place, er reminds you all that you are unhappy with as well.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, the monetary outlook is not going to be easy.<endOfText>
<bot>The erm, any other areas that I've drew particular attention as a, as a, key issue is on the matter of er legality and doing work for other bodies, which has been an issue here which er, as you may recall we mentioned that in the last two or three years.<endOfText>
<human>We have done some work with your offices on that, and whilst on most of your activities aren't happy with er the scale of such that it does cause me a problem, there is one particular area that we are in discussion with the Chief Executive, and your offices relating to doing work for other bodies to  and the contract vehicle hire service, and er, that's something which we will  and no doubt will be brought  us in the very near future.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm,the only other thing I think it remains for me to say is that erm, the work will be undertaken on a value for money nature.<endOfText>
<human>Most of that is presently with your offices and draw up a reports in a moment, it was on special education needs, and so on.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, we have a programme developing for next year, which we will discuss with your offices, to ensure that we use the time that we validated to your audit er, in an effective, efficient and economic manner.<endOfText>
<human>And the regularity work, which is what we call the work on the accounts, the opinion on the accounts, the work seems very well, and the timetable that was agreed with er, the County Treasurer offices.<endOfText>
<bot>and er, which we finished, and I would really just like to say that erm, thanks very much for the cooperation that we received from the offices generally across the authority.<endOfText>
<human>I think it's fair to say, that we do not  all matters, and I hope that nobody's here that would appreciate that the audit role is an independent role.<endOfText>
<bot>We have considerable rights, of inspection, search, discussion, and the right to documents.<endOfText>
<human>Er, your officers have always, extremely cooperative in that way, and that they're a particular group of officers, they don't like to agree with everything that we say, and we have to go with robust discussions.<endOfText>
<bot>Ultimately, I believe that er, the best interest is leave it to ourselves by that particular process, and with that Chairman, I wish to conclude.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you very much.<endOfText>
<bot>Anyone wish to  Councillor <endOfText>
<human>No, it's just a general enquiry, really, I I guess erm, erm, you you've, through you Chairman, I I've I've heard about the involvement of officers, but I wonder what extent there is involvement of of of members in the the the process of preparing those reports and presentations of the report, is is there any  member comment on that.<endOfText>
<bot>Would you like to,<endOfText>
<human>Certainly, erm, it has changed this year, erm, but the arrangements now are, that we produce our report across the year, with i , and as you can appreciate the report summarises various, of one thing we done during the  with officers around the county round the  Erm, at the, at the end of November, we commit to writing this report in summary version, which we then discuss with the Chief Executive and the County Treasurer in particular, they take whatever soundings they wish with other offices and then we agree that letter.<endOfText>
<bot>At that point, once the letter is finalised, we then did have a meeting with two members, the Chairman of this Committee that'll be Councillor Park, to just go through it, and that happened on Monday morning of this week.<endOfText>
<human>Great long speech.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you.<endOfText>
<human>So our involvement was for it to be presented to us before it came to this meeting.<endOfText>
<bot>Any other queries on this?<endOfText>
<human>One question, Mr Chairman, er er er information really er on this section one one oh.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm,does specific questions relating to er, matters that the auditor has brought to you, you've mentioned the Chief Executive, but a general opinion, really.<endOfText>
<human>Is he saying, I understand sir, that you, you approve of cross border tampering from other local authorities or not?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, may I take the opportunity to say that cross border  is a bit of a misnomer, erm, it's, the correct term is really doing work for other bodies.<endOfText>
<human>It's absolutely clear that the public body should be doing work for private sector organisations, and er, to my knowledge, Lincolnshire County Council have not been  to that particular erm, definition, although other authorities do and I have had to stop other authorities undertaking contracts where they are er private sector organisations.<endOfText>
<bot>So far as doing work with public sector bodies erm, the business services act of nineteen seventy-six came into stand, this creates a lot of er,which work had been done.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, the main requirement is, that where you have resources or applied property to discharge your own functions, people come under the  then you are at liberty to use those resources where it doesn't increase the capacity to do work for other public bodies, but you should neither increase your own capacity to do work with other bodies<endOfText>
<bot>nor should you seek to do derive a profit from the services that you provide to, I don't know, public bodies.<endOfText>
<human>Does that answer your question.<endOfText>
<bot>That answers my question, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Councillor Weller?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I'll ask er, oh they're not here.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, thank you, first of all for this statement.<endOfText>
<bot>I think it's the longest we've approved and <endOfText>
<human>Long may it's costing you.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, but the question that I'd like to a a ask is, erm,reducing, er it's about capital, because er, where the capital is being in use, and and like yesterday  reducing capital is always an easy option.<endOfText>
<human>Requesting when there was fifty million programmes, and that  it's it's it's an option that governments always take.<endOfText>
<bot>I must admit,weak option, but its an easy option.<endOfText>
<human>Lincolnshire's capital, lively financed from revenue, of course grants, and property sales etc. are sold, that money can be transferred into services, and money can be borrowed.<endOfText>
<bot>So it is easy option to borrow and spend that money on services.<endOfText>
<human>are rather different, if the builder wants us to borrow on their behalf, that's one thing, whether we should borrow on our behalf, is a question that one has to.<endOfText>
<bot>So would he have any comments to make, say next year at this time.<endOfText>
<human>Or is there an area which you would get into on the question of whether how hard we should struggle before we er, do that sort of thing, or whether it's purely a matter for for the County Council  <endOfText>
<bot>Could I be before you answer that question, you did ask, didn't you, ask him to be hypothetical and say what would he say in a year's time, and I think what <endOfText>
<human>Well, I meant, I I I  I mean, it is his job talking to  comment on  <endOfText>
<bot>Well, I'll ask him.<endOfText>
<human>is it, is it he can answer that question, is it he's job to look in what er, happened in a year's time.<endOfText>
<bot>It is not my job to comment on the policy of the County Council.<endOfText>
<human>Expect only in that, it was a danger that you were going to incur expenditure, which is of an unlawful n nature, pending on the clearly wish to comment.<endOfText>
<bot>Or indeed, if the consequences of that particular policy decision is such that the erm, the revenue considerations were serious and improvable and in which case, you would not be deriving value for money, and I most certainly would have a comment to make.<endOfText>
<human>Johnny , Johnny  would ask you if you did the auditing for Westminster, but, er that's a bit wrong at this stage.<endOfText>
<bot>I do not wish to discuss  <endOfText>
<human>Well, I, seriously, Mr Chairman, conservative group for the County Council of Westminster is a lot better than it is.<endOfText>
<bot>You'll have to write to Lady  Anyone else wish to comment on<endOfText>
<human>If not.<endOfText>
<bot>Could I, thank you very much, sir, and you're, thank you for coming in, and the way you presented the report, it's a difficult report, and we hope that er, we're in a similar situation  Thank you.<endOfText>
<human>Right, erm, I'm not too sure  Paper ten, Treasury Management, and I believe this is going to be taken by Noel Harrison.<endOfText>
<bot>Chair.<endOfText>
<human>It's er almost two years ago now that erm, and it, I'd like you to wait, but not entirely as a consequence of B C C I's er, demise, that Citra published a code of practice to Treasury Management and a guide to the Chief Officers who were members of that Institution.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, in terms of Treasury Management.<endOfText>
<human>One of the requirements of that particular council guides to the Chief Officers was that, they should bring before the councils a statement that Treasury Management policy and arrangements and that, in fact, was done in the autumn of ninety-two, and the council adopted a particular statement which reflected its circumstances at the time, erm, and the then policy.<endOfText>
<bot>By and large that particular go erm, statement, which is actually embodied in financial regulations also, envisage erm, a a situation where there would be no long term borrowing.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, since that particular time, the financial climate has significantly changed, and the government policy in relation to certain areas of expenditure which I comment , which I commented on earlier, erm, has also changed, in that  instead of paying direct grant, they are now issuing credit approvals, which permits borrowing to agreed levels within the constraints of the capital control mechanisms, that the government have in place, the controlling overall levels of indebtedness of councils.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, whilst those credit approvals do bring reimbursement to the council over time, the equivalent amount to grant in broad terms.<endOfText>
<human>What they, you do is, in fact shift the incidence on cash flow.<endOfText>
<bot>Given that change in circumstances, we, it was felt that it would be prudent to propose to members a change to the actual statement which was  in place, so that it would permit consideration of longer term borrowing, in particular circumstances and where it's in the interest of the authority, and have the flexibility to do so, in relating to the prudent managements of its affairs, Chairman.<endOfText>
<human>I think all those who the statement, I don't propose to go through it in detail.<endOfText>
<bot>I think I could probably stop there.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>Papers headed erm, Treasury Management, but essentially it's about<endOfText>
<human>taking out loans and borrowing and I don't think that this County Council ought to be defensive in the slightest about having a tool such as borrowing available to us  in terms of financial management.<endOfText>
<bot>I think I want to start by reminding everybody that borrowing to finance capital spending is the norm, for almost all local authorities in this country.<endOfText>
<human>I want then, to go on to say that if we take a view, about fairness, and I think that that's an important word that we, certainly from our side, want to use regularly and practice.<endOfText>
<bot>If we take a view about fairness, then the funding of capital schemes is fairer if the charge and the cost of the those schemes is spread over the life of the the asset.<endOfText>
<human>Because then all the people that use that asset, not just now but in the future,co make a contribution towards its purchase.<endOfText>
<bot>In other words, that we're spreading out the costs and the charges amongst the people that actually use the services, the road, the school, the particular asset that we erm, would be funding.<endOfText>
<human>I think it's also easy to argue that if you take money out of government allocation for service delivery greater than the amount that is necessary, then actually, the people that are getting in in in the sense of capital schemes, the losers are the people that lose out on front line direct services.<endOfText>
<bot>To give you an example, in nineteen ninety-three, ninety-four, the capital financing standard spending assessment allocation, for Lincolnshire was twenty-three point seven million.<endOfText>
<human>We spent twenty-nine point one million, which was in excess of five point four million.<endOfText>
<bot>That five point four million could have been spent on front line social services, for example.<endOfText>
<human>So in a sense, what we're doing by funding and delivering a very high capital programme out of revenue, rather than borrowing, is we're detracting from our ability to deliver important services.<endOfText>
<bot>I think it's also reasonable to point out, that at the moment, the County Council does enter into finance lease arrangements to meet the business needs, of for example Translink and Computer Services.<endOfText>
<human>It's been accepted that these are credit arrangements under the local government Planning and Land Act, so therefore, it is not unreasonable to argue that borrowing will not represent a new departure for the County Council in terms of being able to control capital spending.<endOfText>
<bot>We can also recognise, as we did, at an, on an earlier paper that it is national government policy and increasingly so, to encourage the development of capital schemes, borrowing, we noted that in relation to transport and the availability of S C A's I think it's also right to say that the government does set down the level of borrowing which can be entered into in in any one year, that is the credit approvals are controlled by the government and they do make them available to the County Council and to district Councils, so in a sense, the government is both saying that we expect borrowing to be a feature of a budget and also that we want to control, and restrict the amount of money that can be borrowed through the amount of credit approvals.<endOfText>
<human>Final reason, is that fo for borrowing, is that we could take a view, that borrowing in a particular year has to take account of the of the valuable circumstances at that particular time.<endOfText>
<bot>We could note, and I think that it's right and prudent to do so, that the current levels of interest rates are at their lowest historically for some twenty years.<endOfText>
<human>They may even go lower, but there's certainly the clear indications from the city that, and from informed sources that interests rates are likely to rise towards the end of this year.<endOfText>
<bot>If that's the case, then we could argue,an and will do, that now is a good time to borrow on a fixed term basis over a long period.<endOfText>
<human>I think to sum up, I would be wanting to say, that this County Council takes a view that it is about the provision of services.<endOfText>
<bot>Important services have to be<endOfText>
<human>given priority.<endOfText>
<bot>When you realise that we have had one of the most difficult spending erm, decisions taken by<endOfText>
<human>National Government, then the time has got to come at so some stage as to whether you defend a principle of Lincolnshire being a de a longer term debt free authority, or whether you look around the county and say, important services must be protected.<endOfText>
<bot>We take a view that this is both so sound financial management and delivery quality services to the people of Lincolnshire.<endOfText>
<human>We think they deserve and want no less.<endOfText>
<bot>Councillor <endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, it's erm, fairly local incident, that this paper has been er borne, er to give the er permission for borrowing, when the labour, liberal er controlling group find themselves in this embarrassing position, er, of having to find an extra eleven million pounds to maintain their services.<endOfText>
<human>They've got themselves into this mess in just nine months.<endOfText>
<bot>Now let me cut through all that science, that er, Councillor Parker has has tried to make this issue.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, budgeting whether it's a five<endOfText>
<bot>er, five hundred million budget, or your own household budget, er, in basic terms, is is fairly simple.<endOfText>
<human>And anyone who has controlled a a household budget, will well understand that in the present sort of climate, that is the real world outside this County Council.<endOfText>
<bot>You have to cut you cloth according to the means.<endOfText>
<human>And when wages and inflation are running at less than two per cent, you don't go out and increase your spending by four or five per cent .<endOfText>
<bot>And you certainly don't go out, and then start economics of the mad-house.<endOfText>
<human>What do you do?<endOfText>
<bot>What do the  the balance very shortly.<endOfText>
<human>Erm  when I think of you and I do, when we're confronted with the challenges in our household budgets.<endOfText>
<bot>You use your Access Cards.<endOfText>
<human>We look at things that we would like to do, and set our priorities.<endOfText>
<bot>Unavoidably, we have to delay some decisions, we put off other decisions, we look at other alternatives, that is the way that you prudently manage budgets.<endOfText>
<human>You do not go out and borrow.<endOfText>
<bot>This County Council under this administration are facing identifying simple economic rules of brevity.<endOfText>
<human>They operate outside.<endOfText>
<bot>Someone else can pick up the bill.<endOfText>
<human>The bottom line is, that if you are having to use Council enforcement to repay interest, you cannot spend the same Council tax revenues in providing services.<endOfText>
<bot>The customer is the people of Lincolnshire that we represent, they are going to lose out by this sort of policy and we oppose the principle of borrowing for these sort of reasons,<endOfText>
<human>are part of it.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you, Chairman, I, firstly I'm indebted to Mr Harrison, here, for a new phrase into the English language, as we're being recorded this morning.<endOfText>
<human>He used the word, shift the incidence of cash flow.<endOfText>
<bot>In other words, that's, covers a multitude of sins, but basically it means, borrowing.<endOfText>
<human>And borrowing means pay later.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm dead against this, er, on principle, I think it's cutting the first sod of the hole that you're preparing to dig yourselves.<endOfText>
<human>Secondly, erm, I am indebted to Councillor Parker for not being mealy-mouthed about this.<endOfText>
<bot>He's saying, quite specifically what his political objective is, and that is, that they can spend more revenue on their political priorities, that they choose to spend it on, and it is a way of transferring capital monies into revenue, and it's as simple as that.<endOfText>
<human>And I object to it,<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Er, can I ask for a point of clarification.<endOfText>
<bot>In the past, er authorities with er er a debt of being limited with the use of their capital receipts.<endOfText>
<human>We are, we are debt free, we've been debt for a long time.<endOfText>
<bot>And I'm against the er policy of borrowing.<endOfText>
<human>I think it's retrogrades debt .<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, I agree with my colleagues for what's been said, so I won't say any more about that, but it is the point that what happens to the capital receipts, in the future.<endOfText>
<human>The position with the County Council is that while  has no long term debt, it has never satisfied the tests of central government, for the capital control regime.<endOfText>
<bot>Which they class as a debt free authority.<endOfText>
<human>That requires two conditions, one that you have no long term debt, and that under the capital control regime which exists on the legislation, you have what is termed a nil or negative credit ceiling.<endOfText>
<bot>Whilst we satisfied one of those conditions, the authorities never satisfied both.<endOfText>
<human>The fact that, one has as a as a council, credit approvals, it does allow you to set them against capital receipts in in further financing new capital works, to the extent that you don't use them for other purposes.<endOfText>
<bot>The government are actually indifferent as to whether you you borrow, and consume your capita er, your credit approvals, or whether you consume your credit approvals by applying them to capital receipts which will be used to buy further capital assets.<endOfText>
<human>Because in their terms, the object of the control regime, is to force down aggregate levels of indebtedness, and there are mechanisms wi within which it works which do that.<endOfText>
<bot>But the County Council still has some longer term debt, not external but internally, that is being paid now and not over time, and so the position actually will not change, so long as the Council continues to have more credit approval than it requires to use the new borrowing.<endOfText>
<human>Can I, can can can I just come back  <endOfText>
<bot>on that.<endOfText>
<human>Wh what what level are are capital approvals?<endOfText>
<bot>What are they running at, erm, you know.<endOfText>
<human>In the last year?<endOfText>
<bot>Over the last year, something over seventeen million, in the forthcoming year there will be a review for about, I think from memory of ar of around about fourteen million.<endOfText>
<human>I think that's supplementary.<endOfText>
<bot>Including the supplementary credit approvals, they're just short of seventeen million.<endOfText>
<human>It's about thirteen point four million basic credit approvals, and about three point three million supplementary credit approvals.<endOfText>
<bot>So it's sixteen point seven million in total.<endOfText>
<human>Councillor <endOfText>
<bot>Yes, thank you.<endOfText>
<human>I hold<endOfText>
<bot>Port erm, borrowing, and I think some Tory members are being disingenuous to say the least on this issue.<endOfText>
<human>It's  Councillor Box said, the mess that you are in.<endOfText>
<bot>This is a direct result of the Tory government cutting our late support grant.<endOfText>
<human>It's not a mess that we're in, it's your Tory government are doing this.<endOfText>
<bot>If you're saying you're not supporting borrowing, it's, I think you've got a duty to say, what services you're going to cut.<endOfText>
<human>If you cannot just go along and say no we're not borrowing and live within your budget as you are saying.<endOfText>
<bot>We're talking about essential services.<endOfText>
<human>In education, for example, we have a a rising pupil numbers.<endOfText>
<bot>We have more children needing <endOfText>
<human><endOfText>
<bot>God,but, no, for ease of er, management, what we'll do is we'll stick to the teams on the tables where you are now.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, working in, what, one team of four and two teams of three.<endOfText>
<bot>Can I ask you though to devise a name that you as a team would wish to be known by, and then I can start er,on the scoreboard.<endOfText>
<human>So?<endOfText>
<bot>March<endOfText>
<human>,<endOfText>
<bot>Right, have you got a name?<endOfText>
<human>The Losers<endOfText>
<bot>The Losers<endOfText>
<human>I should ban that as er, totally unacceptable.<endOfText>
<bot>Middlemarch, because  <endOfText>
<human>No, I mean , The Experts,<endOfText>
<bot>With you, were you all watching? the Experts, yes.<endOfText>
<human>They are mystic, I don't  <endOfText>
<bot>Did you miss it last night then?<endOfText>
<human>Last night.<endOfText>
<bot>So is it Middlemarch or Experts?<endOfText>
<human>Sorry?<endOfText>
<bot>Middlemarch, it's Middlemarch.<endOfText>
<human>It's  to say anything else.<endOfText>
<bot>Young males,march.<endOfText>
<human>And the third team?<endOfText>
<bot>Wall Street.<endOfText>
<human>Wall Street, alright.<endOfText>
<bot>Good.<endOfText>
<human>Now all good teams, all good quizzes have erm, rules.<endOfText>
<bot>And phrases.<endOfText>
<human>Come on this is Abbey Life, come on.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, all quizzes have rules, there's basically just one rule, that anything I say or do is right, but, and that's the rules.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, it seems reasonable?<endOfText>
<bot>Deathly silence.<endOfText>
<human>You're the ombudsman.<endOfText>
<bot>That explains it a bit more then.<endOfText>
<human>What's the difference between  you.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll ask you a question, if you get it right, without any help from your team or anybody else, you're going to get three points for your team.<endOfText>
<human>If you need a little bit of nudging by the people working with you, er, then there's a possible two points for the team.<endOfText>
<bot>If you then pick up a bonus, because the team couldn't answer it maybe, er, you will get a bonus for your team.<endOfText>
<human>However, I am not fair, because the world isn't fair.<endOfText>
<bot>So if for any reason I feel like adding on some points I will do, and equally I'll decide to take some points off if I feel like it.<endOfText>
<human>So, as I say, we go back to rule one, everything I do is right.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes?<endOfText>
<human>O K any questions?<endOfText>
<bot>Excellent.<endOfText>
<human>Looking at me totally confused, that's the best way to start.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, David, we'll start with you then.<endOfText>
<human>We're talking Covermaster here, what's the purpose of the Covermaster Plan?<endOfText>
<bot>Description of it, or purpose of it?<endOfText>
<human>The purpose.<endOfText>
<bot>The purpose.<endOfText>
<human>Er, er, protection.<endOfText>
<bot>Protection, there you are.<endOfText>
<human>Nothing difficult.<endOfText>
<bot>Right John, can you define the Covermaster Plan for me?<endOfText>
<human>Flexible, whole of life,assure <endOfText>
<bot>Almost,Anything, to add to that?<endOfText>
<human>Flexible, whole of life, assurance, anything else?<endOfText>
<bot>Er, la, la, la, la<endOfText>
<human>A little bit of help from your friend.<endOfText>
<bot>Unit linked.<endOfText>
<human>Unit linked.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, yes, yes, yes, right.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, O K, so just the two, for Middlemarch.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, Gerald, here am I, Mrs. Joe Public, and you've got to explain to me unit linking.<endOfText>
<human>Hm, mm, er, basically, er, what actually happens, is with your premiums, each month it buys X amount of units,<endOfText>
<bot>Right,<endOfText>
<human>Er, those units are used to purchase X amount of life cover, depending on how much you w , er, assurance you want in your claim, how much is to go towards savings, how much to go towards, whatever you want in your plan.<endOfText>
<bot>The price of the units are actually allocated, erm, to each of those, in individual areas.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, sort of.<endOfText>
<bot>Sort of, let's think, er, tell me more about the units themselves.<endOfText>
<human>Well the units themselves are actually erm, bought each month.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>And they're actually bought in erm, at the offer price.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>And what you have to, what actually happens, you have what is known as an offer price, and a bid price.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>The offer price is when you buy into the plan, and bid price is when you actually erm, sell.<endOfText>
<bot>O K, excellent, excellent.<endOfText>
<human>I think I'll erm, I'll give you three marks for it, but I'll give you the opportunity for three bonus marks now, because here am I, Mrs. Public, and I didn't understand a word of that.<endOfText>
<bot>I want to know what unit linking will do for me.<endOfText>
<human>Will I actually be buying a unit linking life assurance plan, and not a with profits life assurance plan.<endOfText>
<bot>So what's the benefits for me, in the unit linking?<endOfText>
<human>The benefits for you in unit linking is actually it's going to relate to like the cost of inflation,<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, good.<endOfText>
<human>Erm,Erm, a, a, no, not really, they're qualifying times, erm,<endOfText>
<bot>O K, you pick up a bonus for that, anybody else on the team come up with something positive about unit linking that'll make me say, yes, I like this one?<endOfText>
<human>You er,ma , it balances out the er, benefits from like the whole of the term and it's not necessarily, like a with profits system, you get a lot of bonuses at the very end.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, actually that's very true, that's a v , that's a very good point.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, certainly, I'll give you a point for that.<endOfText>
<bot>Anybody else?<endOfText>
<human>David have you got anything to add?<endOfText>
<bot>No not really,<endOfText>
<human>No, look he's gone to sleep then there,<endOfText>
<bot>,<endOfText>
<human>I agree he's gone to sleep.<endOfText>
<bot>Anybody on this table anything to add?<endOfText>
<human>Eas ,eas , easy travel, easier opportunity for people to, to spread their investment.<endOfText>
<bot>It's an easier way into the stock  market,<endOfText>
<human>So I can invest in the Stock Market without having to be knowledgeable about it?<endOfText>
<bot>yes<endOfText>
<human>And I can spread my investment.<endOfText>
<bot>I like both of those, in fact I'll give you two marks for that.<endOfText>
<human>Because, two things there.<endOfText>
<bot>I can spread the risk between all the various er, homes for the unit linking, funding in invests in, in various assets.<endOfText>
<human>What type of assets?<endOfText>
<bot>this time, what type of assets do er, funds invest in?<endOfText>
<human>Property.<endOfText>
<bot>Property,<endOfText>
<human>Equity<endOfText>
<bot>Stocks<endOfText>
<human>Equity and stocks<endOfText>
<bot>Fixed interest<endOfText>
<human>Fixed interest arrangements, O K, bonus for that team, well done.<endOfText>
<bot>So I can spread the risk by using a variety of investment areas.<endOfText>
<human>It's exactly what you said, and the other thing you said was?<endOfText>
<bot>I can't remember now, spread the risk, and  <endOfText>
<human>I don't have to get  do I?<endOfText>
<bot>No<endOfText>
<human>I don't have to make the decisions.<endOfText>
<bot>Who's making the decisions?<endOfText>
<human>Fund manager<endOfText>
<bot>Fund manager, another bonus, excellent, yes.<endOfText>
<human>O K.<endOfText>
<bot>So we must be getting round to Sue's question.<endOfText>
<human>Oh<endOfText>
<bot>Right Sue, what does it mean, a whole of life policy?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, it means that, you take out the policy for the whole of you life, no matter how long you live, so it keeps going until you die.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, O K.<endOfText>
<human>Erm,<endOfText>
<bot>No that's right.<endOfText>
<human>No, I'll leave it.<endOfText>
<bot>You worked hard for that, you didn't get any points.<endOfText>
<human>Life's not fair, anyway, is it?<endOfText>
<bot>Right, a whole of life, yes, it pays out when you die.<endOfText>
<human>It's not something, like the one term assurance, you know, when you have a policy for ten years, and if you live longer than the ten years, tough.<endOfText>
<bot>You know.<endOfText>
<human>Just your hard luck.<endOfText>
<bot>O K, erm, minimum and maximum ages at entry.<endOfText>
<human>Janet?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, seventeen and seventy one.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, er, seventy.<endOfText>
<bot>Minimum age at entry?<endOfText>
<human>yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Seventeen.<endOfText>
<human>Seventeen, the maximum age?<endOfText>
<bot>Seventy one,next birthday.<endOfText>
<human>Next birthday, next birthday.<endOfText>
<bot>Only the two, you missed off the next birthday.<endOfText>
<human>I will give them a bonus for not making a fuss about losing their marks earlier.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, June, er  four ways that you can write the policy?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, on joint life.<endOfText>
<bot>Joint life.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, own life<endOfText>
<bot>yes<endOfText>
<human>Joint life, last survivor<endOfText>
<bot>yes<endOfText>
<human>And life of the <endOfText>
<bot>Excellent, a little bit of the first one you just said, joint life, if you want to be<endOfText>
<human>First claim<endOfText>
<bot>First claim.<endOfText>
<human>First claim, O K, only the two marks, because he jumped in too quickly there, so you get docked one of your marks you see.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, er, Philip, Philip.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, what's the minimum monthly and annual level premium?<endOfText>
<bot>Er, minimum monthly premium is twenty pounds<endOfText>
<human>Mhm<endOfText>
<bot>And the minimum annual premium is two hundred.<endOfText>
<human>Good.<endOfText>
<bot>Ilias, if the minimum monthly premium is twenty pound a month, level and the minimum annual premium is two hundred pound a month, does that mean if I pay annually I get a discount, it costs me less?<endOfText>
<human>Yes<endOfText>
<bot>Yes,Andrew, what do you reckon?<endOfText>
<human>If yes, at Leyton Buzzard they give discount to pay annually, what do they do in, can't remember, Hanley?<endOfText>
<bot>Well no, because they reckon they'd be, invested two hundred pounds right at the very beginning, you'd most probably make the, the f , fall short over the rest of the year, in the investment.<endOfText>
<human>You're still sort of saying I get a discount really, you're still saying it's only going to cost me two hundred a year.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I suppose so, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>What about in,Haverford West?<endOfText>
<human>Well I would have thought you'd get a discount if you're buying units in the fund then you benefit due to paying annually, if, if you paid in a lump sum erm, you're going to have more units, you know, at the start.<endOfText>
<bot>Which is almost like saying I get a discount.<endOfText>
<human>No, you're still paying the same, it's just  <endOfText>
<bot>Ah, let me put it more clearly, because I don't think I've put the question clearly enough.<endOfText>
<human>Let's say, that me as an individual, if I was erm, buying a Covermaster Plan, for twenty pound a month, the minimum premium, let's say I could get fifty thousand pounds worth of cover.<endOfText>
<bot>If I wanted to pay annually would I still get fifty thousand pounds worth of cover, or would I have to pay two hundred and forty pounds per year?<endOfText>
<human>That's changing the question slightly, so, let's go back to Ilias, what do you reckon?<endOfText>
<bot>Two hundred.<endOfText>
<human>Pardon?<endOfText>
<bot>Two hundred and you get <endOfText>
<human>Two hundred, so you still, you still reckon, you reckon it's a discount?<endOfText>
<bot>yes<endOfText>
<human>O K, er, let's go back to Andrew, how much would I pay for my fifty thousand pounds of cover if I wanted to pay annually, will it cost me two hundred or two forty?<endOfText>
<bot>Two hundred, I still think, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Two hundred, and who's the other person I asked?<endOfText>
<bot>Two hundred.<endOfText>
<human>Two hundred, anybody disagree?<endOfText>
<bot>Go on then.<endOfText>
<human>Sue do you disagree?<endOfText>
<bot>I disagree.<endOfText>
<human>You can have a point for disagreeing because you're right.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, erm, you get what you pay for.<endOfText>
<human>Right, so, if it was going to cost me twenty pound a month for fifty thousand pounds worth of life cover, and I wanted to pay it annually, I'd have to pay it twelve times, I'd have to pay two hundred and forty pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>Minimum premiums are just the smallest amount that Abbey as a company can make a profit on.<endOfText>
<human>So, we could have somebody start at twenty pound a month and we know we can make a profit and we can provide a good service to the clients, a good level of cover.<endOfText>
<bot>When it comes to annually, we will accept two hundred pounds per year as a minimum premium, but in this case, they'd probably get about forty five thousand pounds worth of cover.<endOfText>
<human>They'd get less cover.<endOfText>
<bot>You get what you pay for in this world.<endOfText>
<human>O K, any, any questions?<endOfText>
<bot>Is the difference then because they're saving it in <endOfText>
<human>It's, it's yes, in, in that respect.<endOfText>
<bot>We can make a profit from two hundred pounds a year.<endOfText>
<human>Er, you might just say well why don't we pass that on to the clients, but we don't.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>They, they've got to pay twelve times.<endOfText>
<bot>I think it just gets too complicated when you look at the various contracts.<endOfText>
<human>If you have different levels of payment, it just gets very, very complicated.<endOfText>
<bot>Any fu , everybody happy with that?<endOfText>
<human>Excellent.<endOfText>
<bot>Who had the last question?<endOfText>
<human>Ilias<endOfText>
<bot>Ilias<endOfText>
<human>Who had the last question?<endOfText>
<bot>Ilias<endOfText>
<human>Excellent.<endOfText>
<bot>A bonus for being honest on this team, and being awake.<endOfText>
<human>So it must be Andrew, your question, alright.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, what's the minimum monthly and annual escalating premium?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, Philip or somebody gave me the level premium.<endOfText>
<bot>Well the minimum monthly is still twenty pounds.<endOfText>
<human>Right, so what's the minimum annually, the minimum we can make a profit on?<endOfText>
<bot>I say that's still, still at, still at two hundred pounds again.<endOfText>
<human>Absolutely, tried, I tried to put you off, but I didn't manage it did I.<endOfText>
<bot>O K, good.<endOfText>
<human>So, we must be, are we back with you David, or with you Sue?<endOfText>
<bot>Back with David, ah, right.<endOfText>
<human>How does the escalating premium work?<endOfText>
<bot>Er, increases by ten percent simple interest per year, for the first five years, and then stays level.<endOfText>
<human>Excellent, well done.<endOfText>
<bot>Well done.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's , yes, Shirley?<endOfText>
<human>Can I have the last question?<endOfText>
<bot>How does the escalating premium work then Shirley?<endOfText>
<human>Just as John said.<endOfText>
<bot>John, you got my name wrong.<endOfText>
<human>Next question, John, er, right.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, what's the current, it's a bit d , difficult terminology here, what's the current cost taken out of the fund each month for expenses?<endOfText>
<human>The expense charge is usually it's called, but just occasionally it comes out as policy fee.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, how much is it?<endOfText>
<human>What the actual fee itself?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, in pounds and pence.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, one pound nineteen?<endOfText>
<bot>One pound nineteen, what do you reckon Kim?<endOfText>
<human>I thought it was a percentage?<endOfText>
<bot>Ah, no, this is the bit that comes out annually,<endOfText>
<human>Right<endOfText>
<bot>I know what you're thinking about?<endOfText>
<human>What do you reckon table at the top?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, we'll go along with one nineteen.<endOfText>
<human>You'll go along with one nineteen.<endOfText>
<bot>What about the others?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, you'll go along with it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, absolutely right, yes, well done.<endOfText>
<human>One, two, three.<endOfText>
<bot>Was that me or <endOfText>
<human>No<endOfText>
<bot>Right, erm, ah, I think the best thing we can do is to look at the rate book for this question because you may have remembered it from er,you may not.<endOfText>
<human>Kim, could I ask you to pass those, the Covermaster rate books that  under please.<endOfText>
<bot>You obviously keep taking the rate <endOfText>
<human>No, but, but this, this problem, this was on , this was on  actually.<endOfText>
<bot>Have we got one yet?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, you haven't had them yet.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, and we'll be looking at them later.<endOfText>
<human>That's great, thank's Kim.<endOfText>
<bot>Is the  on the C V T, but again it's, it's easier to look at something when we're talking about this, so I'm going to ask you to look at the Covermaster rate book, which doesn't have page numbers, but I want you to find the allocation to units table which is about four or five pages in.<endOfText>
<human>One, two, no, I'm wrong, three pages in.<endOfText>
<bot>Allocation to units table.<endOfText>
<human>That's right.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, that's right.<endOfText>
<human>Right, everybody there.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, yes, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Allocation to units, third page in.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, this concept is the same whatever product we're talking about, and we'll be talking about four products this weeks, and several more next week.<endOfText>
<human>And I've got to tell you it's erm, an area which they ask questions about very frequently.<endOfText>
<bot>So if we can be quite clear in our minds from now, you might get questions on it tomorrow, you might get questions on it at some point in the future during the week, but they inevitably come at some point.<endOfText>
<human>And we're talking about allocation to units.<endOfText>
<bot>We're talking about how much of the client's premium, let's say he was paying thirty pounds a month, actually ends buying units in his fund.<endOfText>
<human>Now if you look at that table, you can see that it's set out, on the left-hand side, the age at entry, and the top, whether he pays his premiums escalating, or level.<endOfText>
<bot>So the very simple question is, if I wanted a higher allocation to units, who am I asking the question to, Sue is it yours.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, it must be yours, Sue or something.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, it's yours now.<endOfText>
<human>If I wanted to get the highest allocation to units would I pay level or escalating premiums by looking at that table?<endOfText>
<bot>Level<endOfText>
<human>Level.<endOfText>
<bot>Absolutely right.<endOfText>
<human>The question they will ask you, very frequently is, during the first years of the plan, there is a reduced allocation to units.<endOfText>
<bot>They buy less units with the client's premiums.<endOfText>
<human>One the reasons we can see, one the things that affects the allocation you can see, is whether they pay level or escalating.<endOfText>
<bot>You can see on the Covermaster, on an escalating plan, it's twenty percent each year for the first four years.<endOfText>
<human>So only twenty percent, only one fifth of this client's premium is going to buy units in those first four years.<endOfText>
<bot>So only six pounds a month is actually going to get invested in his fund in the first four years.<endOfText>
<human>After that the total amounts, or even a bit more if we look at it, erm, what over factor, Janet, no John, it must be John's turn now, affects the allocation to units in those first four years by looking at that table.<endOfText>
<bot>One is where they pay in escalating or level, the other, what else affects the allocation?<endOfText>
<human>Have you got it from the tables.<endOfText>
<bot>Is age.<endOfText>
<human>It's age, yes,<endOfText>
<bot>I would have said that, I would have said that, I thought it was too easy.<endOfText>
<human>I know, I know.<endOfText>
<bot>Well I like to make things easy for you John.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, two marks.<endOfText>
<human>Because you can see if the client's up to the age of forty, he gets a higher erm, a reduced allocation, but if he's seventy, he gets actually forty percent allocated in the first year, and he gets er, a full allocation from then on.<endOfText>
<bot>So those two factors affect how much of the client's premium buys units in the first four years.<endOfText>
<human>Whether they pay level or escalating premiums and his age.<endOfText>
<bot>Income might  insurance his age, and other things it might be the term of the policy, we're looking at how long he pays it, because if you think, Covermaster, his age affects the term.<endOfText>
<human>If somebody takes a Covermaster plan out at twenty five, we expect them to be paying it for a long time, if he takes it out at fifty five, we expect him to pay less.<endOfText>
<bot>Philip?<endOfText>
<human>Th, the ag , the maximum age of entry is seventy one, next birthday isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>Why on the, hm, why on the chart do they show it seventy one to a hundred and five?<endOfText>
<bot>Because people can still be paying their premiums once they go past seventy one, they haven't got to cash it in.<endOfText>
<human>So you're say , ah, right, no it's just a , er, it says next birthday, at entry it says <endOfText>
<bot>It says in the first b , yes well, mm, it doesn't make sense, because they can't have it after seventy one can they? er, initially.<endOfText>
<human>O K, so those are the two factors that affect the allocation to units in the first four years.<endOfText>
<bot>The next question's got to be to Kim, if only six pounds of his premium is buying units in, if he has an escalating plan in his first four years, what's the other twenty four pounds going towards?<endOfText>
<human>Administration<endOfText>
<bot>Administration, yes, which is a nice way of putting it.<endOfText>
<human>Another way of putting it?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, the associate's commission.<endOfText>
<human>Absolutely.<endOfText>
<bot>One, two, three and a bonus.<endOfText>
<human>It's the type of client, life assurance clients are the type of client where the commission's all come out in the first four years.<endOfText>
<bot>Which is why the clients are sold a plan inappropriately and they cash it in, they get very little back.<endOfText>
<human>Your commissions are paid by the client over those first four years.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, that accounts for the reduced allocation and the setting up fees as well.<endOfText>
<human>But it's main , it's mainly your commission.<endOfText>
<bot>Now if you've got somebody who you are protecting their family, and they'll be paying that plan twenty five years or more, the fact that they pay commissions out for the first four years is immaterial, what they want is peace of mind and protection.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, it could have been spread out over the whole twenty five years as it is with other products, but in life assurance at the moment, it's out of those first four years.<endOfText>
<bot>But you can see why if you're selling inappropriately, if you sell someone for example, a savings plan, and they cash it in the first four years, and they don't even get what they paid in it, how they're going to be very annoyed, because from what they could see, they were getting a savings plan.<endOfText>
<human>If it runs for the ten years, they're going to out-perform the banks and building societies, and they're going to be very happy.<endOfText>
<bot>So appropriately sold, there is no problem, but if it's not appropriately sold, you can see that people really do, don't get back what they put in.<endOfText>
<human>So that's the allocation to units.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, and I've just asked John, so I must be now with, no I've just asked Kim, so I must be now with Philip.<endOfText>
<human>Yes?<endOfText>
<bot>Philip, looking at that page, erm, after the first four years, two other factors affect the allocation to units, and that information is in the bottom of that second page.<endOfText>
<human>Can you give me one of them.<endOfText>
<bot>And obviously Janet, you'll be giving me the other one, so if you can take the time to look at it.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, well it's the er, year ruler.<endOfText>
<bot>Absolutely,<endOfText>
<human>Yes, it's the sex.<endOfText>
<bot>It's the sex  Do you  sex <endOfText>
<human>It's the sex that does it <endOfText>
<bot>It's the sex that does it.<endOfText>
<human>What's this,or something.<endOfText>
<bot>Or even if?<endOfText>
<human>Or even if.<endOfText>
<bot>It great  that you've got me totally confused here.<endOfText>
<human>Erm.<endOfText>
<bot>It actually is part of the answer that if,you quite amaze me <endOfText>
<human>Yes, a combination of er, of age and sex really.<endOfText>
<bot>Er,a male, a male up to erm, well, a male or female up to erm.<endOfText>
<human>If you jump, yes you're looking at the right place, but you've jumped ahead.<endOfText>
<bot>What is determined by the client's age and gender?<endOfText>
<human>Right, oh, the er, the amount of erm, additional units or looking <endOfText>
<bot>Not quite , not quite, he's jumped ahead a little bit, can you help him out on the table?<endOfText>
<human>Waiver of premium.<endOfText>
<bot>It's waiver of premium.<endOfText>
<human>Absolutely, so it's the cost of waiver of premium.<endOfText>
<bot>Waiver of premium you know, as a benefit, you know about waiver of premium.<endOfText>
<human>I'll pick it up later.<endOfText>
<bot>But it's the one thing that actually comes out of the premium before the units are bought, because it's a percentage.<endOfText>
<human>And it's a percentage of the premium so it's a fixed amount.<endOfText>
<bot>And if you look at the bottom of that table, somebody up to the age of thirty nine, will pay two percent of their premium erm, for the waiver of premium benefit.<endOfText>
<human>Anybody from forty to forty nine, will pay three percent and then they've got this strange idea that ladies over the age of fifty are going to have more time off work through illness, so they're going to charge us four percent, and the men three percent.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, that's the cost to waiver of premiums.<endOfText>
<human>So Janet, your question, which is not as I in , intimated it might be at all, so you, you can be well annoyed, erm, if you're setting up a, a joint life policy with waiver premium on both people, and the wife is fifty one, and the husband is forty, how much will be deducted from their units according to waiver of premiums?<endOfText>
<bot>Take the wife's age, the wife is forty three?<endOfText>
<human>The, the wife is fifty one, and the husband is forty.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, I get, yes I see, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Erm,seven percent.<endOfText>
<bot>Seven percent, you have to add them together.<endOfText>
<human>You have to add the cost of waiver on a joint life policy, you have to add, add the costs together.<endOfText>
<bot>Absolutely.<endOfText>
<human>Good.<endOfText>
<bot>She even got round giving me the wrong answer first, which I thought was quite subtle.<endOfText>
<human>Well done.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, so the next question must come to, to John, or is it Kim, it must be Andrew.<endOfText>
<human>It must be Andrew, right.<endOfText>
<bot>Looking at that page, once the plan has been set up, after those first four years, whether the client has waiver of premium or not, actually affects the allocations to units.<endOfText>
<human>We've established that's a nice table there to tell you.<endOfText>
<bot>There's one other factor, at the bottom of that, er page, will tell you something about the allocation to units.<endOfText>
<human>If they don't have the waiver of premiums they get more units, because the more money goes into the er, whatsit.<endOfText>
<bot>Absolutely true.<endOfText>
<human>But it wasn't what I was asking, so I'm going to give you the points, but it's absolutely true.<endOfText>
<bot>So we must move on to Philip, no?<endOfText>
<human>Not again.<endOfText>
<bot>Not again, it must be John then, John?<endOfText>
<human>Oh, sorry.<endOfText>
<bot>No, no, it's good.<endOfText>
<human>David<endOfText>
<bot>David, it's David.<endOfText>
<human>You ought to get a bonus scheme up just for that.<endOfText>
<bot>No, no, no, no, no, no.<endOfText>
<human>That's too generous.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, what other factor, other than whether they have waiver of premium or not affects the allocation to units.<endOfText>
<human>Well wriggled there Andrew, that was er, a good wriggling effort.<endOfText>
<bot>Read another page.<endOfText>
<human>Total premium.<endOfText>
<bot>Ah right, what about the total premium?<endOfText>
<human>Well whether it's up to, seven hundred and seventy nine pounds ninety nine P per annum ,<endOfText>
<bot>yes<endOfText>
<human>Erm, if it's up to that, it's a hundred and three percent.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>And if it's seven hundred and eighty per annum, or seventy pounds per month, er, and, and over, it's a hundred and four.<endOfText>
<bot>Absolutely, how much they pay?<endOfText>
<human>Throughout our policies, anybody paying up to seventy eight pounds a month gets one allocation, anybody who can afford, and will pay more than seventy eight pounds a month will get a higher allocation.<endOfText>
<bot>An extra one percent.<endOfText>
<human>Right, this will keep coming up throughout the er, products.<endOfText>
<bot>Can we just be clear in our minds before we move on, how it affects.<endOfText>
<human>We're talking about the allocation of the premium to buy units.<endOfText>
<bot>Two factors affect it in the first four years.<endOfText>
<human>That's whether you pay level or escalating and the age of the client.<endOfText>
<bot>After that, throughout the rest of the term, they have a reduced allocation if they have waiver of premium, and they have an increased allocation if they pay more than seventy eight pounds a month, or seven hundred and eighty pounds a year.<endOfText>
<human>So the premium level and whether or not they have wa , waiver of the premium affects it.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, next question, John?<endOfText>
<human>You have a client who has waiver of premium <endOfText>
<bot>And he's still paying his premium for his Covermaster, will we actually give him more units?<endOfText>
<human>No<endOfText>
<bot>No we don't.<endOfText>
<human>We don't actually make up, he still carries on paying the same, we don't, we don't increase the allocation, when he gets to sixty, or sixty five or whenever.<endOfText>
<bot>So, where are we John.<endOfText>
<human>One, two, three, well done.<endOfText>
<bot>Any questions on allocations before we move on?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, how do you decide on a hundred and three or a hundred or four for allocation?<endOfText>
<bot>Just to be awkward.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, literally, you'll get, er, you invest the thirty thousand units, er, and you'll get a hundred and three pounds extra percent of the money of the money invested.<endOfText>
<bot>So if three percent is, what, I don't know, what is it, ninety P or something?<endOfText>
<human>You get an extra ninety P, buying units for you.<endOfText>
<bot>Alright.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, we've just asked John so we must be now with Kim, are we?<endOfText>
<bot>No we're not, we're with Gerald <endOfText>
<human>Gerald <endOfText>
<bot>Gerald, yes, absolutely.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, we have a client, we do have clients, we have lots of client.<endOfText>
<bot>We have a client, who shall we have as the client?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, right, we'll have Shirley as the client, and we're a life company and we're looking at the cost of providing Shirley with life cover.<endOfText>
<bot>So we're looking at the amount we take out of her plan each month to cover for life cover.<endOfText>
<human>We call it the life cover charge, or technically, er, a phrase I'm sure you're used it, the mortality reduction.<endOfText>
<bot>What factors will we take into account when we're assessing the cost of life cover for Shirley?<endOfText>
<human>We take into account her age.<endOfText>
<bot>Age, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, the level of life cover required.<endOfText>
<bot>Absolutely.<endOfText>
<human>The level of cover required, good.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, medical factors.<endOfText>
<human>Health, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, occupation.<endOfText>
<human>Occupation, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, there's one more I think.<endOfText>
<human>So we look at the age, look at the level of cover, health, you look healthy Shirley, are you in good health?<endOfText>
<bot>Right,occ , you don't do any dangerous occupations, not a steel scaffolder or anything?<endOfText>
<human>You know?<endOfText>
<bot>No<endOfText>
<human>I think sex on premiums.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, the premiums, we do take into account sex or gender, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, it actually affects the, the rate.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes<endOfText>
<human>But it is taken into account if we're talking about the cost of life cover.<endOfText>
<bot>One more.<endOfText>
<human>Anybody on the table?<endOfText>
<bot>Hobbies and pastimes.<endOfText>
<human>Hobbies and pastimes.<endOfText>
<bot>Have you got any dangerous pastimes, Shirley?<endOfText>
<human>I go hand-gliding.<endOfText>
<bot>You go hand-gliding.<endOfText>
<human>Right <endOfText>
<bot>One, two.<endOfText>
<human>Just the two, because er, Andrew helped you out.<endOfText>
<bot>Good.<endOfText>
<human>Actually, er, as a point, if you find a client who goes hand-gliding, who goes stock car racing, don't always assume that they're going to be rated, you just submit it to the underwriters, and they make their own decision.<endOfText>
<bot>I've got a client who races stock cars, but as he only does it three or four times a year, they don't actually charge him any extra at all.<endOfText>
<human>So, it's not essential, but we will look at it.<endOfText>
<bot>Good, well done.<endOfText>
<human>Right, erm, Philip, Susan<endOfText>
<bot>It's me I think.<endOfText>
<human>Sue, Sue, yes?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, when can a client claim under the terminal illness ben , benefit?<endOfText>
<human>What illnesses do you mean?<endOfText>
<bot>No not what illnesses, terminal illness.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, Terminal illness, oh, sorry.<endOfText>
<bot>When can he, when can he claim?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, if he's been going to er, erm, in the unlikely, er, twelve months , that it's unlikely that he's going to have more than twelve months to live.<endOfText>
<bot>yes, if he's been diagnosed as er, as a terminal illness.<endOfText>
<human>I E, he's likely to die within the next twelve months.<endOfText>
<bot>Then the sum assured is payable, just as if he had actually had died.<endOfText>
<human>O K, good.<endOfText>
<bot>Sorry, just a quick question there.<endOfText>
<human>The , there's two , there's two parts of it,tw , a diagnosis and twelve months?<endOfText>
<bot>Well,th , the definition of a terminal illness as regards that is, according to the underwriters, is that the client's life is likely to die in the next twelve months.<endOfText>
<human>Right, O K, I understood it was the time factor that was , right.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, that's when, that's when they put no limit on it.<endOfText>
<human>Right, erm, Reviews.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, reviews, reviews, we're up, Sue, so it must be,<endOfText>
<human>John.<endOfText>
<bot>John<endOfText>
<human>John again, right.<endOfText>
<bot>When are the reviews held on a Covermaster Plan?<endOfText>
<human>Ten, five and one.<endOfText>
<bot>Ten, five and one, mm, interesting.<endOfText>
<human>Explain.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, right.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, on the tenth anniversary of the<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, good.<endOfText>
<human>The policy.<endOfText>
<bot>yes<endOfText>
<human>Every five years after the age of  fifty or fifty five, I can't remember quite which, and then one year after the age of, after sixty five.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, and one other time.<endOfText>
<human>Er, pass.<endOfText>
<bot>The end of the erm,<endOfText>
<human>yes, right<endOfText>
<bot>The selected time, the time, the selected period <endOfText>
<human>The selected period, good.<endOfText>
<bot>The first review's after ten years, then every five years up to the age of sixty five, then annually.<endOfText>
<human>But if you get to the end of the selected period, there's always one.<endOfText>
<bot>But, I, I misunderstood, I obviously got it wrong then.<endOfText>
<human>I thought it was at the tenth anniversary, every five years after that, I didn't realise that came into, John said it was.<endOfText>
<bot>yes, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Up to the age of sixty five.<endOfText>
<bot>Up to the age of sixty five, and then<endOfText>
<human>Oh I'm sorry I misunderstood John, then I've <endOfText>
<bot>And then, and then annually after that.<endOfText>
<human>yes, I thought he said, after the age of fifty five,<endOfText>
<bot>I did<endOfText>
<human>He did, yes<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Some people have<endOfText>
<bot>Then the extra five  for  up<endOfText>
<human>There you have, let's have it back for honesty.<endOfText>
<bot>No, no, you were only honest because they made you be honest.<endOfText>
<human>Right, I er, I heard you say the right answer, so I was obviously incorrect.<endOfText>
<bot>But is everybody quite clear then?<endOfText>
<human>The first one at ten, every five years up to the age of sixty five, then annually, and there's one at the end of the selected period.<endOfText>
<bot>O K.<endOfText>
<human>Good, Kim, erm, how does the client, oh, what is the selected period?<endOfText>
<bot>It's defined at the onset of the policy.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm<endOfText>
<bot>The ten period being the qualifying period.<endOfText>
<human>So for a minimum of ten years.<endOfText>
<bot>yes.<endOfText>
<human>Or whatever, erm, the client chooses, to cover the specific period of their life, that they need life cover for.<endOfText>
<bot>Absolutely right, good.<endOfText>
<human>So, in effect, it could look like that, yes?<endOfText>
<bot>. Where we have a client who has a need for the first ten years for it looks like a hundred and ninety thousand pounds worth of life cover, at the end of the ten year period, the need is reduced, maybe the children have left home, so sum assu , assured reduces down to, in this case, it looks like to be about fifty thousand for the rest of the time.<endOfText>
<human>Good, well done.<endOfText>
<bot>Can I ask another quick question?<endOfText>
<human>In practice, does that happen very often?<endOfText>
<bot>That people will, will deliberately put it down half way through the term?<endOfText>
<human>Well let's, let's before we answer that, let me ask erm, Philip a question.<endOfText>
<bot>We get to the end of the selected period,<endOfText>
<human>Yes<endOfText>
<bot>What options does the client have?<endOfText>
<human>Well he can er, he can come down to the original reduced figure.<endOfText>
<bot>Absolutely, yes<endOfText>
<human>Er, or with erm, with further, further underwriting, he can er, subject to further underwriting, he can er, choose er, an additional <endOfText>
<bot>He's chewing his , he's chewing <endOfText>
<human>He's woffling, he's woffling, he's woffling.<endOfText>
<bot>So well, how do we do it?<endOfText>
<human>He can either erm, continue at the same level, but he pays more premiums.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, he can continue at that level of a hundred and ninety but he's obviously going to have to pay more, because he's only paid for it for ten years, or he can reduce it down to the original amount.<endOfText>
<human>Is that, that's not what I said is it?<endOfText>
<bot>No it's not what you said.<endOfText>
<human>I'm not going to repeat what you said.<endOfText>
<bot>But to allow you to get a bonus point, if he continues at the same level, will we require further annualising from him.<endOfText>
<human>For a hundred and ninety thousand?<endOfText>
<bot>No<endOfText>
<human>No<endOfText>
<bot>Who answered?<endOfText>
<human>These two.<endOfText>
<bot>I didn't, I didn't.<endOfText>
<human>I thought the three of you did very well thank you, because you're absolutely right.<endOfText>
<bot>You don't need any further underwriting to carry on at that level, but you can do.<endOfText>
<human>Two bonus points for ventriloquism and <endOfText>
<bot>No, why not, why not.<endOfText>
<human>Come on yes, one for ventriloquism.<endOfText>
<bot>O K.<endOfText>
<human>Er, where am I, Janet, have you got missed out somewhere along the line, but never mind.<endOfText>
<bot>And you, oh, I see, I'm sorry,<endOfText>
<human>No, I'd noticed, it's Janet's turn now, but I think I missed you out, oh well, anyway, forget it.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, what happens if a client has, has established er, a Covermaster Plan for a selected period, and then for whatever reason, has a need to increase that cover.<endOfText>
<human>Maybe has another child, maybe a better lifestyle that they need to protect.<endOfText>
<bot>What can they actually do?<endOfText>
<human>They do, they probably ask for erm,<endOfText>
<bot>Well what,wh , can they actually increase this on their, their plan, increase their plan further?<endOfText>
<human>Table can you help?<endOfText>
<bot>yes<endOfText>
<human>yes<endOfText>
<bot>They can increase their plan further, what effect would that actually have to the plan though?<endOfText>
<human>To the selected period?<endOfText>
<bot>Reduce the plan.<endOfText>
<human>To the selected period.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm<endOfText>
<human>Ah, oh Christ now,<endOfText>
<bot>He's going, woffle time, woffle time, are we ready?<endOfText>
<human>I'm sorry, I'm thinking about it, right.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, the selected period gets adjusted then.<endOfText>
<human>It does yes.<endOfText>
<bot>No but I mean it becomes, it becomes shorter.<endOfText>
<human>It becomes shorter, yes, you're absolutely right.<endOfText>
<bot>And this scenario, we've got a client who started with er, it looks like a hundred and fifty thousand pounds worth of life cover, after five years he had a further need, perhaps erm, a further child or, as I say, er, a lifestyle increase or whatever.<endOfText>
<human>So he wanted more life cover, but he obviously on his old plan couldn't sustain that to the same period of time, so he had it for a shorter period of time, the ten years, and when it dropped, he dropped down again.<endOfText>
<bot>So what you actually do, is have a higher level of cover but for a shorter selected period, to fit in with your circumstances.<endOfText>
<human>O K.<endOfText>
<bot>Good, I think we'll give you the marks for that one then John.<endOfText>
<human>Er, we must now be with Andrew.<endOfText>
<bot>Question, you go to see Mr. and Mrs. Client tonight, and they need, let's say they need a hundred thousand pounds worth of life cover, and to fit their lifestyle, or their children, their family, they need it for eighteen years, they can't afford that.<endOfText>
<human>Would you give them a hundred thousand pounds worth of life cover for a shorter period, looking at them making up the difference perhaps later when they could afford it, or would you give them initially a reduced amount of life cover, say eighty thousand, for the eighteen years?<endOfText>
<bot>What do you think would constitute best advice?<endOfText>
<human>, I think perhaps give them the, the shorter years.<endOfText>
<bot>You're absolutely right, er, you're absolutely right, so where are you?<endOfText>
<human>One, two, three, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>If this is what they need now, this is what you give them, er, on the understanding that perhaps they only have it for fifteen or ten years, but in fifteen or ten years' time, they might well be able to afford to extend it and pay more.<endOfText>
<human>So it makes sense doesn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>You're doing er, the best for your clients.<endOfText>
<human>Good.<endOfText>
<bot>Well done.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, right, oh, er, John, it must be, must be John, because er, must be David, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>I think you left it too late<endOfText>
<human>Might even be John.<endOfText>
<bot>David erm,<endOfText>
<human>He's this Welsh twit on the right<endOfText>
<bot>Did he, did he <endOfText>
<human>No, no, he did get the right to <endOfText>
<bot>I, I'd ask the <endOfText>
<human>It must be definitely a point off for racism here.<endOfText>
<bot>Absolutely.<endOfText>
<human>I was just trying to help you really.<endOfText>
<bot>you see, I was trying to help you.<endOfText>
<human>You were trying to help me put the names in place, without finishing it off.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, bit of nice creeping there, but it didn't work, John.<endOfText>
<human>O K, so David, at what stage can you claim under a terminal illness benefit, for a joint life, last survivor plan?<endOfText>
<bot>At what stage can you claim for a terminal<endOfText>
<human>Illness benefit on a joint life, last survivor plan?<endOfText>
<bot>You can't get it.<endOfText>
<human>You're absolutely right.<endOfText>
<bot>Sue was desperate to tell you, but, absolutely desperate.<endOfText>
<human>Not available on a joint life, last survivor plan.<endOfText>
<bot>You're absolutely right.<endOfText>
<human>Good.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, at what age must the selected period finish, Philip?<endOfText>
<human>It starts a minimum of ten years, but what age must it always finish by?<endOfText>
<bot>Thirty five.<endOfText>
<human>Er, that's how long it can be, but it, as regards the client's age?<endOfText>
<bot>It can be, it can run from ten to thirty five years, but it can't run past a client being a certain age?<endOfText>
<human>Team?<endOfText>
<bot>Sixty five<endOfText>
<human>Sixty<endOfText>
<bot>Fifty five<endOfText>
<human>It's one of those three anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>Any, any, er, anybody else?<endOfText>
<human>Everybody put up your hands.<endOfText>
<bot>Fifty five?<endOfText>
<human>Sixty five?<endOfText>
<bot>Seventy five.<endOfText>
<human>Seventy five.<endOfText>
<bot>Sixty<endOfText>
<human>Sixty<endOfText>
<bot>Seventy one<endOfText>
<human>Seventy one<endOfText>
<bot>Anybody anything else?<endOfText>
<human>Fifty eight and a half.<endOfText>
<bot>O K, that's I'm sorry, that won't go, go for that one.<endOfText>
<human>Well done, seventy five.<endOfText>
<bot>Bonus for Gerald.<endOfText>
<human>Taken at the end.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, but I will give you a mark for saying it's ten to thirty five years because you're absolutely right, it can be established for thirty five years.<endOfText>
<human>Right, O K, erm, Gerald, policy reviews.<endOfText>
<bot>Policy reviews.<endOfText>
<human>Why are they carried out?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, to make sure that the sum assured that the clients have got, or the funds can actually meet it, erm,<endOfText>
<human>Absolutely, absolutely, you're looking at  the sum assured that the client has got, being supported by the fund.<endOfText>
<bot>I E, you can take the charges out regularly and sustain the life cover.<endOfText>
<human>So who actually holds the reviews?<endOfText>
<bot>The company or the client?<endOfText>
<human>Er, the company has to review<endOfText>
<bot>The company.<endOfText>
<human>It's a company thing.<endOfText>
<bot>You will actually hold a policy review with your client, I E, you're going to see them each year at least, but the policy reviews as regards the company are held to make sure there's enough growth in the client's funds to sustain all the charges.<endOfText>
<human>Excellent.<endOfText>
<bot>So, er, Sue, what amount of growth are we looking at, traditionally or historically with Abbey to er, be able to do that?<endOfText>
<human>Er, eight point two five.<endOfText>
<bot>Eight point two five.<endOfText>
<human>These questions are obviously getting far too easy, you're er, answering them so well.<endOfText>
<bot>How many funds, Shirley, may the clients invest in initially, if they choose?<endOfText>
<human>Well we all <endOfText>
<bot>Well we all put five initially, but we were told you could put it up to ten.<endOfText>
<human>Initially.<endOfText>
<bot>Five<endOfText>
<human>Five, you're right.<endOfText>
<bot>Initially, five.<endOfText>
<human>Once the policy's established, up to ten.<endOfText>
<bot>O K.<endOfText>
<human>Kim, what fund would you recommend your clients put their money, in er, with a, with a Covermaster Plan?<endOfText>
<bot>A managed fund.<endOfText>
<human>A managed fund, absolutely.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, erm, what happens then, Philip, if the client says to you, and it's unlikely with Covermaster, but it's the same principle if you're talking of a savings plan or a pension, erm, I don't like the idea of my money being invested in a managed fund, I've been reading the financial press, and I'm very interested and excited at the thought of the Japanese market going up through the roof.<endOfText>
<human>So I would like to invest my Covermaster money in the Japanese funds.<endOfText>
<bot>Can you do that?<endOfText>
<human>What would you do?<endOfText>
<bot>What's the circumstances?<endOfText>
<human>How would you cover your back etcetera, etcetera,<endOfText>
<bot>Tell him, you can only, you can only advise you to actually invest in the managed fund.<endOfText>
<human>But I'm your client saying I don't want that advice.<endOfText>
<bot>If you choose, if you choose to invest in other funds, it's entirely up to you again.<endOfText>
<human>The choice is yours.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, right.<endOfText>
<human>But how are you going to cover your back if I?<endOfText>
<bot>I'd certainly need to er, er, need to make a comment to that effect on the back binding at the end of the side <endOfText>
<human>Absolutely.<endOfText>
<bot>Because how does Philip know that in five years' time, I'm not going to ring him up and say, hey you know when you recommended me to invest my money in the Japanese fund, well it's just gone through the bottom of the market.<endOfText>
<human>That was bad advice, etcetera, etcetera.<endOfText>
<bot>So, if the clients want to invest in a fund, they can do.<endOfText>
<human>You can advise them whether they decide your advice that's fine, but what you must do is get them to s , you must write it on the plan your future document, the advice you gave, what plan you decided to do, and I would actually get him to initial it as well.<endOfText>
<bot>O K?<endOfText>
<human>Good.<endOfText>
<bot>So we now must be with John.<endOfText>
<human>John, when can the client change their fund allocation?<endOfText>
<bot>So let's say this client has got his thirty pounds a month Covermaster, er, and he's decided that he wants to invest his Covermaster in a Japan fund.<endOfText>
<human>And he wants to change his allocation, what do we mean by that, and when can he do it?<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know when he can do it.<endOfText>
<human>Think now.<endOfText>
<bot>At any time.<endOfText>
<human>At any time.<endOfText>
<bot>And what does it actually mean?<endOfText>
<human>I think it's,it's probably put into any chosen fund.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's say he wants a managed fund.<endOfText>
<human>O K.<endOfText>
<bot>Now what are we actually talking about by changing?<endOfText>
<human>Something being, the, the units in one fund at the market price, for the er, units in the other fund  <endOfText>
<bot>Oh you mean tip in those into, from the Japanese fund into the managed fund.<endOfText>
<human>Tipping them from one bucket to the next?<endOfText>
<bot>Well<endOfText>
<human>Mm<endOfText>
<bot>Change them from fund to fund.<endOfText>
<human>Change them from fund to fund, mm.<endOfText>
<bot>A bit of confusion.<endOfText>
<human>Can you help out this table?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, the value, what you'd actually do, the value of the Japanese fund at the bid price,, would be allocated to the, at the bid price to the managed fund.<endOfText>
<human>It would be the amount of I would anticipate the managed fund.<endOfText>
<bot>And what do we call that?<endOfText>
<human>We call it a bid to bid, or a switch fund <endOfText>
<bot>Switching.<endOfText>
<human>Which was a wonderful explanation, and absolutely true.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you know how much it costs, Gerald, to switch?<endOfText>
<human>Around eigh , nothing for the first one, and eighteen pounds after that one.<endOfText>
<bot>No it's all eighteen actually.<endOfText>
<human>It's all eighteen.<endOfText>
<bot>Brilliant answer, but he didn't answer the question I asked.<endOfText>
<human>Which was?<endOfText>
<bot>I asked about changing.<endOfText>
<human>That's absolutely true about switching.<endOfText>
<bot>What about changing?<endOfText>
<human>Future allocations.<endOfText>
<bot>Future<endOfText>
<human>Future allocations, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>So here we are in January, my premiums are going into the Japanese fund, I want next month's, February's to go into the managed, that's just changing, and it leaves these Japanese funds invested, here.<endOfText>
<human>If I want to switch I tip from one bucket to the other, we'll charge him eighteen pounds, and we're absolutely right, as Gerald says, we do it on a bid to bid basis.<endOfText>
<bot>So changing into the future, you can do it at any time, what it actually means, it'll affects the next month's premiums, and switching, er, it's on a bid to bid basis, from one fund to the other, and we charge them eighteen pounds per occasion.<endOfText>
<human>Can I have a point please.<endOfText>
<bot>What's this?<endOfText>
<human>Shall I give him a point?<endOfText>
<bot>no, no <endOfText>
<human>We said no, I, I, I'm doing everything that table says at the moment, so no, but I'm going to give one to Shirley because she got most of the answer and then she came back with the right bit at the end as well.<endOfText>
<bot>So, right, switching and changing.<endOfText>
<human>O K.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, let me just have a quick look through and see what I've asked those, definitely.<endOfText>
<human>Right, er, David, surrender value? end of side one.<endOfText>
<bot>Would you like a bit of advice?<endOfText>
<human>No, no,, we knew, we knew.<endOfText>
<bot>We said no, oh, I, I, I'm doing everything that table says at the moment, so no, but I'm going to give one to Shirley because she got most of the answer and then she came back with the right bit at the end as well.<endOfText>
<human>So, right, switching and changing.<endOfText>
<bot>O K.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, let me just have a quick look through and see what I've asked first, definitely.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, er, David, surrender value.<endOfText>
<human>A client wants to take, to cash in their plan, what do they get?<endOfText>
<bot>What do they get?<endOfText>
<human>They get the bid price of the units in the fund, their allocation of the units in the fund.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>If they want to cash in their plan, any units they've got allocated to their fund, they get the bid price.<endOfText>
<bot>Brilliant, O K.<endOfText>
<human>Erm,John, no.<endOfText>
<bot>Janet, if somebody wants to take a partial surrender, I E, some of the cash from their fund, can they do it and how much will we charge them?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, they can.<endOfText>
<bot>I was sort of telling you that bit.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, er, eleven pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>Absolutely, right.<endOfText>
<human>Excellent.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, an investment bonus, Kim, is paid, how much is it, and when is it paid?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, an investment bonus is paid annually.<endOfText>
<bot>That would be nice, but no.<endOfText>
<human>Ah,<endOfText>
<bot>It would be nice.<endOfText>
<human>No<endOfText>
<bot>Could your team help Kim out?<endOfText>
<human>The pay five, er, the amount if five percent,<endOfText>
<bot>yes<endOfText>
<human>And it's paid after the client's seventy fifth birthday<endOfText>
<bot>Brilliant<endOfText>
<human>Providing the plan has been going for ten years.<endOfText>
<bot>Brilliant.<endOfText>
<human>Five percent bonus, should the client reach seventy five, and still be hail and hearty, and paying his premiums.<endOfText>
<bot>Excellent.<endOfText>
<human>O K.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, let's go back to our fund and the list of charges.<endOfText>
<human>We've looked at the expense charge of one pound nineteen, the cost of running a policy taken out each month.<endOfText>
<bot>We've established that if Shirley was our client, the cost of life cover would be taken out each month, erm, Sue can you give me another charge, that is levied?<endOfText>
<human>David's trying desperately to throw his voice again.<endOfText>
<bot>It's a terrible scheme.<endOfText>
<human>I don't know.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes, the initial management charge.<endOfText>
<human>The initial management charge, how much is that?<endOfText>
<bot>How much?<endOfText>
<human>Mm<endOfText>
<bot>Bid offer  about five percent.<endOfText>
<human>Which is?<endOfText>
<bot>five percent.<endOfText>
<human>Five percent bid offer .<endOfText>
<bot>O K, well done, David, but no points for cheating.<endOfText>
<human>No points for cheating, but you're absolutely right.<endOfText>
<bot>The difference between the buying price and the selling price, five percent.<endOfText>
<human>Which is the buying and which is the selling price, Ilias, of the units?<endOfText>
<bot>The bid price, or the offer price?<endOfText>
<human>It would be the offer price, the price of the company.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes<endOfText>
<human>And the bid price, the price that the er, client.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, yes.<endOfText>
<human>The bid price is what the company will give the client, and the offer price is which the client has to buy off the company.<endOfText>
<bot>Bid to get rid, so bid is the selling price, is the easy way to remember it.<endOfText>
<human>O K, good.<endOfText>
<bot>One, two, three.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, Andrew, another charge, you've got the initial management charge, one more?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm,<endOfText>
<human>Team?<endOfText>
<bot>Waiver of premiums, no we've done that.<endOfText>
<human>We've done it.<endOfText>
<bot>We've got that.<endOfText>
<human>We've got the expenses charge.<endOfText>
<bot>You're right, it is a charge.<endOfText>
<human>Er, setting up charge?<endOfText>
<bot>Establishment of <endOfText>
<human>The, er adding charge.<endOfText>
<bot>Annual management charge, taken out of the fund.<endOfText>
<human>How much is it?<endOfText>
<bot>One percent.<endOfText>
<human>Did you hear him?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes<endOfText>
<human>One percent, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Phew, given them their bonus, yes, well done.<endOfText>
<human>Right, so those are the charges <endOfText>
<bot>Good, O K, let's see how we get so far, before we come to the last question.<endOfText>
<human>Ten, twenty, thirty, thirty eight.<endOfText>
<bot>Ten, twenty, thirty, thirty two.<endOfText>
<human>Ten, twenty, thirty, thirty eight.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh dear.<endOfText>
<human>Right, this is how the last question works.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm going to give you, as a table one of the features of the plan, I'm going to ask you as a group, but only one of you needs to write it, to write every single thing you can think of relating to that set feature.<endOfText>
<human>Every bit of information.<endOfText>
<bot>Then you've got a possible ten marks.<endOfText>
<human>You give me all the information.<endOfText>
<bot>If the other two teams can pick up on a piece of information they missed out, they get a mark and you lose one of your ten.<endOfText>
<human>Simple really isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Right, the three er, things we're going to look at are, you only need one per team, but I'll tell you what they are, waiver of premium, the insurability option,or index linking as it's sometimes called, and the paid up option.<endOfText>
<human>Right, who's in third place.<endOfText>
<bot>Third place, we have Middlemarch.<endOfText>
<human>Which one would you like to choose as a team?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, I'd like W O P.<endOfText>
<human>Right, so off you go, write as much as you can about W O P.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, Wall Street which one are you going to go for?<endOfText>
<human>What do you want?<endOfText>
<bot>You pay for right of allocation of units.<endOfText>
<human>Erm,insurability option, the middle one.<endOfText>
<bot>Insurability option.<endOfText>
<human>Which leaves you with<endOfText>
<bot>The paid up option.<endOfText>
<human>The paid up option, right.<endOfText>
<bot>O K, then two minutes.<endOfText>
<human>Write down everything you can think about it.<endOfText>
<bot>The paid up option.<endOfText>
<human>They're fighting over here.<endOfText>
<bot>It's alright.<endOfText>
<human>Could be crucial this, Wall Street and the Losers, they're neck and neck here you know.<endOfText>
<bot>I think we should have a point for because we're well behaved.<endOfText>
<human>I think you've got a good point there, yes, I might er,<endOfText>
<bot>it used to be, well you really are amazing,<endOfText>
<human>Are you sure there's actually ten things you can say about these?<endOfText>
<bot>There probably aren't, no.<endOfText>
<human>I've only done one.<endOfText>
<bot>For one more tip we can , it'll be a miracle.<endOfText>
<human>What have Wall Street got, Gerald?<endOfText>
<bot>They've got waiver of premium.<endOfText>
<human>No they've got insurability option.<endOfText>
<bot>Have they?<endOfText>
<human>Right, are we ready?<endOfText>
<bot>We've got more than one,or something.<endOfText>
<human>Are we ready?<endOfText>
<bot>Sorry,<endOfText>
<human>Nobody's answering.<endOfText>
<bot>yes, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Well, let's have this team for answering then.<endOfText>
<bot>I like polite teams.<endOfText>
<human>Oi, you lot.<endOfText>
<bot>Sorry, yes.<endOfText>
<human>They're not polite, deduct a point.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, what we're going to do now, then we will start with who's got what.<endOfText>
<human>O K.<endOfText>
<bot>John, are you going to, John's going to read out all the features that his team have come up with.<endOfText>
<human>If you can think of anything that he's missed out, you stand a chance of winning a bonus point and he loses one of his ten points.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>So off you go.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, right fine.<endOfText>
<human>Waiver of allocations, I E, a reduction of units.<endOfText>
<bot>O K, two, er,rep , units, what have I written?<endOfText>
<human>Sorry<endOfText>
<bot>The number of units.<endOfText>
<human>The number of units is reduced by age and sex.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, yes.<endOfText>
<human>O K.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, not available on high-risk jobs.<endOfText>
<human>Right<endOfText>
<bot>Not available on h , housewives, unless they can prove that they would have been in employment, would have been, erm, that they will have been<endOfText>
<human>Will be, good<endOfText>
<bot>They would have been in employment, erm, only available up to the age of sixty, then cancelled<endOfText>
<human>Two's, Christine<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, effective due, comes into effect after twenty eight weeks of illness or disability.<endOfText>
<human>It comes into effect after twenty eight weeks of an illness or a disability, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, available on joint life, first claim.<endOfText>
<human>yes<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, on joint policies, the amount of units taken from the fund is the sum of the two lives, I E, up to seven percent.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, yes, got to.<endOfText>
<bot>H I V not permitted.<endOfText>
<human>yes<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, that's<endOfText>
<human>Not available on joint  paragraph,right, that's what we've got then.<endOfText>
<bot>It is, it is.<endOfText>
<human>That's what we've got.<endOfText>
<bot>So it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine <endOfText>
<human>Right next table, anything that they've missed out?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, if they can't have the option in the leaver, then they get the extra allocation of units.<endOfText>
<human>He likes this allocation of units.<endOfText>
<bot>Can be, yes, why not, why not, yes, a bonus.<endOfText>
<human>Anything from this table.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, the benefit is only payable up to the age of sixty.<endOfText>
<human>We had that, I said that.<endOfText>
<bot>He said that.<endOfText>
<human>Are you sure?<endOfText>
<bot>yes<endOfText>
<human>It is available to housewives.<endOfText>
<bot>He said that, you're just, he, he, he said that it's available to housewives but only if they erm, will be going back to work prior to the claim, but you must be employed prior to the claim.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I didn't hear him saying that they waive the payments from you when, I didn't know if you were meant to?<endOfText>
<bot>I didn't say, he didn't say anything about er, Abbey<endOfText>
<human>No, no<endOfText>
<bot>Waiving the premiums, no.<endOfText>
<human>So basic payments , with er, well I suppose,no, no, I won't  <endOfText>
<bot>They said, they said, they only deduct six marks because they're only payable up to sixty?<endOfText>
<human>We did<endOfText>
<bot>Did you say death or ?<endOfText>
<human>You don't remember?<endOfText>
<bot>No we didn't say that.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, you just lost two marks worth then, payable up to the end of the term or er, on death.<endOfText>
<bot>O K, well done, so we've had two bonuses, so that must give you eight marks which makes you forty one.<endOfText>
<human>So if you find lots of things to say about the others, you're still in with a chance here.<endOfText>
<bot>Right then Wall Street, what, what is er?<endOfText>
<human>Insurability option,<endOfText>
<bot>Yes<endOfText>
<human>Who's going to tell us about it?<endOfText>
<bot>So you do it after five years.<endOfText>
<human>Every five years, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Then if it's not going to be taken up on one of those five years, you have to leave that payment, you lose it.<endOfText>
<human>If you don't use it you lose it.<endOfText>
<bot>You lose it, and you've got the option to take out a new plan after the five years.<endOfText>
<human>A new plan<endOfText>
<bot>To make up, to make up life cover, life cover as required.<endOfText>
<human>To make up life cover, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, it's valid up until the age of sixty five.<endOfText>
<human>yes<endOfText>
<bot>No further medical evidence is normally required.<endOfText>
<human>yes<endOfText>
<bot>And also you have the option to increase on special events I E, divorce, adoption, marriage, or on mortgages.<endOfText>
<human>Right, O K.<endOfText>
<bot>Good.<endOfText>
<human>I couldn't think of any more.<endOfText>
<bot>Anything?<endOfText>
<human>Well they haven't actually said what it is.<endOfText>
<bot>tell me then? alo<endOfText>
<human>Actually you have missed out one very crucial point.<endOfText>
<bot>The opportunity to increase  <endOfText>
<human>No he did say you could increase the sum assured <endOfText>
<bot>He did say that.<endOfText>
<human>H I V people can't have it.<endOfText>
<bot>H I V people can't have it.<endOfText>
<human>Anyone?<endOfText>
<bot>And your premiums in line with erm, increase in inflation,<endOfText>
<human>Which is measured by?<endOfText>
<bot>The Retail Price Index.<endOfText>
<human>I thought he said that once.<endOfText>
<bot>Or a proportion of it <endOfText>
<human>Hm<endOfText>
<bot>You can take a proportion of it, you don't need the five percent.<endOfText>
<human>So if you take a proportion, then what happens?<endOfText>
<bot>You have to have the same proportion next time.<endOfText>
<human>Right, if you, he said if you don't take it you lose it, which is absolutely right.<endOfText>
<bot>But if you take a proportion of it, you're only offered that proportion again.<endOfText>
<human>I think that's it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, there's something about additional insurability.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, you actually answered about additional insurability, I didn't ask you, it sounds the same, in fact it's totally different, because as you say, the option to take out more life cover on birth, marriage, and adoption,<endOfText>
<human>To a maximum of twenty five thousand<endOfText>
<bot>To a maximum of twenty five thousand, yes<endOfText>
<human>Or mortgage<endOfText>
<bot>Forget mortgages, we're talking Covermaster, yes, it's nothing to do with mortgages.<endOfText>
<human>O K.<endOfText>
<bot>So I just wanted to clear that, twenty five thousand <endOfText>
<human>Sorry,<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, or, or some percentage of it.<endOfText>
<human>yes, it's a maximum of twenty five thousand.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, or twenty five percent of the original sum assured.<endOfText>
<human>There is something in that actually charging a percent it gives you an option that you could do something which would mean that the option wasn't cancelled.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, and it was going on about  it was something to the sum insurance?<endOfText>
<human>I don't, I forget what it was now.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, well, I'm not sure, but if you find it erm, ask me, because I can't relate to it.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I think it was relevant to computers, yes, erm, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>But I'll just pick up, if the original sum assured was a hundred thousand, and you need, and you took the additional insurability option, you could obviously have twenty five thousand with is a quarter, and that's the maximum you can have anyway.<endOfText>
<human>If it was a hundred and fifty thousand you could still only have twenty five thousand.<endOfText>
<bot>But if you'd, if the original sum assured was only sixty thousand, you could only have a quarter, so you could only have fifteen thousand pounds maximum.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, O K.<endOfText>
<bot>Good, so how many bonuses.<endOfText>
<human>One, two,th , no, no, sorry, but di , who did waiver of premium?<endOfText>
<bot>You did, didn't you, so<endOfText>
<human>No, no, no, we didn't,<endOfText>
<bot>Who did waiver, you did, right, O K.<endOfText>
<human>So, one, two, three bonuses off, because you, there was one from before.<endOfText>
<bot>So that gives you seven, which brings you up to thirty nine, forty six, taking into account that one.<endOfText>
<human>One, knock these off, otherwise I shall confuse them.<endOfText>
<bot>Forty six.<endOfText>
<human>Right, waiver of premium.<endOfText>
<bot>No<endOfText>
<human>We've done that<endOfText>
<bot>We've done that.<endOfText>
<human>No we're not, paid up option.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you very much.<endOfText>
<human>Sorry about that.<endOfText>
<bot>Paid up option, for the Losers.<endOfText>
<human>O K, erm, premiums are stopped for er, if you can't afford to carry on paying them, the premiums are stopped, and your fund is continued up until the p , the point where the charges exhaust the funds, providing it's over a thousand pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>If it's under a thousand pounds, you can't get the money back through funding, and the policy is void.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, if it's paid up you can start paying again at some point in the future, but you have to pay an extra one-off charge, to do it, I think.<endOfText>
<human>At some point in the future?<endOfText>
<bot>Up until the funds are exhausted.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, before the funds are ex , exhausted.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, yes, that's right, that's absolutely correct,<endOfText>
<human>Erm, you can't choose to make it paid up, it has to be paid up because the premiums aren't being paid.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, good, O K.<endOfText>
<human>So, you've got a client who for whatever reason, is, is unable to er, afford the premiums, and providing they've got a thousand pounds in the fund, they can elect to the, the plan made paid up, whereby the life cover is sustained by the fund and all the other charges, and it's sustained until the fund runs dry.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes<endOfText>
<human>Anybody anything to add to that?<endOfText>
<bot>I think, the only thing I could add is that you've got twelve months in which to restart the payments.<endOfText>
<human>It's a twelve month period.<endOfText>
<bot>I didn't know that.<endOfText>
<human>O K, erm, and you do have to actually pay back the premiums other people would stop and start them at random.<endOfText>
<bot>So if after five months you started paying it again, you've got to pay the previous four months' premiums.<endOfText>
<human>O K, so,<endOfText>
<bot>How many's that?<endOfText>
<human>Eight.<endOfText>
<bot>No, no, we haven't <endOfText>
<human>Nobody else got any more points.<endOfText>
<bot>What do you, what do reckon, do you think they've got a good case for their ten points?<endOfText>
<human>Five, five.<endOfText>
<bot>It wasn't explained properly.<endOfText>
<human>Five, it wasn't explained properly.<endOfText>
<bot>We can find lots of reasons for not giving them ten points, couldn't we really, if we really worked at it.<endOfText>
<human>You didn't say we couldn't, we didn't say the level of cover,<endOfText>
<bot>I mean they've been a rabble all afternoon anyway, haven't they?<endOfText>
<human>Yes?<endOfText>
<bot>They've said things that weren't true to say, couldn't they, I mean, they thought it too simple to even say.<endOfText>
<human>Absolutely, just to make more points, they made a few things up,ex , absolutely.<endOfText>
<bot>They can still have their ten points, though.<endOfText>
<human>Hooray.<endOfText>
<bot>So, well done the Losers, at great expense, we have a prize for you.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, lovely.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, Mm, this is nice,<endOfText>
<human>The bonuses well, it might, it might actually work.<endOfText>
<bot>No it doesn't.<endOfText>
<human>I hope it doesn't change it, but they should do.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>O K, erm, hopefully we've had a bit of fun, but at the same time, we go , we went through all the technical information.<endOfText>
<bot>Er, tomorrow you will have an exam on Covermaster, it's not going to be the type of exam that's going to be, what's the minimum premium?, it's going to be more looking at potential clients, and what they're going to want from the plan.<endOfText>
<human>So you're going to be looking at things like additional insurability option, waiver of premium, index linking and paid up option.<endOfText>
<bot>Those are the features that you're going to need to know, and how they relate to your clients.<endOfText>
<human>More so, that it's a twenty pounds minimum premium, because they're going to ask you to apply some of that knowledge through the questions.<endOfText>
<bot>But I really don't think it will be a problem.<endOfText>
<human>If we could have erm, a coffee break now until ten past three, and then we'll enter the last phase on the, on the Covermaster, one of the last areas which is features to benefits.<endOfText>
<bot>Any questions for me before we finish?<endOfText>
<human>Right, quarter of an hour coffee break then please.<endOfText>
<bot>Get the notes.<endOfText>
<human>Change the name to the Winners now,<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>

<bot>Well I think Labour'll get in like.<endOfText>
<human>Do you?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I .<endOfText>
<human>Cos somebody was saying something about the la the last time they got in, it all went<endOfText>
<bot>It's er very very poor .<endOfText>
<human>You see there's been that there's been that many flung out of jobs Sharon, there's been that many people put out of jobs, there's been that many people bought their houses and been put out on the streets they've got no homes  you know .<endOfText>
<bot>It's about time like s somebody else had a go at it because  <endOfText>
<human>Aye.<endOfText>
<bot>Aha.<endOfText>
<human>Labour or Conservative <endOfText>
<bot>That's why me mum and dad voted Liberal Democrat this time, I mean they never vote for them .<endOfText>
<human>There'll be a lot like that.<endOfText>
<bot>There'll be a lot.<endOfText>
<human>And me mam says, oh just for a change to give someone else a chance.<endOfText>
<bot>you swing the whole it could just swing.<endOfText>
<human>Paddy Ashdown.<endOfText>
<bot>I like him, I was watching him on the telly the other day, I think he seemed nice.<endOfText>
<human>There's not many people like Neil Kinnock like.<endOfText>
<bot>Well I think John Major's nice.<endOfText>
<human>Did you see Spitting Image  ?<endOfText>
<bot>Aye  Ee  <endOfText>
<human>Ee it was great.<endOfText>
<bot>Why was he grey?<endOfText>
<human>Me and me mam couldn't understand it  <endOfText>
<bot>Yes You c he's grey because it's all to do  you turn grey.<endOfText>
<human>That's what he was grey for.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>Because he's grey because he knows he's losing, he's gonna lose his job.<endOfText>
<bot>Well they have published that he's gonna lose <endOfText>
<human>Aye.<endOfText>
<bot>his job, they mightn't.<endOfText>
<human>Ah.<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>Might come up trumps.  on the night but nobody  do on.<endOfText>
<bot>It's the politics didn't work  gotta mention politics, it's just to get away from politics.<endOfText>
<human>Who was this?<endOfText>
<bot>put a do on tonight.<endOfText>
<human>We were laughing at the Sun this morning, had a picture of Neil Kinnock's head in the light bulb and it said, could the last person out of Britain please turn the light off after them.<endOfText>
<bot>You see and another thing what they're saying is thirty year ago when Labour was in, there were strikes and everything  <endOfText>
<human>Aye   was saying that.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean grave grave diggers went on strike, hospitals went on strike, couldn't bury your dead.<endOfText>
<human>Stuff wasted in the streets, rubbish and all that and there was rats and everything.<endOfText>
<bot>Er you know but you see, conservative won the election  and because what they did was, if you went on strike they they paid you off, you got sacked and you just didn't get any money .<endOfText>
<human>And so people had no other option but to go out to work.<endOfText>
<bot>Even if you had any grievance against your employee, it didn't stand.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>And and employers put an end to people.<endOfText>
<human>They took an end because they took them in a scheme where the kids actually  got jobs  what you've done.<endOfText>
<bot>Now then that  after about six weeks or eight weeks, if you've got a kid  you can have them .<endOfText>
<human>Oh aye I don't believe in the Y T Ss and that like .<endOfText>
<bot>job.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>So that's doing away with a person's er wage isn't it.<endOfText>
<human>I think there's a few times I was gonna pack in cos I used to do the same amount of work as everyone else and I got paid <endOfText>
<bot>That's right and you were only getting aha <endOfText>
<human>not even half what they were getting  <endOfText>
<bot>And the government pays them that.<endOfText>
<human>So they really were getting you for nothing.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh aye.<endOfText>
<human>So they've made cheap labour.<endOfText>
<bot>They've made er  and you know what they did, they've privatized all the jobs.<endOfText>
<human>They school cleaners and hospital cleaners <endOfText>
<bot>Then they brought this poll tax didn't they?<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>The poll tax has done them through.<endOfText>
<human>I was gonna say, if they lose it's I think a lot of it'll be through the poll tax.<endOfText>
<bot>Aha.<endOfText>
<human>Poll tax and people getting flung out of houses.<endOfText>
<bot>That's not him is it?<endOfText>
<human>I think she's got a new husband now.<endOfText>
<bot>Not him.<endOfText>
<human>That's that little fella.<endOfText>
<bot>Aye I think he's her new husband.<endOfText>
<human>I thought that was the mate who was going out with the blonde you know.<endOfText>

<human>.<endOfText>
<bot>He went to the doctor's he says, listen if you drink another drink you'll be dead in six month.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>Full stop, there's forty milligrams of  valium.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>You've gotta take that a day.<endOfText>
<human>They reckon the doctor should've says to him He shouldn't have said that, full stop, you should never say that to an alcoholic.<endOfText>
<bot>They reckon he should've said cut it down to about two or three, four pints a day, there's fifteen milligrams of valium.<endOfText>
<human>Fifteen so you're talking treble.<endOfText>
<bot>He was taking treble the amount of valium  and drinking and all .<endOfText>
<human>What did he do John?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh he was great tonight he was back to his normal self tonight.<endOfText>
<human>Aye I saw him down the pub .<endOfText>
<bot>He's had about three pints but that's what they've told him to take.<endOfText>
<human>The psychiatrist has told him to take three pints of lager.<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>Jeff went to the psychiatrist and they start babbling on saying about the forty milligrams of valium he's taking.<endOfText>
<bot>They says the doctor's given you that to take you off the alcohol.<endOfText>
<human>They says, right, he says, I've got a I've got a problem with alcohol and he's given us the valium to get us off the alcohol.<endOfText>
<bot>He says, right six months time I'm totally off the alcohol, he says, what's gonna get us off the valium?<endOfText>
<human>Cos that that does you up <endOfText>
<bot>Ah.<endOfText>
<human>that stuff.<endOfText>
<bot>How many people get addicted to that?<endOfText>
<human>Oh aye.<endOfText>
<bot>He says, right I'm gonna go off the alcohol, I'll be totally teetotal but I'll be taking valium, he says it's just like a vicious circle, what am I gonna do after the valium.<endOfText>
<human>What you gonna give us to take us off that?<endOfText>
<bot>And they told him they told him he shouldn't even be on that.<endOfText>
<human>So what have they given him?<endOfText>
<bot>The doctor didn't even say six month.<endOfText>
<human>He sh he did but he didn't.<endOfText>
<bot>His mam's been on the phone .<endOfText>
<human>Where to?<endOfText>
<bot>The doctor.<endOfText>
<human>The doctor's?<endOfText>
<bot>Aye the doctor.<endOfText>
<human>And the doctor hadn't said six months?<endOfText>
<bot>He did.<endOfText>
<human>He did he said that which he shouldn't have done.<endOfText>
<bot>He says if you have another drink if you keep on drinking, you'll be dead in six month.<endOfText>
<human>Oh.<endOfText>
<bot>And is he saying he didn't say that ?<endOfText>
<human>That was to scare him.<endOfText>
<bot>He says if he doesn't stop drinking he'll be dead in five year.<endOfText>
<human>So I said that so he would stop thinking.<endOfText>
<bot>Aha.<endOfText>
<human>But you don't do that.<endOfText>
<bot>No with a proper alcoholic.<endOfText>
<human>He's sound as a pound isn't he like, he's only had a couple of pints.<endOfText>
<bot>first time you've been able to talk to him properly.<endOfText>
<human>So is he still on valium?<endOfText>
<bot>Aye but he's on next to nowt compared to what he was.<endOfText>
<human>What's he drinking, lager?<endOfText>
<bot>Owt.<endOfText>
<human>Doesn't make any difference just so long as it's equivalent to two pints of lager.<endOfText>
<bot>has he admitted he's an alcoholic  John?<endOfText>
<human>Aye.<endOfText>
<bot>Is he.<endOfText>
<human>I think it's between two and four pints of lager he's allowed to have a night as long as he doesn't touch spirits.<endOfText>
<bot>Aye.<endOfText>
<human>But me and Jimmy was standing  say like me and Jimmy have what seven or eight pints, a night.<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>When I go out, aye, seven or eight pints.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>Jeff can only have three or four.<endOfText>
<bot>So we says to him, why didn't he get a half of lager a h a bottle of Kaliber which is a half of lager non-alcohol, and put it in a pint glass.<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>So he can have like four pints but it'll be exactly the same as us having eight.<endOfText>
<human>Aye.<endOfText>
<bot>Know what I mean.<endOfText>
<human>.<endOfText>

<human>Right you know they're at export price list?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, er Steven er Steve  their er designer<endOfText>
<bot>These were the people I wrote to the other day ?<endOfText>
<human>That's right, Roy  and Jerry .<endOfText>
<bot>Steve works in the engineering office and has taken over some of the er you know purchasing function as well, like enquiries and stuff.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>He's just been on to Maureen, got a couple of orders  bearings and an Anglia contact.<endOfText>
<human>I explained to him about what we've done up to date and the fact that we've yet to sort the account out properly.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Er and what he's saying is, well can I have a price for these items?<endOfText>
<bot>So I said, well I I explained, now look, you were on an export price list now, one of the things Jerry didn't like  <endOfText>
<human>but we've got to look at is more comparable with U K.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Erm so what I've done is said, Are these for use in U K or export? and these are for use in the U K. Right so I've said well we'll probably give you a price relating to that then.<endOfText>
<bot>ball bearings and and what was the other one?<endOfText>
<human>And an Anglia contact bearing as well.<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Right er <endOfText>
<human>Now you know, to be to be honest I was talking about it, I couldn't tell you what the  average percent  is from last year.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Er in fa I don't know<endOfText>
<bot>Could I  I could from those statistics couldn't I tho Or or haven't we sold anything to  this year?<endOfText>
<human>Erm I'm not sure whether we have or not.<endOfText>
<bot>Won't it be on this lot?<endOfText>
<human>Er I'm not sure actually whether they would appear on them or not, I haven't seen the new statistics so I don't know.<endOfText>
<bot>Wh who no no no these are old statistics, these are your<endOfText>
<human>Mine?<endOfText>
<bot>No they won't be on because they're export.<endOfText>
<human>No they're not on January's.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh because they count as export?<endOfText>
<human>That's right.<endOfText>
<bot>Although they're at home.<endOfText>
<human>Ye they've only just been put onto a home account.<endOfText>
<bot>You think you've got problems.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>So now I can't tell you but I <endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>know I know it'll be say thirtyish percent.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah as <endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>opposed to the forty in the U K so we've got to get it up a bit.<endOfText>
<human>Erm but I've just thought, you know, get this away, let him get you know, buy them, go in at say forty percent as an O E margin<endOfText>
<bot>What would I mean if it wasn't , if it was if it was erm think of another U K customer .<endOfText>
<human>A similar sized U K customer<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Well <endOfText>
<bot>We'd be looking at making forty percent margin.<endOfText>
<human>Between thirty five, forty percent margin.<endOfText>
<bot>Well you better price them accordingly.<endOfText>
<human>Right okay.<endOfText>
<bot>It's just that and then we have got to get this sorted out long <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>term obviously.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So  <endOfText>
<human>Well i apart from anything else, it's stating our position<endOfText>
<bot>Sure.<endOfText>
<human>isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Now where erm  Yeah I mean does that <endOfText>
<bot>You see .<endOfText>
<human>does that compare them with the  customers?<endOfText>
<bot>U K customers ?<endOfText>
<human>I haven't even looked at  yet.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh on those, no we charge them a lot more.<endOfText>
<human>The  ones we c we manage to sell at about fifty, fifty five percent margin.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Because although that's <endOfText>
<bot>three o'clock.<endOfText>
<human>It's not three o'clock is it?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh it is.<endOfText>
<human>It's three o'clock.<endOfText>
<bot>It's two minutes to.<endOfText>
<human>Right okay.<endOfText>
<bot><endOfText>
<human>Tape number three in conversation with Mr John .<endOfText>
<bot>You were mentioning the the old coffin route from .<endOfText>
<human>Starting at , you said.<endOfText>
<bot>Starting at a hundred and ninety.<endOfText>
<human>On the one inch, map.<endOfText>
<bot>Hundred and ninety.<endOfText>
<human>Up by that loch.<endOfText>
<bot>Now that's near  Loch .<endOfText>
<human>That's it.<endOfText>
<bot>Watch me now.<endOfText>
<human>Ah can you mark it in maybe?<endOfText>
<bot>That's it.<endOfText>
<human>I see, up to the Glen .<endOfText>
<bot>That's right, but it doesn't go as far as the Glen ,<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>it keeps this side of the Glen ,<endOfText>
<human>To the  side.<endOfText>
<bot>And then in like that.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>Follow me?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll just have a shot at pencilling that in.<endOfText>
<human>Yes it's a very<endOfText>
<bot>Its near it anyway.<endOfText>
<human>a windy track.<endOfText>
<bot>It's a, oh yes a windy track.<endOfText>
<human>Not the easiest ways.<endOfText>
<bot>The people who undertook such a <endOfText>
<human>It's more or less the hard ground.<endOfText>
<bot>Aha, the ground very much ?<endOfText>
<human>And there was and there was cairns where they used to rest the the coffin, cairns here and there along the route.<endOfText>
<bot>Was there?<endOfText>
<human>Where they used to rest the the coffin for a m m and have a dram and a piece of cheese or some biscuits.<endOfText>
<bot>I'd read about, I read erm read in erm some paper or other not so very long ago, about erm a funeral  and the  that was going along the road of course,and they came to a to a erm hotel and they were och, they were going for miles and miles and miles and they went into this hotel and the they party the funeral party went into the hotel and had a good few drinks and they were well away when they came out and they they they went away without the coffin, for two miles, two miles before they discovered that they didn't have the coffin.<endOfText>
<human>They had to go back ag go back again for the coffin.<endOfText>
<bot>The people who undertook er following that route, through such a an entanglement of lochans and turns, would have had to have know their directions very well otherwise <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>they could have been lost quite easily.<endOfText>
<human>And do you know think that these cairns possibly were there to guide them as mu as much as anything?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh well they they knew the road, these men knew knew the road very well, and er they knew the<endOfText>
<human>Area.<endOfText>
<bot>area, they could tell by the hills, they could tell the way.<endOfText>
<human>I came from m my from , across the hill with my father when I was sixteen, at night.<endOfText>
<bot>At night?<endOfText>
<human>At night.<endOfText>
<bot>But it was a lovely moonlit night and we didn't leave , it was about eight o'clock at night when we left .<endOfText>
<human>We were at at  there, and I went with er with my father er on a Friday and we came back that night.<endOfText>
<bot>Now that must be a good, what would you say, seven miles at least in one direction?<endOfText>
<human>Well it it would be something like that,so something like <endOfText>
<bot>At least.<endOfText>
<human>seven miles.<endOfText>
<bot>Easily.<endOfText>
<human>And  Well it would, it was two good hours, to walk across the erm  .<endOfText>
<bot>Take you two hours anyway.<endOfText>
<human>That was  well it's wasn't quite a mile and a quarter.<endOfText>
<bot>And this was just a beaten track?<endOfText>
<human>Oh just a beaten track.<endOfText>
<bot>Whereas the other one in Glen  was an actual made track?<endOfText>
<human>Well I'll tell you a good story about that, to s , to let you see that it was a well beaten track.<endOfText>
<bot>And it was just  the the the people were often walking along this track, anyway there was a man,there was erm,was a, there was  a man and a woman walked over to  and walked back again at night, well in the the even , evening anyway.<endOfText>
<human>And the woman lost her brooch on the way back and she saw this man next morning, he was a policeman in , and he he was too fond of the drink,a and he he was on, he was a railway policeman, and he fell onto the rails, when the train was coming, nobody knows how he how he how he er he lost one arm er about there and the other one about there, both arms but he he survived it.<endOfText>
<bot>Nobody knows how he he how the  how his head wasn't bashed.<endOfText>
<human>But anyway  this woman that lost the brooch, she me she saw this man, without the hands going across the hill to , she asked him where he was going, and he said, I'm going to to , across the hill.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you coming?<endOfText>
<human>No, she said, I've been there yesterday, but er I lost a brooch, and I wish you would be on the look out for it.<endOfText>
<bot>Did you keep the track all the way? he said.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, all the way.<endOfText>
<bot>Anyway this man without the arms, he went to  and he had er he had er a pocket outside his jacket here, and he he erm got the brooch  and he  called on the at the house where this woman was and he says, Put your hand into that pocket, he said, and she puts her hand in, Oh, she say, she says, You've got the brooch.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, yeah, he says, I think that'll be yours.<endOfText>
<bot>But how did  the, what was puzzling a lot of people how did he manage to get it off the ground and into his pocket.<endOfText>
<human>By his teeth?<endOfText>
<bot>He must he must erm stooped down on his knees and caught it in his mouth and and got it into his pocket some way or another.<endOfText>
<human>Mm, but both these people  came from ?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, both of them.<endOfText>
<human>And that's a, an incredible tale.<endOfText>
<bot>It is, right enough .<endOfText>
<human>Because it  it really bears out what you were saying that the  there was a track which<endOfText>
<bot>Well it it erm, it shows you that there was a track.<endOfText>
<human>Because no one could have found that brooch if it had just been a wilderness.<endOfText>
<bot>No, no, no, no.<endOfText>
<human>If you had been any any where else on the hill you'd have, wouldn't have a chance cos you couldn't, you couldn't follow the track  that they they di they followed the day before.<endOfText>
<bot>And that was the lady's son involved who told you this?<endOfText>
<human>That's right.<endOfText>
<bot>Roughly when do you think it happened, that incident with the brooch?<endOfText>
<human>Pardon?<endOfText>
<bot>When in time did it occur?<endOfText>
<human>That's right.<endOfText>
<bot>Aha, can you put a date on it though?<endOfText>
<human>Was it the, before the Great War, during the<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes I think so.<endOfText>
<human>Think <endOfText>
<bot>before the<endOfText>
<human>I think it as before the War but I'm not quite sure mind either, could have been after the War.<endOfText>
<bot>That's the first War?<endOfText>
<human>I know the lady, oh yes first War, I know the lady was going to  after the War, the man could have been.<endOfText>
<bot>Very <endOfText>
<human>possible.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you have any reminiscences of  the the Great War and the way it affected , were many of the men called up to to serve from the area?<endOfText>
<human>Well all the young they were, they were either called up or they vol volunteered.<endOfText>
<bot>And did you see vessels in the area, because you yourself would be too young were you not?<endOfText>
<human>N well I was I was erm  I would have been called up  in another two months after the War was over, if the War had continued  I would have been eighteen in in that in the following January.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you recall seeing any ships that were involved in  the War coming by,?<endOfText>
<human>Well the the some of the soldiers and sailors used to walk from  all the way home to  or  or .<endOfText>
<bot>The snow was that heavy that no traffic, nothing could move.<endOfText>
<human>They were walking<endOfText>
<bot>Er about <endOfText>
<human>all that distance .<endOfText>
<bot>And there weren't really proper roads?<endOfText>
<human>The road<endOfText>
<bot>the roads were there alright but they were<endOfText>
<human>Snowed.<endOfText>
<bot>covered over with sn with a few feet of snow.<endOfText>
<human>There was no snow ploughs in those days, it was all hand cut if they were cutting drifts it was manual labour.<endOfText>
<bot>Spade?<endOfText>
<human>Spade.<endOfText>
<bot>Were you badly affect in the, by winters?<endOfText>
<human>Well we had we had a lot of snow in those days, far more than than there's been since then.<endOfText>
<bot>The seasons seem to have changed.<endOfText>
<human>Now, how did these people you mentioned before make this track at , it was a better made track, you said it wasn't just a beaten<endOfText>
<bot>Well from inside the inside the forest fence<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>it's there it started and the rest of it was all a beaten track like what was going to .<endOfText>
<human>If, so from the the  with Loch  down towards  it was a beaten track?<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>But from the  towards  it was a proper track?<endOfText>
<bot>That's right, proper track.<endOfText>
<human>Now how did they in those days make  the the track?<endOfText>
<bot>Well there'd be be a squad of men working there, paid by the estate.<endOfText>
<human>And use any materials that were found near by .<endOfText>
<bot>And they they wouldn't be getting the money they're getting today.<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>If they they they would, if there was a gaffer there he would be getting a shilling a day and the labourers would be getting ninepence or something,n ninepence a day.<endOfText>
<human>and it would be hard work too.<endOfText>
<bot>Perhaps perhaps a pound or two of .<endOfText>
<human>These were the conditions then.<endOfText>
<bot>That's how they had so much money, all these landlords in those days.<endOfText>
<human>There were no taxing.<endOfText>
<bot>And any servants they had were low low were very lowly paid.<endOfText>
<human>I'll tell you a story about erm  erm  a girl from , she was on service in  with erm   Sir John , Sir John and Lady .<endOfText>
<bot>There was a lodge there in  in the in the village.<endOfText>
<human>And this day Lady  had some letters to post in the early morning, she wanted them away, on the mails in the early morning.<endOfText>
<bot>And she told this maid to go with the letters to post them.<endOfText>
<human>And it was going, but she doing something and she the Lady  seen her going through a corridor and she said to her, Run Annie run.<endOfText>
<bot>No my lady I never run for d anybody and I'm not going to run for you.<endOfText>
<human>She was a good maid though.<endOfText>
<bot>and she didn't get the sack.<endOfText>

<human>I used to go  because hopefully one of the hardest town in<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Derby, but I mean one of the  any aggro, the stall  any hassle is in Covent Garden, which is a tourist place that was between two .<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>In a pub cos couldn't handle the old English beer and all that, and they start an argument between themselves.<endOfText>
<bot>Tell you wha whe where is a rough place just recently is er Farnborough.<endOfText>

<bot>Farnborough.<endOfText>
<human>It's always been rough place<endOfText>
<bot>Did it?.<endOfText>
<human>Been there for a start so it must be a rough place .<endOfText>
<bot>The amount of times people have been thrown from the top of your window at night sort of thing.<endOfText>
<human>been wrapped round people's head at tumble down  and stuff.<endOfText>
<bot>a rough place as well..<endOfText>
<human>That's why were  .<endOfText>
<bot>Like the, the place that's really , really<endOfText>
<human>It's the video they get in it, it's the American influence in it?.<endOfText>
<bot>No it ain't.<endOfText>
<human>It is, it's within our self in it?<endOfText>
<bot>I don't believe that shit about you watch a video then all of a sudden you're a Rambo.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but your mind's on  yeah, and what do they do, yeah and then they re-enact it outside.<endOfText>
<bot>No, it's a load of shit, they can't, I can't believe you've got to have the mentality of a five year old and you fucking  if you, if you believe it  <endOfText>
<human>Well that's right  .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah but not everybody<endOfText>
<human>But  wants you out Trev, he might burst a .<endOfText>
<bot>I .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, it's true, you take bits of The Sweeney, yeah, they done an episode of where there's bank raid and what they don't want they use mask, masking tape right  like that and end up .<endOfText>
<bot>Got to try and come up with the rest of them  that's how they done it , a couple of days after somebody re-enact that  again.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but the thing is right, they, that's because they're criminally insane any way, it may have given them an idea but it doesn't mean that that women or whoever it might not of died any way.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't see why, why the, the many should suffer because of the few idiots.<endOfText>
<human>Trouble is they lie  .<endOfText>
<bot>you lie  .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but even so, the  well it, you're  I wouldn't see a film .<endOfText>
<bot>Do you think , you see you've got to get another bloke  and bloody great, he'll do the same thing.<endOfText>

<bot>Do  .<endOfText>
<human>When we .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Well I mean I've known this bloke, if somebody's gonna do something like that whether they see it on a film or not, I  still go out and do it, they make it  .<endOfText>
<bot>look, look  .<endOfText>
<human>I've  .<endOfText>
<bot>Once upon a time there .<endOfText>

<bot>Little one <endOfText>
<human>.<endOfText>
<bot>You know, the only way, the only way you can stop them is to  .<endOfText>
<human>All I know is that any, any sight , any sight person who watches television doesn't forcibly go out and re-enact it.<endOfText>
<bot>I, I .<endOfText>
<human>Well, I don't think so.<endOfText>
<bot>I was gonna say, if, if, if he, if he's not reasonably sane then he might be, he's gonna do, go out and do something like that any way<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>he makes a plan a diff a different way sort of thing .<endOfText>
<human>The, the idea have been planted there any way.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah  all the film bloke's have  way of doing it, which he, he probably would of found out any way.<endOfText>

<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, right, we  row, we lucky we've got a row of trees all the way  along the back fence like, and in the summer when all the foliage  makes quite a nice barrier for the noise and sound and stuff, but what were trying to do is to stop them from, were trying to make them spread out<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>the right way to do that is crop them, don't ya?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So there's me and a mate up a ladder with chain saws and that nearly all day yesterday, good fun actually.<endOfText>
<human>Give me a fucking chain saw in me hand I'm well away , love it.<endOfText>
<bot>They're not, they're not big trees or nothing so I mean there was, it was only a, like one of these small  power chain saws,one hand sort of thing, grab hold of it like that, there was nothing, no really big branches, were only cutting the tops off.<endOfText>
<human>We, we did trim them a bit around the sides, they were quite big, you know,.<endOfText>
<bot>What are they  trees or something?.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, I don't know really, Oak, Sycamore a mixture.<endOfText>
<bot>trees.<endOfText>
<human>.got a couple of Oak tree's, there in the corner you've got, cos our fence you've got that, my house is there right,road down like that and you've got a fencing, it goes like that and with got trees all around it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And they're and they're, we've got Oak, big Oak trees that have started to get quite big now as they will and the rest is all a mixture of Horse, Horse Chestnut and Sycamore and couple of other like things in there.<endOfText>
<bot>A couple of times we had  big branch and stuff .<endOfText>
<human>You know good fun, love, love having a hand and chain saw.<endOfText>
<bot>We, we hired one of these little ones, we did get a bigger for the , only cost us fifteen quid to hire three chain saws for the day.<endOfText>
<human>Where was that?<endOfText>
<bot>That was the, erm, the tool hire shop in, in North Camp.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>it's alright.<endOfText>

<human>Yes, it's wicked, wicked man.<endOfText>
<bot>Might go .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Not got a hang over or nothing.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Still .<endOfText>
<human>I've been as fucking sober as a Judge since Friday night.<endOfText>
<bot>Put me off I think.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I only go out drinking now once a week so I think I make the most of it, can't remember anything I did Friday night again.<endOfText>
<bot>typical night out.<endOfText>
<human>No I don't know whether it's true or not I don't know whether they're fucking  trouble is it sounds like the sort of thing I do, is we parked in the multi storey car park in Guildon .<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>Parked in the multi storey car park in Guildon and were walking along and like there's all this, you go down to the ground floor and then you've got the first and second  and er  you can get to the first floor where it's like the first floor  the first floor is just above sort of street level<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>but, with, with this walk down into this, this dip so I had to get underneath and I said where'd you park? and he said the second floor taking the piss, so apparently three of his other mates who were well dressed up as well, and he, he said race ya, so I started off fucking, so he, he started off running through the thing right, cos  said race yeah, he went, apparently I just climbed up the outside of the building   climbed up two fucking flights of floors, you know, I can't remember anything about it though.<endOfText>
<bot>You see I can't remember if they're if they're pulling my plonker or not, but that is the sort of thing I do, but I can't remember anything about it.<endOfText>
<human>The only trouble is I did have quite, well it's easy though that's the thing  it's just like a, it's just a multi storey car park, so it's quite easy, and you, you know you can get strong when you're pissed don't you, like<endOfText>
<bot>What  fucking  .<endOfText>
<human>Well either you have to think it's wrong.<endOfText>
<bot>yeah but I mean, I  it, I  when I'm fucking pissed, I can't  sober, that's why I probably think they're, they're not pulling a plonker cos I've done that sort of thing in the past  had me fucking climbing on bikes, swinging off the side of the building .<endOfText>
<human>Oh I.<endOfText>
<bot>See I never know whether they're pulling, pulling a plonker or not you know, that's the real , like I said I can't remember doing it, but, I wouldn't put it pass myself and I fucking get stupid, I don't get aggressive or anything I just get stupid, you know, I do shit like that.<endOfText>
<human>I've nicked bus stop signs, fucking road signs and stuff, I just get stupid, that's if I get that pissed, I mean I probably talking of, talking of fucking all most not knowing you're right name sort of pissed.<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>That's the thing,apparent apparently I couldn't even walk straight, and yet there's me fucking climbing up the outside of a building, which to me sounds about right.<endOfText>
<bot>God knows how I didn't kill myself and the sheer of the whole thing was, it wasn't even on the second floor, it was on the ground floor, they were just pulling a .<endOfText>
<human>Cos I count.<endOfText>
<bot>I, I use to go up the .<endOfText>
<human>But norm nine times out of ten you went the inside of it.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah, just sat there in the outside, down a .<endOfText>
<human>Well I, see, if, my memory<endOfText>
<bot>Fucking people use to come out and fucking say to me, fucking wanker up there, I wonder if he's gonna jump,the old bill .<endOfText>
<human>Well, my, my memory right, you go down into, into like a, the ground floor and the top of the, like the bottom of the next floor is about that sort of height, but there is a wall up there sort of thing, which erm, I, I must, which you could probably get on.<endOfText>
<bot>So what they says is that I, I got on at this wall, jumped across onto this other wall, shinned up the outside of this other wall, stood on top of this the first floor wall and jumped up and caught hold of the top of the second floor wall and he reckon in the la about fucking twenty odd seconds, I was up and over and in, they, they, they  fucking kill yourself, get down, I can't remember none of it.<endOfText>
<human>The on the only thing I can remember is running after the car.<endOfText>
<bot>Why they all just piled in did they?<endOfText>
<human>Well I don't know.<endOfText>
<bot>to fuck off?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, probably, me and this other mate he'd a, did a, I can, I can remember him saying something about I'll race yeah, it, like I remember just remember him, me and him run running down ramps and stuff trying to get back down to the ground floor, so   .<endOfText>
<bot>Actually sometimes I'm pretty glad I don't remember things like that.<endOfText>
<human>You can see why I was in such a bad mood Saturday cos if I'd drunk that much Friday night you can imagine what sort of a hang over I had.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean we got up about nine o'clock as well.<endOfText>
<human>but er I'd meet up in town and  our house like twenty past nine, half past , get, get, get the bit of shopping done before the fucking  crowds I might off wasted me time, we got in there about ten o'clock,right old day.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>By fucking half past ten it's, it's well busy, it's so packed.<endOfText>
<bot>Barry's not there.<endOfText>
<human>I bet you hate it when the glue goes hard .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>That's the only thing with bonding .<endOfText>
<bot>When you're fucking pissed out does compare to lot of them  taking sister up to er Black  you know.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I could do with some .<endOfText>
<bot>The thing is the  said to me  she said, oh  were going out in style and have a drink, had a really nice sandwich there like, it was french loaf about that bit, get nice home cooked  lot's of cheese and onion right, really nice .<endOfText>
<human>Fucking dangling .<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I just go and get this and I'll go and pop down to .<endOfText>
<human>eat sort of thing.<endOfText>
<bot>We eventually got in there about coming up to half past two<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>so I mean I'd been dying for this pint all, all day sort of thing, I felt much better after that.<endOfText>
<human>Yes that right, yeah, and that was the start of this erm <endOfText>
<bot>I said I was  myself but , but what get's me is people stand there chat, I mean your walking behind them and then all of a sudden there just stop dead, and you must be carry on walking  oh god there's about twenty of them there blocking the fucking isle<endOfText>
<human>Yeah<endOfText>
<bot>and you've got to try and get round them, oh god, there's about six thousand  trying to do the same thing.<endOfText>

<human>Oh, I wasn't and erm, the next thing I know I've nearly fucking been bowled over, sort of the bags in  fucking look behind me , so those two  fucking bought the bags back down fucking legs  and I've just caught this like  running round another, another thing, I thought oh fucking little kid, the next thing I know there's another one  gone pass me like, taken the bags,the handles out of the plastic bags, fucking  and it was a girl that was going first this time, so I  and sure enough there was a little fucking brat boy coming again, so I just went  flying he sort of looked up at me and rubbed his eye like that and  carried on running after the .<endOfText>

<bot>put the handbags of the  and as he came round I sort of went .<endOfText>
<human>And you know the only reason you've got a hang over and you know there isn't really any body else to blame but yourself, but that makes you want to look for a scape-goat, but the kid .<endOfText>
<bot>There's nothing worse than being in a foul temper and knowing that it's only you, you've got to blame for it.<endOfText>
<human>It's really nice and sweet all day and it's fucking making me even angrier.<endOfText>
<bot>I hate going shopping with them, she wants to go next Saturday, I said fuck that.<endOfText>

<human>Zero innit?<endOfText>
<bot>That's my father's name?car.<endOfText>
<human>No, what colour's your car.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>Silver.<endOfText>
<bot>Silver, silver ah .<endOfText>
<human>Mein  mein motor ist er rot <endOfText>
<bot>Red?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah  mine's red.<endOfText>
<bot>Habens sie rot motor <endOfText>
<human>You're on drugs.<endOfText>
<bot>Nein.<endOfText>
<human>Mick got that one right.<endOfText>
<bot>Anyway  <endOfText>
<human>I'm not I'm I'm sort of like beginners course .<endOfText>
<bot>Ugh <endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah well.<endOfText>
<bot>and I was gonna  French.<endOfText>
<human>Eh?<endOfText>
<bot>I'll go and do a French C S E and er they basically  if you get sort of like a B or a C that's enough to get you by  <endOfText>
<human>Parlez-vous francais eh?<endOfText>
<bot>Eh?<endOfText>
<human>Parlez-vous francais?<endOfText>
<bot>Ah oui.<endOfText>
<human>Er <endOfText>
<bot>Un petit.<endOfText>
<human>Un petit pois.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm  oh shit.<endOfText>
<human>Merde.<endOfText>
<bot>That's who this is for actually it's Longman's.<endOfText>
<human>They're the  the people who do the the tapes and stuff for French and German and stuff like that .<endOfText>
<bot>But it's it's also going to the Oxford English Dictionary, cos what they want<endOfText>
<human>do you know it's gone.<endOfText>
<bot>I can't spea cos I've been learning German I can't remember it.<endOfText>
<human>It's all for the Oxford English Dictionary.<endOfText>
<bot>What they want is everyday talk.<endOfText>
<human>Really?<endOfText>
<bot>Straight up.<endOfText>
<human>So they're gonna listen to Rumbold speak and think oh my god.<endOfText>
<bot>What's this for anyway?<endOfText>
<human>Oxford English Dictionary.<endOfText>
<bot>So, so I said they're, they're<endOfText>
<human>They're trying to make a  dictionary up for everyday language, that everybody uses.<endOfText>
<bot>So rather than <endOfText>
<human>You're getting paid for this are you?<endOfText>
<bot>Twenty five quid.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah?<endOfText>
<bot>Gift voucher.<endOfText>
<human>They're, they're, they're put well, they're supposed to be putting swear words in it, stuff like that you know so  They they just want ordinary common or garden speech cos basically  to help sort of like English students actually coming to this country you know?<endOfText>
<bot>They hear sort of rhyming slang and things like this and they think my god what's he on about.<endOfText>
<human>And I suppose  their slang version to  gonna help out other people.<endOfText>
<bot>What do they do?<endOfText>
<human>Er  don't know actually <endOfText>
<bot>I mean he's told me all about this stuff .<endOfText>
<human>It's a lightweight.<endOfText>
<bot>Bog off you.<endOfText>
<human>I'm gonna hit you <endOfText>
<bot>What I wanna know  what was all this fucking hassle in aid of?<endOfText>
<human>What hassle?<endOfText>
<bot>Just minding me own business and I get fucking  things thrown at me, timesheet ripped  timecard  cut .<endOfText>
<human>Shame about that  .<endOfText>
<bot>Fuck off.<endOfText>
<human>Timecard cut, I dunno.<endOfText>
<bot>It's just not good enough.<endOfText>
<human>No, they could have cut it a bit more couldn't they?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean really.<endOfText>
<human>try and get out on time  me old boy.<endOfText>
<bot>Eh?<endOfText>
<human>No, I was talking about him.<endOfText>
<bot>He was first out last time near enough.<endOfText>
<human>like anything weren't we old boy?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah!<endOfText>
<bot>I'm really  stitching me  timesheet.<endOfText>
<human>. I'm having me fucking stuff vandalized.<endOfText>
<bot>Did you see that ?<endOfText>
<human>My person was attacked.<endOfText>
<bot>Not to mention me timesheet.<endOfText>
<human>Just what the fucking do you think you're doing?<endOfText>
<bot>Is that any of your business?<endOfText>
<human>Think it is as you're using my tools.<endOfText>
<bot>Don't even know if I'm gonna be able to clock out this aft this evening.<endOfText>
<human>Oh that's gonna, that's gonna kill the cherub.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos he wants a lift off you I mean what's he gonna do?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah old boy!<endOfText>
<bot>Cherub, you should have thought of this mate.<endOfText>
<human>What's, what happens if he can't clock out tonight?<endOfText>
<bot>You're gonna be fucked for a lift ain't you?<endOfText>
<human>Have to fucking walk home won't he?<endOfText>
<bot>Have to fucking walk, don't bother me.<endOfText>
<human>Just walk anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>over the bridge innit?<endOfText>
<human>Fuck off.<endOfText>
<bot>Give me a mint for that.<endOfText>
<human>Give me a mint cos I haven't.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh no, I don't believe I did that.<endOfText>
<human>I'm having a nightmare.<endOfText>
<bot>What've you done now?<endOfText>
<human>Threw away my bag of rubbish and stuff and  I had a packet of mints in it .<endOfText>
<bot>Oh <endOfText>
<human>Get it out, that'll still be <endOfText>
<bot>Ain't fucking fishing through that lot.<endOfText>
<human>Twenty one p's worth of mints.<endOfText>
<bot>Got more pride than that.<endOfText>
<human>then.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah well we know what sort of bloke you are though.<endOfText>
<human>Fucking skint.<endOfText>
<bot>That had better go in that's all I can say.<endOfText>
<human>On top of old smokey  Arseholes are cheap today  arseholes are cheap today.<endOfText>
<bot>yesterday <endOfText>
<human>I never used to  I never used to realize what people were talking about at school and stuff when they said .<endOfText>
<bot>That's hilarious innit?<endOfText>
<human>What?<endOfText>
<bot>I never used to get that  though .<endOfText>
<human>say it at school and somebody'd say that and go oh!<endOfText>
<bot>What's the difference between a prick and a cunt.<endOfText>
<human>I bet he still sat there and laughed though.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah, like you do   .<endOfText>
<human>No, you go home, you think about it and<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>you know?<endOfText>
<bot>You daren't ask anyone.<endOfText>
<human>He didn't realize what he was saying .<endOfText>
<bot>I I will always remember the poor guy who was  coming out of the showers with a hard on  <endOfText>
<human>.<endOfText>
<bot>He was queer.<endOfText>
<human>thirteen or fourteen.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh this guy wasn't.<endOfText>
<human>I've seen him since with some really nice women and he had  girls at school as well.<endOfText>
<bot>No that helped him actually,trying to find out whether he was or not.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah he  come out the shower with an amazing <endOfText>
<bot>you imagine .<endOfText>
<human>Is that  Stuart?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Get all the young kiddies  fifth year.<endOfText>
<bot>fifth year .<endOfText>
<human>in the towels and that.<endOfText>
<bot>go in the shower with them on.<endOfText>
<human>fifth years  thinking they're like  grown up and everything.<endOfText>
<bot>fourteen sort of an an average sort of time for puberty <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>round his navel.<endOfText>
<human>It's exactly the same as, we had one  <endOfText>
<bot>And he was he was a big, not, I don't mean big down but he was a big sort of stocky bloke as well.<endOfText>
<human>And he was well well mature for his age.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean he looked like an eighteen year old.<endOfText>
<human>There was one at our yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Exactly the same as ours.<endOfText>
<human>When we was about fourteen in the fourth year at school, there was this quite chubby bloke  he'd have a towel just there while you shower.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah that's right, that's what <endOfText>
<human>He'd sort of hang out, he'd  shower with his <endOfText>
<bot>you know he'd go like that, yeah look at me I'm, I'm mature sort of thing.<endOfText>
<human>That's so funny.<endOfText>
<bot>It wasn't at the time because you had a real complex about it but <endOfText>
<human>Right old bombardment I got then didn't I?<endOfText>
<bot>anyone?<endOfText>
<human>Next page old boy, next page.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, next page even.<endOfText>
<human>Bloody hell!<endOfText>
<bot>Perhaps there ain't none in there today.<endOfText>
<human>Could have sworn I saw some tits in there today.<endOfText>
<bot>I did see some tits in there, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Do you wanna go home?<endOfText>
<bot>Jam special again old boy.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah quite nice.<endOfText>
<bot>Quite nice.<endOfText>
<human>but I can't handle that pub.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank the fuck for that.<endOfText>
<human>Hi ho hi ho it's off to work we go.<endOfText>
<bot>With a bucket and spade and a hand grenade hi ho hi ho hi ho hi ho hi ho  it's off to Rumbold's we go  with a bucket and spade  hi ho hi ho .<endOfText>
<human>Hi ho  hi ho so it's off to work we go <endOfText>
<bot>Figaro  figaro figaro figaro <endOfText>
<human>Scrape the scalpel out.<endOfText>
<bot>That's right I do apologize.<endOfText>
<human>all the bollocks.<endOfText>
<bot>What for?<endOfText>
<human>You haven't done anything.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Who the fucking hell you gonna blame now Frank ain't here then?<endOfText>
<bot>Eh?<endOfText>
<human>You've got nobody left to blame have you?<endOfText>
<bot>You gonna clean my board?<endOfText>
<human>No,off.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, you nancy.<endOfText>
<human>Look, I don't wanna go home with dirty hands, alright?<endOfText>
<bot>I don't eat food with dirty hands either.<endOfText>
<human>I like fucking clean hands.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>That's why I don't ever do any work.<endOfText>
<bot>Even when you're working.<endOfText>
<human>Cos you don't do any work.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos you got clean hands.<endOfText>
<human>That's why you  I think you're well out of order.<endOfText>
<bot>What time is it?<endOfText>
<human>Four twenty.<endOfText>
<bot>And we're Leeds United  Leeds United F C .<endOfText>
<human>Yes my son?<endOfText>
<bot>And so begins another weary day  so begins another weary day.<endOfText>
<human>La la la la in the morning I awake  my arms my legs my belly aches   And so begins another weary day.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh in the morning I awake, my arms my legs my  Oh my   is full of shit  my  is full of shit  it's full of shit, shit and  .<endOfText>
<human>Oi fuck off,punch your fucking lights out.<endOfText>
<bot>cunt.<endOfText>
<human>Trev, maybe you didn't hear me.<endOfText>
<bot>I said fuck off or I'll punch your fucking lights out.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, sorry old boy..<endOfText>
<bot>Alright  ?<endOfText>
<human>Fucking well be.<endOfText>
<bot>Well,you see.<endOfText>
<human>But he's not saying that to anyone else.<endOfText>
<bot>Just have to wait and see.<endOfText>
<human>Not yet anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>are you pulling my plonker or what?<endOfText>
<human>Like we'd love to  <endOfText>
<bot>just ask Barry what  just er Mick  <endOfText>
<human>He reckons we'll be going soon.<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>I I'll go after Christmas.<endOfText>
<bot>Hello.<endOfText>
<human>Science is thought of as a subject that is difficult both to teach and to learn.<endOfText>
<bot>The folklore in school terms is that you have to be a relatively ancient teenager to appreciate physics and chemistry and biology.<endOfText>
<human>Is this true?<endOfText>
<bot>Today I have with me Dr Mike King, who's made a study of science teaching in schools.<endOfText>
<human>Mike, how early can science be taught to children?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I think that rather depends on saying fairly concisely what it is we mean by science.<endOfText>
<human>If in a sense it means how early can you teach children facts and contents and very straightforward knowledge, then I think the answer is not very early at all because it may be fairly meaningless that you could teach a child to repeat Newton's law, perhaps the same way as you could teach him to repeat the eleven times table, but without a good concept of number or what Newton meant.<endOfText>
<bot>It's probably something they could learn off parrot fashion, but doesn't have any actual meaning for them.<endOfText>
<human>But if you look at science as a way of exploring their world, a world they can structure their curiosity about aspects of the physical world, about aspects of the environment, then I think we can do it very early indeed, probably from the time children can come to school at the age of five and from reception classes onwards.<endOfText>
<bot>In fact, we do run a project which looks at the ways science can be taught in the first school, which has been very surprising to me and many of my colleagues by what can actually be done with children in the ages of five to seven.<endOfText>
<human>For most young children in that age group, the world's a magic place and we traditionally like to teach them nature study and flowers and cuddly hamsters and rabbits in school, and that's the nature table syndrome, and that's great and I'm not knocking that at all.<endOfText>
<bot>There is so much opportunity for children to look at the nature of the physical world around them which isn't taken advantage of, and which could be, and I think that may have something to do with the attitude of teachers as much as the attitude of children.<endOfText>
<human>But erm they're tremendously curious about the nature of the world around them and they're certainly capable of, if not understanding why, exploring what.<endOfText>
<bot>I took my godson, Dominic Robinson, round my laboratory the other day, which is a physics laboratory, and he enjoyed it immensely and asked a number of questions, and was absolutely intrigued and fascinated by the various bits of wires and plugs and so on like that, and he asked me the sort of questions that I don't think I would expect sometimes my  undergraduates to ask.<endOfText>
<human>They were perhaps stemmed from innocence, but they were very searching and very real questions, and he was obviously very excited to ask them and to listen to some of the answers.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you think we perhaps put kids off an interest in science by our sort of insistence that they have to have a solid understanding of Newton's laws and all sorts of principles, and we lose the magic too early?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I'm sure we do, and I think that's to do with our notions of what science is.<endOfText>
<bot>There's a mystique which has built up about it.<endOfText>
<human>Anybody who's worked in graduate or postgraduate level in science likes almost to continue that mystique.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, we do put children off by being rigid because a child, I am sure, doesn't see the world in a rigid way.<endOfText>
<human>What's out there is all out there.<endOfText>
<bot>Bits of his universe are to do with art and colour and drawing.<endOfText>
<human>I mean if you watch a child, and I have a seven year old boy, playing stacking cards or dominoes is the current thing in our house, watching them stack them and then knocking them off and watching them fall and the way they fall, the amount of work which is involved there in structures and forces and the nature of gravity and the way things behave under gravity fascinate them.<endOfText>
<bot>The problem, of course, is most of us couldn't give a sensible reply to the very searching questions they ask, so we tend to say something like ‘that's a fascinating questions, but you'll have to wait till you're older and ask a scientist’.<endOfText>
<human>That's not the children's mistake, that's ours, because we couldn't actually for the best part respond in a meaningful way.<endOfText>
<bot>And in another sense what we don't do often is to actually recognize the significance of the child's question because of the language he puts it in.<endOfText>
<human>He asks something which, you know, I mean the way they do, what is life, and you wouldn't know — unless you're perhaps trained or awake to the significance of what the child is actually asking — you wouldn't know how to respond to that, so you tend to put it off.<endOfText>
<bot>You mentioned that schools are quite good at biology, that they have guinea pigs and they have growing plants and so forth, and I think you hinted at the fact that they perhaps are not quite so good at maybe the harder sciences, we might  call them, of physics and chemistry.<endOfText>
<human>Is that the case and, if so, what can we do about it at an early stage?<endOfText>
<bot>I believe that is the case, and I believe that again is a reflection of us as adults erm and not an indictment of teachers.<endOfText>
<human>They show great pedagogic skills in almost every aspect of school life.<endOfText>
<bot>Most of us, as people who live in this world, are interested in our environment, and even if not young we certainly grow to appreciate it and to learn a bit about flowers and the way animals live and work in our garden and watching David Attenborough on television and erm we have a genuine interest because as part of this world we know it and come to understand it, and probably feel, therefore, if even if you're not a biology specialist, which you certainly don't have to be by any means, when a child asks a question about, you know, ‘where do the flies go in winter?’ and ‘why's the hamster gone to sleep for three months?’we feel more capable of answering it because we're closer to it ourselves and those are the sorts of questions that people told us.<endOfText>
<human>When a child asks a question about something dropping from a height — does it get faster and it falls for longer and longer?— that probably is a question that most teachers who are not trained in the physical sciences just cannot answer.<endOfText>
<bot>What can we do about it?<endOfText>
<human>I think at the end it must come down to two things; one basically a change in attitude — we have to come to recognise that we live in a very, very technological society, that most of us were born before man walked on the moon, but the kids in school were born in an age when man had walked on the moon ten years ago and they live in a world which is very scientific, and we have to recognise that — and the other one is practical sense, I think, where we really have to look seriously to in-service training of teachers, a) and b) we have to look carefully at the way we train teachers now.<endOfText>
<bot>In many institutions which train primary and first school teachers, the teachers themselves have an option as to whether they can do a science course or not and then even if they do it it's usually very biologically biased erm towards the natural sciences.<endOfText>
<human>At Sussex we actually make a third of the time they spend on the university component of their courses compulsory work in science — that is to say every student does it — so we can actually do something about it practically by looking at our processes of initial training and coming to realise what an important section of the world this is and training teachers accordingly, and not to leave it at that but to continue with erm progressive and planned in-service training of teachers.<endOfText>
<bot>Our own experience from several of the projects that we've been looking at which are in-service type projects, is that when we do train teachers and when we do put an investment in it, we see the pay-off in the schools that physical science does get done in schools, it is fun and it is exciting.<endOfText>
<human>It's when the teachers think this is a boring, mundane, difficult thing to do, then that tends to be put over to the children and of course the disaster is that the children will believe it, and it if the children will believe it then we grow up in a highly technological society producing very few technologists or scientists.<endOfText>
<bot>What you describe does sound a little bit like a chicken and egg situation from the point of view that I think you were saying that erm many teachers are ill-equipped, actually, to teach erm physics, perhaps, and chemistry, whereas they are a little bit better able to get across fundamental ideas in biology, and in a sense because of this they are going to produce another generation who perhaps have very ill-founded ideas of these basic sciences and so on and so forth, and somehow one's got to cut into this cycle and actually improve it, improve the output somehow.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, the chicken and egg syndrome is interesting because  and I agree it is a viscious circle, but in fact you don't make new omelettes unless you do break some eggs, and I think the time has come to break some eggs and I think that's what I'm advocating is that it will come from the teacher because the teacher is the guiding light of what happens in the classroom, and if the teacher has it in the back of their mind there will be no science, then there will be no science.<endOfText>
<bot>If, on the other hand, the teacher has it in the back of their mind always to be aware of the possibility of bringing into the work that's going on in the classroom and bringing all they're usually very excellent pedagogic skills to bear on it, aspects of the physical sciences, so that the children can get an early and meaningful introduction to it, then it will happen.<endOfText>
<human>The question is how do you break into the cycle and make that happen, and I think the answer is, as I said, in two ways — one by making teachers more aware during their period of initial training, either at college or at university or polytechnic, and secondly by looking very carefully at the amount and type of in-service training erm that goes on for teachers once they've left college and are in the schools.<endOfText>
<bot>Essentially what you're saying is that a teacher who's actually teaching you ought to be able to say to that teacher ‘look, here's a package, if you like, that you can insert into your range of skills, and these are of things that you can do with children which are worthwhile doing and fairly easily for you to acquire skills yourself, and they will be very good and helpful for the children’.<endOfText>
<human>Well I'd only say that initially erm because then what you end up with is a sort of lucky dip which every now and then somebody will remember the bag of science tricks that somebody's taught them and dip into.<endOfText>
<bot>Now I think that's better than nothing, but I think one has to take it a stage further than that and say that erm the concepts and the processes in science do build logically one upon the other, in a coherent and meaningful way, and that's important for teachers to appreciate what that meaningful sequence is and that, you know, the lucky dip idea is, as I have said, better than nothing, but it's so much inferior to the notion that teachers should be aware that there is a progression in science and that they can teach children progressively from a very early age onwards and build meaningful knowledge upon meaningful knowledge.<endOfText>
<human>Is there anything that parents can do?<endOfText>
<bot>Christmas is coming up and there are chemistry sets in the shops.<endOfText>
<human>Do these make good gifts from a scientific point of view?<endOfText>
<bot>Well they're a lot of fun and kids love them.<endOfText>
<human>As I commented a little earlier to somebody, I still haven't quite forgiven my mother-in-law for the chemistry set she bought my seven-year-old.<endOfText>
<bot>He is absolutely amazed by it and spends lots of time in a garage at the back, which actually means that I spend an awful lot of time  in that garage in the cold too!<endOfText>
<human>Yes, they are good sets and they do  they are exciting for children.<endOfText>
<bot>They do enjoy them and they do make good use of them.<endOfText>
<human>Quite often they need a lot of erm time spent by the parent with the child, and if the parent's happy with that they're fine.<endOfText>
<bot>None of them, or very few of them, if you buy a good quality one is dangerous.<endOfText>
<human>It's very important, I think, that erm you match the age of the child to the age which is written on the box, because then the child will actually be handling materials that he can physically handle and ideas that he can physically cope with or intellectually cope with.<endOfText>
<bot>So they are probably very useful erm toys, educational toys, to have in the home, but I think for the child to get the maximum from them they do  he often does require an adult with him.<endOfText>
<human>How about electronic kits and circuits?<endOfText>
<bot>Are they worthwhile, would you say?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, they are; they are very much.<endOfText>
<bot>Again, it's a questin of matching the kit to the age of the child because some of them erm — the one we have at home, for example, plugs into the mains and although it only pushes out six or nine volts at the end the child actually does have to plug it in and, well I don't think I'd be happy if my six or seven year old was doing that, although my nine year old could cope with it quite happily.<endOfText>
<human>So they are useful erm children can learn a lot.<endOfText>
<bot>What I like about them and where I think their strengths are is that they do put science, the physical sciences, in that bracket of activity which is fun, excitement and leisure and enjoyment and that it moves away from the notion that it's something you do on a wet Friday afternoon at school.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you very much, Mike.<endOfText>
<bot>That's all that we have time for today.<endOfText>
<human>Next week I shall be talking to Peter Abbs about teaching the arts and he will be reading some very interesting children's poetry.<endOfText>
<bot>Until next week then, goodbye.<endOfText>
<human>Dr Brian Smith from the University Sussex.<endOfText>
<bot>Now the Brighton Polytechnic and Mary Donoghue.<endOfText>
<human>Hello.<endOfText>
<bot>Dyslexia is a common learning difficulty, but one that's hard to define and sometimes very hard to cope with.<endOfText>
<human>For the next three weeks on Ideas in Action we'll discuss some practical ways that parents and teachers can help dyslexic children.<endOfText>
<bot>Today we'll hear from polytechnic lecturer Reg James, who's just made a film of the special needs Brickwall School, and from local remedial tutor Dave Pollock, who'll give us some suggestions for teacing dyslexic children.<endOfText>
<human>Reg, let's start with the most obvious question first.<endOfText>
<bot>What is dyslexia?<endOfText>
<human>Well it's something that's very difficult to define in a way I think that's satisfactory.<endOfText>
<bot>What has been taken as kind of definition, which I'll paraphrase I think for this purpose, is that it's a condition that shows itself in children's reading difficulty and erm that they are having this reading difficulty despite the fact that they have had reasonable, normal teaching, that their level of intelligence appears to be normal and that they come from an adequate social cultural background.<endOfText>
<human>Over and above that we think in a sense that it's a series of disabilities, of intellectual functioning, and although it's not by any means proven, we think that these are probably constitutional in origin.<endOfText>
<bot>Dave, would you agree with that definition?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, if I could just extend it a little.<endOfText>
<bot>I feel that it shows itself in the contrast between the child's — we're talking about children for the moment, although obviously there are dyslexic adults — it shows itself in the contrast between the person's ability to express him or herself in words and their ability to put it down on paper and to read it off paper, and it's this contrast which often arouses one's suspicions that there might be some problem and, having gone into it a little, we find that it stems from a failure of the sensory motor system — the brain isn't processing the information it's receiving through the ear and eye.<endOfText>
<human>How would you both respond to a common allegation that dyslexia is a middle class disease?<endOfText>
<bot>I think that's a very unfair kind of criticism.<endOfText>
<human>I've not had the experience perhaps of teaching so many dyslexic children to be able to comment on this, but certainly when I was making the videotape at Brickwall School  and I asked the headmaster about that and he pointed to the fact that they certainly have a very wide intake, a complete social mix, and Professor Miles at Bangor University says that in his experience of dealing with dyslexic children they come from all walks of life, and it's really quite inaccurate — I suppose there's a sense in which, if we've got to use these phrases, that middle class people have always been very concerned about the education of their children and so they may be the parents who will ask questions about their children's lack of development, but I think it's only, you know, more significant in middle class terms because of that.<endOfText>
<bot>Dave, what's your response?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I agree absolutely with Reg there.<endOfText>
<bot>I've come across, and still regularly do come across, people of all ages, both sexes and all social classes, who have this kind of problem.<endOfText>
<human>Given general definitional problems with dyslexia and learning difficulties generally, what practical suggestions can you offer to teachers of children with learning difficulties?<endOfText>
<bot>Reg.<endOfText>
<human>The most essential thing, in a sense, is to give teachers enough information about this condition and the kind of difficulties it creates so that they can recognise it.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know whether David would agree, but my experience as a teacher was that I certainly encountered, I realize now, in my teaching career, children with dyslexia and yet no-one had told me, in my training, anything about this condition and I don't think I was in a position until later, in a sense, to recognise that I had seen children with this difficulty.<endOfText>
<human>So that I feel that one of the things that we must do is ensure that all people who are now training to be teachers, and those who already in the service, have got to be given more information about the condition so that they may be able to recognise it.<endOfText>
<bot>Dave, you did a P G C E course at Sussex.<endOfText>
<human>Did you feel that students there were receiving adequate information about dyslexia?<endOfText>
<bot>No, I'm afraid I didn't.<endOfText>
<human>The P G C is a difficult course to fill, really, for the people who are organising it, because although it's called a one-year course, in fact it lasts eight months in practice, and there are so many aspects that have to be fitted in something has to go.<endOfText>
<bot>It's difficult enough, I think, to fit enough work on ordinary reading, if you like, let alone specific problems.<endOfText>
<human>I went into dyslexia because when I did that course we had the opportunity to do a special study of a subject of our own choice and I spent a lot of time on dyslexia because I was already interested in it before I started.<endOfText>
<bot>But suppose now  suppose I were a middle-aged to elderly teacher who had never come across dyslexia until recently and was now aware that he or she had dyslexic pupils, the first thing to do, I think, is to inform yourself.<endOfText>
<human>There are courses that one can do, extra post-experience courses once can follow.<endOfText>
<bot>The Dyslexia Institute is a mine of information.<endOfText>
<human>Local Dyslexia Associations are also full of information, and there are by now quite a lot of books which have been published which are — both for parents and teachers — which are veyr easy to follow and don't necessarily involve one in many evenings and weekends of cudgelling the brain.<endOfText>
<bot>Now suppose you've got a dyslexic child in your class, or one that you think may be — I can suggest various don'ts.<endOfText>
<human>The first don't is not to believe that the child is lazy because he or she is not managing to spell.<endOfText>
<bot>Very often, as we've mentioned already in this programme, there's contrast between alertness, brightness, whatever you call it, with words in speech and the disability in writing it down.<endOfText>
<human>So because there's this contrast the child isn't necessarily playing up or not bothering.<endOfText>
<bot>Also the dyslexic child is not necessarily unintelligent because he can't write something which you've just written on the blackboard or which has only just been shown to him in some other way; the dyslexic person can't look up at a blackboard, hold the visual symbols in her mind and get them down on paper in a different position.<endOfText>
<human>If the nature of dyslexia is borne in mind by the teacher, then the child's confidence won't necessarily be undermined.<endOfText>
<bot>So many dyslexic children have been reduced to a state of dreadful anxiety by teachers who've called them stupid in front of the other children.<endOfText>
<human>Could I just take you back, David, on the point where you're talking about the things that the teacher might recognise.<endOfText>
<bot>It seems to me that another problem, as far as the teacher is concerned, is the inconsistency in the dyslexic child's performance.<endOfText>
<human>The fact that the teacher finds that the child has spelt a word correctly in one context and then perhaps in a sentence or two later may misspell the word, makes the teacher think that this is a question of carelessness, where we know, in fact, that is a feature of dylexia — that you may be able to get a spelling correct in one context and yet you will misspell it, as it were, a few moments later.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, right, I think maybe this is the moment where we could list some of the signs of dyslexia, both for parents and teachers, and indeed I hope there may be some educational psychologists who have some doubts who might like to enter into some erm dialogue with us.<endOfText>
<human>Now I would like to isolate six possible areas of difficulty where dyslexic people will indicate signs of having a problem.<endOfText>
<bot>The first one is visual and auditory discrimination — now there's lovely bits of jargon for you — that means the ability to differentiate between symbols when they're written and to differentiate between different sounds, particularly highly frequency sounds.<endOfText>
<human>Then there's the question of the association of sounds and symbols; now the average person, when learning to read, can be shown a letter, told the letter most commonly makes this sound, whatever it may be, and associate the two very quickly.<endOfText>
<bot>The dyslexic person has great difficulty with this.<endOfText>
<human>Then we come to the problem of sequencing which, one again, can be visual and auditory and connected with the hearing.<endOfText>
<bot>In order to spell, one has to combine both kinds of sequence, one has to think of the syllables in the word in the correct order and remember them and remember how far you got, and also remember the sequence of visual symbols, i.e. letters on paper.<endOfText>
<human>Sequencing is very often a the root of the dyslexic problem, not only in writing and reading, but also in remembering other kinds of sequence, like time sequence, which brings us to the next point.<endOfText>
<bot>erm sequences such as what happened yesterday, what happened today, what's going to happen tomorrow — dyslexic people very often have great difficulty with this and transferring from the two dimensional to the three dimensional, like you might say to a dyslexic adult when he or she asks directions, ‘Oh, well, it's first right, second left and then there's a tower on your right and you've got to turn to the left after the tree’ and so on, and a dyslexic person can't remember any of that at all , or transfer it from the map to the reality.<endOfText>
<human>Last of all, we must mention orientation.<endOfText>
<bot>When we write we scan across and move our hands from left to right.<endOfText>
<human>When we read we scan a line of print from left to right.<endOfText>
<bot>This doesn't come automatically to a dyslexic person very often, and we also look at letters from left to right, but if you look at a u and then turn it upside down in your mind, you have an n, or h and y can be reversed to turn into each other, if you like, in the same way.<endOfText>
<human>b and d is a problem which a lot of dyslexic children have.<endOfText>
<bot>Teachers should be aware, particularly of that aspect, I think, because phonic method is very often used in schools, by which I mean that the teacher wil hold up a flash card, and on it would be a pair of letters, say, suppose for example sh the teacher will hold up a large card with sh on it and will say to the class ‘this is shuss’ and the children will all say shuss whenever this card is held up — that's fine, but the dyslexic pupil may not be seeing sh in the same way that the other children are.<endOfText>
<human>They may be seeing hs, or backwards s backwards h, or backwards h backwards s — the permutations are, in fact, considerable the more you think about it, and once again I'd like to repeat that the teacher should be aware of the possibility that not all the class are actually seeing what she thinks they might be seeing.<endOfText>
<bot>Reg, can you add to any practical teaching suggestions?<endOfText>
<human>One point I'd just like to add to what David was just saying there was that when you were talking about those orientation problems, when we were making the film of the children at Brickwall, what was brought home to me very strongly was that these sort of problems can arise in mathematics, as well as in reading.<endOfText>
<bot>If you think about the problems that there are with mathematics, whereby it's not just a question of scanning print from left to right, but that you were involved in processes where sometimes you're moving from left to right and sometimes from right to left, sometimes vertically.<endOfText>
<human>Dyslexic children can have difficulties as far as  of mathematics as well as reading.<endOfText>
<bot>What changes in the teacher training curriculum would you both like to see in order to improve teacher recognition of learning difficulties?<endOfText>
<human>The first thing to do is to have a major component of the reading section to include dyslexia, with erm instruction of trainee teachers, not only in how to recognise the problem, but also how to do something about it, and how to use the education system to bring support for parents and pupils.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, I think that as David said one of the things that we've been working at very hard in recent years in teacher training is to try to improve the quality and the content of reading courses generally, and then I think it is also necessary to draw attention to teachers of this problem of dyslexia.<endOfText>
<human>I favour the notion that it often should be more detailed work on dyslexia as probably can be done in the postexperience courses.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that teachers need to know people that they can turn to for further advice, but that they could familiarize themselves much more with what, as it were, they can do in the first instance by screening children, by using  there are number of published materials, learning inventories, that can be used to discover whether a child has some difficulties that might point in this direction of dyslexia.<endOfText>
<human>For example, Aston University have published some very helpful materials to help teachers in the classroom identify these difficulties.<endOfText>
<bot>Now I've used that as an illustration because I think these are some of the best materials that have been produced in this country, but there are other learning inventories and tests which can be used to help teachers find out whether they think that children have got these dyslexic difficulties.<endOfText>
<human>Could I just add something also there, that training of teachers, after they've done their initial training is becoming increasingly cut, of course, by the government.<endOfText>
<bot>It is all very well for us to sit here and tell teachers to go on extra courses, but they're finding that there aren't any left, so the next thing that they can turn to  the next person they can turn to is the educational psychologist.<endOfText>
<human>There is one for every school, of course, and this psychologist should have had more training in perceptual handicaps than an ordinary classroom teacher, and should be available to help assess the child and give advice to teachers and parents about how to help them.<endOfText>
<bot>Many thanks to Reg James and Dave Pollock.<endOfText>
<human>Next week on Ideas in Action we'll discuss some of the options open to the parents of dyslexic children.<endOfText>
<bot>Until then, goodbye.<endOfText>
<human>Hello.<endOfText>
<bot>In this last programme in our short series on the boundaries of science, we're going to look at one aspect of that most baffling and intriguing subject, the origin of life.<endOfText>
<human>Harry Kroto is a chemist at the University, who a few years ago, in collaboration with a colleague and a student, discovered something about interstellar space that has forced scientists to reconsider their views.<endOfText>
<bot>Harry, what did you discover?<endOfText>
<human>Well we discovered that there were some compounds in interstellar space that we were really rather more complicated than had previously been thought possible, and these molecules had infeasible prebiotic species, in that there were very simple reactions that could take place that would allow them to form amino acids and other rather intriguing biological molecules.<endOfText>
<bot>Presumably one thought that, in the early days in the universe as it were, the atoms and molecules that existed were very simple ones?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I think that is true.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean the view that astronomers and most scientists and people who are interested in astronomy had was that there might be a few molecules in space, probably not very many, but if there were they would be very, very simple, probably one or two atoms, perhaps things like water, perhaps things like ammonia, and things like methane — molecules with a large amount of hydrogen attached to them and in fact a thermodynamically staple species.<endOfText>
<human>Now what has happened in the last decade or so, through the advent of radioastronomy, is that we've discovered that there are vast clouds of molecules between the stars and they're just chock a block with very intriguing molecules, many of which are just the sort of things we would expect to be in the prebiotic soup.<endOfText>
<bot>What do you mean by prebiotic?<endOfText>
<human>Prebiotic means erm a system whereby biological processes have not actually started, but would contain many of the basic building blocks for a biological system.<endOfText>
<bot>Why is it that these molecules weren't discovered earlier?<endOfText>
<human>Well the major advance that was made in the late Sixties and early Seventies was in radioastronomy, where large radio telescopes with computer control and very high sensitivity were developed.<endOfText>
<bot>One reason was for communications, but another reason that was rather intriguing to scientists was that they could actually look at stars and look at the space between the stars and use a different region of the spectrum, in particular the radio region.<endOfText>
<human>Previously one's knowledge of stars comes from the light that comes in in the optical range and the visible range, or in perhaps the ultra violet if you can put a satellite above the atmosphere.<endOfText>
<bot>Perhaps you can use infra-red dectors, but the radio telescope allowed astronomers to look in the radio range.<endOfText>
<human>It turned out that radio astronomy of this kind looked at extremely low temperature regions.<endOfText>
<bot>One looks at a star, one sees radiation from an object which may have a surface temperature of many thousands of degrees — in fact, internal temperatures of millions of degrees, but with a radio telescope one's looking at very, very cold regions and these were totally inaccessible before the advent of radio astronomy, or of this type anyway, and for the first time one was able to see material spread between the stars rather thinly, but in fact in a very cold state.<endOfText>
<human>What sort of molecules have you been discovering?<endOfText>
<bot>Well the original discoveries were of some fairly simple molecules.<endOfText>
<human>People thought well what could be in space, they'd tune the radio telescope and they found, rather intriguingly, there were molecules like water and ammonia and methane, just as they expected.<endOfText>
<bot>Then, as they looked a little bit further and were a bit more adventurous, they found that there were some more interesting molecules such as alcohol.<endOfText>
<human>I mean molecules that are rather larger, molecules that actually are rather important in biological systems.<endOfText>
<bot>But these were fairly understandable.<endOfText>
<human>But as time went on and techniques advanced, they found that peculiar sorts of molecules turned up, rather unusual ones, things that weren't expected — molecules that are very uncommon on the earth and in fact a number of molecules were discovered in interstellar space before they were discovered in the laboratory.<endOfText>
<bot>This showed that the conditions in space were unusual and that unusual chemical processes were taking place, and they were then producing molecules that we didn't expect.<endOfText>
<human>In fact, the chemistry on the earth is rather special — it's the sort of chemistry we're used to doing at the temperature on the earth in the conditions that occur on the earth, but interspatial space the conditions are quite different and so, in fact, it turns out the chemistry is different, and so also we find that there are molecules that we don't expect.<endOfText>
<bot>One thing that we did was find that there were molecules much, much bigger than was expected in the sense that there were many, many more carbon atoms involved than had previously been thought possible, and even now we just do not understand the processes whereby they are formed.<endOfText>
<human>Are you saying that there are molecules out there in space which we just cannot form ourselves in a laboratory?<endOfText>
<bot>There are molecules in space that we would have great difficulty making in the laboratory.<endOfText>
<human>I think we could do it now that we know something more about space.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, we could probably make them, but they would be rather difficult.<endOfText>
<human>For one reason, space is almost a vacuum, so that molecules erm are few and far between, and one thing about chemistry it is really the science of not particularly molecules but molecules that react with one another, but here once one has got a molecule in space it doesn't actually meet another one for a very long time, so even a molecule that is reactive and which may only last for maybe a microsecond in the laboratory, interstellar space it may last for a thousand years.<endOfText>
<bot>So we find that there's an intriguing chemistry going on in space that it would be very difficult for us to reproduce in the laboratory.<endOfText>
<human>But I think the ingenuity of chemists and scientists and physicists and astronomers is such that, yes, we could do it — if we knew what we were looking for and had the right ideas.<endOfText>
<bot>What we're finding is that the discoveries in interstellar space are making us try new experiments and erm try and reproduce these conditions, perhaps in the laboratory, and then go on to discover new molecules in space and understand the processes that give rise to the molecules.<endOfText>
<human>How did people think that prebiotic organic compounds were formed before this discovery in outer space?<endOfText>
<bot>Some rather nice experiments were carried out, perhaps in the Forties and Fifties, by Uray and Miller, who thought that the early atmosphere mainly contained methane, water and ammonia, mainly hydrogenated species which were thermodynamically stable, and they thought that perhaps if one put a discharge or if volcanic processes could actually inject energy into such a system and form the more complicated and more energetic molecules required for biology to actually get started.<endOfText>
<human>Now this is a good idea, and in fact there's a fair amount of circumstantial evidence that geologists and astronomers who know something about the earth's atmosphere have looked into to suggest that this is quite a feasible mechanism for the formation of prebiotic molecules.<endOfText>
<bot>Now the curious thing was that if you looked at the early atmosphere, the molecules in that were the molecules that we expected to see in interstellar space.<endOfText>
<human>After the violent conditions that erm we think occurred in the early life of the earth and injected energy and churned up the atmosphere and formed the prebiotic molecules, we find that just those same molecules are actually in the clouds in space, and these clouds are the basic raw material from which stars and plants form in the first place, so we might ask the question could they have got into the earth's atmosphere without this intermediate process, and I think there are mechanisms whereby these molecules can accrete into the earth's atmosphere, and it certainly suggests that we should look at thse and certainly not be taken as a foregone conclusion that the Uray/Miller experiments are the only mechanism whereby the prebiotic soup was formed.<endOfText>
<bot>You say that you found interstellar space being pretty cold, there are some variations of temperature within it, aren't there?<endOfText>
<human>Well temperature, of course, is a very complicated thing, but let's assume we do understand what temperature means.<endOfText>
<bot>There are regions of space, and for the most part in these dense clouds between the stars, that have temperatures perhaps ten degrees above absolute zero, maybe as much as fifty degrees above absolute zero, so that's about minus two hundred and fifty degrees centigrade.<endOfText>
<human>But what happens in these clouds is that certain parts of them, certain areas of the cloud start to collapse, and as they collapse the temperature rises and the collapse increases, and as the temperature rises through a thousand to a million degrees we find that these are the regions where stars form, and it is really the major discovery, as far as astronomy is concerned, of the radio research that we now know a lot more about the early stages of star formation.<endOfText>
<bot>And as we believe that erm the earth and the sun were formed at the same time, so we're starting to know a lot more about the original material from which the sun and the earth were formed, and here we find that it's just full of prebiotic molecules which we did not know beforehand and therefore puts a different perspective on what we think the earth's early atmosphere might have been.<endOfText>
<human>How was the astronomy actually done?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I had a colleague in Canada who's a very close friend of mind, and erm I knew that he had actually done some radio astronomy.<endOfText>
<human>He was a chemist himself, or a physicist, working on similar sorts of problems, and I wrote to him and said was he interested in looking at one of my molecules, and he wrote back and said he was very interested because it was, in fact, as I'd thought, a rather intriguing next step in our understanding and we got together with the Canadian group in Ottowa to try and set up a programme for observing these particular types of molecule in interstellar space.<endOfText>
<bot>It was, in fact, at the time just erm well let's try it and see.<endOfText>
<human>I didn't have very much hope because it was really much more complicated than any other molecule that had been discovered.<endOfText>
<bot>It was almost a quantum leap in some ways.<endOfText>
<human>And to our great surprise this molecule was, in fact, quite abundant.<endOfText>
<bot>Then the next step was very clear — that we should make the next molecule, which was rather more complicated, and look for that.<endOfText>
<human>To our disbelief it was really very much more abundant than we could ever have thought possible, so we've actually been able to find molecules with eleven carbon atoms in a chain, floating around in space, and for which we really at the present time have no explanation.<endOfText>
<bot>And astronomers would never have looked in that area, in that region, perhaps radio astronomy, unless you'd asked them to?<endOfText>
<human>Well I certainly wouldn't have thought about it, and I don't think any chemist would have believed it, and in fact what happened was it really came from this other esoteric sort of project that we were doing.<endOfText>
<bot>Had I wanted to do something in astronomy, which I did actually want to do because I'd taken an interest in it, in fact I would not have thought of this type of molecule.<endOfText>
<human>It was just not even in question.<endOfText>
<bot>It was just ‘oh well, this might be interesting.<endOfText>
<human>It is a bit unlikely, but let's try it.’<endOfText>
<bot>Then it turned out to be rather unusually abundant and erm we now have the problem of trying to understand why it's there in the first place.<endOfText>
<human>One interesting feature of this discovery seems to me that it's been a combination of different individuals approaching it almost laterally, in a sense, because you're not an astronomer, particularly, are you?<endOfText>
<bot>No, I'm not even an astronomer now really in many ways.<endOfText>
<human>I mean I've never looked through a telescope.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean I have helped to run a radio telescope.<endOfText>
<human>We don't actually look at that — a radio telescope is a rather superb radio set with a rather large ariel.<endOfText>
<bot>And all this started with you actually putting an undergraduate student on the project?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, one of the nice aspects of astronomy is that it brings people from many different areas of science together.<endOfText>
<bot>What actually happened was that a colleague of mine, Dave Walton and I, got together to look at a rather esoteric aspect of molecular motion, thinking of making molecules which were very, very long and had very simple structure but could have perhaps erm very complicated what we call dynamic motion, but there was some very good chemistry involved and we erm put this project together for the Sussex Chemistry Bithesis programme, and erm the student who took on this particular project, Alexander, spent two years learning how to do the synthesis and developed a lot of ability in this area; he also learned how to do the spectroscopic experiments and studied the analysis of molecular motion, and he was able to do this on top of the course work that he did, and in fact this particular project and Alexander, who did the work himself, and the subsequent exciting sort of repercussions of the project have all made me a rather firm believer in the course here, and that in fact undergraduates can do research and also that it's a very good training for the future.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you very much, Harry.<endOfText>
<bot>Hello.<endOfText>
<human>In this short series we're exploring some of the boundaries of science — the limits to what we can measure or experience, limits that exist in space, time, temperature and so on.<endOfText>
<bot>Last week, for example we were looking at the mind boggling distances that we encounter when we journey across the universe.<endOfText>
<human>Today we travel to the other extreme and enter the microscopic world of the atom and its nucleus.<endOfText>
<bot>Jim Byrne is a physicist who work as the university.<endOfText>
<human>I recently asked him how large an atom is.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, of course, there are big atoms and small atoms  hydrogen is a very small atom, uranium is a big atom — but something of the order of ten to the minus eight of a centimetre.<endOfText>
<human>Roughly a hundred million atoms per centimetre.<endOfText>
<bot>So that means if you could line up a hundred million atoms you'd just reach one centimetre?<endOfText>
<human>Just about one centimetre for relatively small atoms, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>And virtually all matter is composed of atoms?<endOfText>
<human>All matter that we know is composed of atoms.<endOfText>
<bot>The familiar matter that we deal with in our ordinary life, that's jsut atoms, yes.<endOfText>
<human>And putting combinations of atoms together you get molecules and up to really rather long and complicated molecules?<endOfText>
<bot>That's so, indeed.<endOfText>
<human>That's going in one direction of building up.<endOfText>
<bot>mhm<endOfText>
<human>And going in the other direction, what do you have inside atoms?<endOfText>
<bot>Are atoms solid things, or are they all space or what?<endOfText>
<human>No, atoms are not solid things.<endOfText>
<bot>This is the great discovery that Rutherford and his erm collaborators made forty/fifty years ago.<endOfText>
<human>In fact atoms are almost entirely made up of free space.<endOfText>
<bot>Essentially, what you have inside an atom is you have a very small mass of core, called the nucleus, and around this nucleus you have lighter particles called electrons, which orbit in closed orbits.<endOfText>
<human>Now this is the picture that we have.<endOfText>
<bot>These are negative particles and the nucleus is made up of positively charged and neutral particles and the combination is kept together by electrostatic forces.<endOfText>
<human>So the nucleus itself is not solid.<endOfText>
<bot>It itself consists of particles?<endOfText>
<human>Well of course it's rather more solid than the atom is.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean if you think that an atom is, as we said, typically ten to the minus eight of a centimetre, then a nucleus is typically ten to the minus twelve of a centimetre, so that's four orders of magnitude down, so the nucleus itself, if you scaled the whole thing down by a factor of ten to the four, the neucleus itself again is made up of a fair amount of free space and loss of particles inside it.<endOfText>
<human>If you've got a positive nucleus and you've got electrons, negative particles going round it, and the two attract each other, why don't they just all collapse together?<endOfText>
<bot>Well of course this was the great argument that went on.<endOfText>
<human>I mean when Rutherford did his experiments years and years ago he produced his planetary model of the nucleus, of the atom where the nucleus plays the role of the sun and the electrons play the role of the planets, and people said well why don't they just spiral in an erm Rutherford had actually no answer to this, but the answer to this was produced by the Danish physicist Nils Bore, who said ‘Well they don't spiral in because erm electrons cannot just take up any orbit, they can take up certain specified orbits which he called stationary states, and there is a lowest one of these, and when the electron gets down there it cannot go any further.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I'm sure that's the right answer, but we're already getting a little bit complicated in our vision of what's happening.<endOfText>
<human>Let's go inside the nucleus a little bit.<endOfText>
<bot>The nucleus isn't solid, it consists of other particles — what sort of particles are these?<endOfText>
<human>Well, erm the nucleus is not solid, but the particles in it are much more massive than electrons.<endOfText>
<bot>If you look at the particles inside the nucleus you have a proton, which is a positively charged particle, and it's about two thousand times more massive than an electron, and you have also have another type of particle in there called a neutron, and a neutron is to all practical intents and purposes it's just like a proton except that it has no charge, and so the whole mass of the atom is actually concentrated inside the nucleus.<endOfText>
<human>The electrons balance the forces of course, but they don't really contribute to the mass.<endOfText>
<bot>So what we have inside the nucleus, we have two kinds of particle, the neutron, which is uncharged, and the proton which is positively charged.<endOfText>
<human>And you get smaller particles out of the neutrons and protons?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, you can get hosts of smaller particles if you do various things.<endOfText>
<human>I mean you're getting into quite deep water here.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's go back a little bit.<endOfText>
<human>I mean if you ask what happens when electrons drop down from one orbit to another inside the atom, the emit light, which is the thing we are familiar with, but erm physicists tend to think of this as particles which they call photons.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, we you have neutrons and protons, they interact one with the other, but the particle that carries the interaction is not the photon, it's the new particle called the meson, and you have got smaller particles, much less massive particles than neutrons and protons, and these are called mesons or pye mesons, and the pye meson has erm a mass which is typically a tenth of that of a proton.<endOfText>
<human>So if you collide neutrons and protons, bang them one off the other, you can produce these mesons.<endOfText>
<bot>How do you know these particles actually exist?<endOfText>
<human>Well I mean how do you know that, for example, light exists?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean if you put your hand up to the sun you can feel it, you detect it, your eyes detect it, well you have detectors which detect them and, for example, if I want to detect something like an electron well then I can make a counter which is sensitive to charged particles like electrons, and I can allow these electrons to hit this counter and it will produce erm an identifiable electrical pulse and I can look at that and I can say this is an electron, or I can look at other particles, say, for things like helium nuclei which are called alpha particles, and I can make counters which will detect these and I can put a little piece of paper in front and I can stop off the alpha particles.<endOfText>
<human>We know they exist because we can do things with them.<endOfText>
<bot>We can actually see practical effects which follow from usin them.<endOfText>
<human>You can't see a proton because proton is too small erm the only things that you can see are microscopic bodies and again you only infer the existence of these microscopic bodies because you actually detect the light that comes from them.<endOfText>
<bot>Somehow or other your miond analyzes the light that it receives from these bodies and tells you about them.<endOfText>
<human>In a sense you can do the same thing, of course, with erm elementary particles like neutrons and protons, but the process of interpretation is much more complicated.<endOfText>
<bot>Continuing our journey to ever smaller particles, can we break up the pye meson into anything smaller?<endOfText>
<human>Well you don't actually have to do that with the pye meson because if it erm if you have a pye meson it just breaks up itself.<endOfText>
<bot>If erm, for example, I were to produce a beam of pye mesons, which I can do by taking very high energy protons and making them collide with ordinary hydrogen, then the pyon will come out and it will not live for very long, and I think the lifetime of a pyon is something of the order of ten to the minus eight of a second, which means that pyons only live for about one hundred millionth of a second, and these things then decay into othe particles and these other particles are called muons and they decay into  not only do they produce muons, but they produce things called neutrinos and the muons themselves do not live for very long — a muon lives for about two microseconds, which is two millionths of a second — and it decays also into an electron and another neutral particle called a neutrionor, and these neutrinors just are there, they exist very  but they are the end products of these decay processes.<endOfText>
<human>You mentioned, very straightforwardly, experiments to find these particles — in fact aren't the experiments rather complicated and requiring big, expensive bits of equipment?<endOfText>
<bot>To produce things like pyons, yes, they are.<endOfText>
<human>You see the thing is produce something like a pyon you have to create enough energy to make it, and in order to create enough energy the you have to produce particles colliding at very high speeds, and in order to produce these particles you have to accelerate them.<endOfText>
<bot>Modern accelerators tend to be rather large machines to produce the very high energy particles required to produce new particles.<endOfText>
<human>Of course pyons have been around now for so long that you don't need high energy machines to produce pyons.<endOfText>
<bot>In America and Canada there are things called pyon factories that'll actually produce massive numbers of pyons for you without any great problems.<endOfText>
<human>And going ever smaller, can you get from neutrinors to smaller particles?<endOfText>
<bot>From neutrinors?<endOfText>
<human>Well we haven't really discussed neutrionors yet.<endOfText>
<bot>We should leave the neutrionors aside for the time being.<endOfText>
<human>erm we really got as far as the neutrons and the protons.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, of course, again if you want to see what a neutron or a proton is made of, I mean a neutron is a very small thing and a proton is a very small thing — it's about ten to the minus thirteen centimetres across.<endOfText>
<human>And if you're going to try and look inside one of these things then you're going to have to use very high energy particles, which in quantum physics means something that is very short wavelength that you can actually look inside, and when you look inside these things by, say, scattering electrons from them, very high energy electrons, it appears that inside a proton and inside a neutron is mainly again just free space, and there are other point like objects inside these particles, and these objects are know as quarks .<endOfText>
<bot>Now no-one's ever seen a quark for the simple reason that no-one has ever managed to produced a free quark.<endOfText>
<human>It appears that neutrons and protons are made up of quarks.<endOfText>
<bot>Each neutron and each protons has got three — they have three quarks each — and these quarks have got very peculiar properties.<endOfText>
<human>The main one that people are interested in, of course, is that they don't have integral charge.<endOfText>
<bot>They don't have one unit of charge.<endOfText>
<human>A quark supposedly has one third charge or two thirds charge, but nobody has ever managed to actually produced a free quark, but people do believe they exist because they explain almost all the properties that neutrons and protons have, and other particles.<endOfText>
<bot>When people talk about quarks they use words like colour and charm and strangeness and other things.<endOfText>
<human>They do, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>I suppose we should really begin at the word strangeness because the word strangeness goes back to the late Fifties, early Sixties, when some people discovered particles more massive than neutrons and protons and these particles were discovered in the erm cosmic radiation, and they were also produced by accelerators in laboratories.<endOfText>
<human>Now what happened was that these particles had very peculiar K properties.<endOfText>
<bot>For example, they lived very much longer than one would have expected, and Gellmann said well these were strange particles and he invented a new quantum number called a strangeness, and then he assumed that this strangeness quantum number was not quite conserved. erm we have conserved quantum numbers in physics like the charge — you have to conserve the charge, but you don't quite have to conserve the strangeness.<endOfText>
<human>So this was a new strange quantum number, and I think really what happened as new quantum numbers became necessary to describe the new types of particles, people just began to think of more sort of strange names like charm and beauty and erm things like this, but they have no real connection with what we normally understand by charm and beauty, they are just quantum numbers.<endOfText>
<bot>Jim, can we go on forever?<endOfText>
<human>Will we find even smaller particles in future years?<endOfText>
<bot>That's a matter of guesswork.<endOfText>
<human>I don't think anybody knows the answer to that.<endOfText>
<bot>I imagine that we will.<endOfText>
<human>I mean in the past in has always turned out that what people have thought to be elementary turns out never to be elementary.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean at one stage we go back a hundred years — back to Dalton  he thought of his atoms as being fundamental entities that could never be broken up, whereas now we know that an atom is a very complicated structure and we can measure things about atoms, we can measure the  distribution, we can where the electrons and so on are.<endOfText>
<human>Nuclei — there's been a tremendous amount of work done on nuclei.<endOfText>
<bot>We know the shapes of nuclei.<endOfText>
<human>We know there are round ones, there are long thin ones, there are cigar shaped ones, there are disc shaped ones.<endOfText>
<bot>They turned out not to be elementary at all, they are complex things.<endOfText>
<human>Neutrons and protons are now believed not to be elementary, that inside them they have quarks.<endOfText>
<bot>Even now there are theories which say that quarks are made up of other things and so on, so I mean who knows.<endOfText>
<human>I think simply it's unknown.<endOfText>
<bot>Jim, I'd love to keep going here and ask you a whole lot more questions.<endOfText>
<human>Unfortunately that's all the time we have today.<endOfText>
<bot>Next week there'll be another programme in our series Ideas in Action.<endOfText>
<human>Until next week then, goodbye.<endOfText>
<bot>Hello.<endOfText>
<human>In this short series we're looking at the boundaries of science, and we're asking questions such as‘How cold can we get?’ and ‘What is the smallest particle that we can envisage?’.<endOfText>
<bot>Today, by contrast, we're going to the other extreme.<endOfText>
<human>We're going to peer into space and try to imagine the huge distances involved.<endOfText>
<bot>Our guide is Robert Smith, who's an astronomer at the university.<endOfText>
<human>Robert, let's start by trying to put ourselves into context.<endOfText>
<bot>We're on a planet.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, and this planet is moving round the sun, which is part of the solar system.<endOfText>
<bot>The solar system contains not only our own planet, but also many other planets, at varying distances from the sun.<endOfText>
<human>And the whole size of the solar system is something like forty astronomical units.<endOfText>
<bot>We're going to have to talk about what astronomical units are in a moment, but let's go on in terms of size.<endOfText>
<human>We're part of this particular system, what comes next?<endOfText>
<bot>The sun is just a star, one of many thousands of millions of stars in our own galaxy, which is the milky way, which we see as we look up in the sky on a very dark night, and it was called the milky way by the ancients because it looked like a splash of milk across the sky, but we now know that it's a flattened system consisting of these thousands of millions of stars.<endOfText>
<human>So we're actually part of the milky way system, the galaxy?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Which is the milky way?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Are there many other galaxies in the universe?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes.<endOfText>
<human>There are thousands of galaxies.<endOfText>
<bot>Millions indeed.<endOfText>
<human>Our galaxy is just an ordinary galaxy among many others.<endOfText>
<bot>It's part of what's called the local group of galaxies which contains about thirty galaxies.<endOfText>
<human>It is, in fact, one of the two largest galaxies in that group and nearby, in astronomical terms at least, there are other such groups containing thirty/forty/fifty galaxies maybe, and these galaxies themselves, these groups, are clustered into larger groups and these groups are glustered into even larger groups, so there are clusters of clusters of clusters of galaxies, right out to the furthest reaches of space.<endOfText>
<bot>All right.<endOfText>
<human>Let's go back to distances.<endOfText>
<bot>Now you mentioned an astronomical unit, what's that?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, well that's just the name the astronomers use for the mean distance, the average distance, of the earth from the sun.<endOfText>
<bot>It's a convenient unit, perhaps a useful way of thinking about it is in terms of the time that light takes about eight minutes to reach us from the sun.<endOfText>
<human>So what you're saying, in terms of the eight minutes, is that something, an event which happens on the sun, which is visible, takes about eight minutes to reach us.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, if the sun were to go out now we wouldn't know about it for eight minutes.<endOfText>
<human>You've talked about many, many galaxies and so forth.<endOfText>
<bot>What sort of distance is there involved there?<endOfText>
<human>Well, the unit that we use there is the light year, which is the distance that light can travel in one year, and the nearest stars are about a light year away.<endOfText>
<bot>The furthest galaxies are about three thousand million light years away.<endOfText>
<human>Three thousand million light years — that really is a huge distance.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Now if we try and get some idea of what this distance may correspond to, light travels at what sort of speed?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, it travels at about three hundred thousand kilometres per second, or if you prefer the normal British units, a hundred and eighty six thousand miles per second.<endOfText>
<human>A hundred and eighty six thousand miles per second.<endOfText>
<bot>What's the fastest that humans can travel?<endOfText>
<human>Oh, my goodness.<endOfText>
<bot>In miles per second that's not so easy, but humans have travelled at perhaps a few tens of miles per second in a spacecraft.<endOfText>
<human>A few tens.<endOfText>
<bot>So we're talking about seveal thousands, if not getting closer to millions, of the speed that a human being would possibly travel?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>So if we're talking about something talking about something taking a light year to reach us in terms of light, any possibility of human contact we're talking about millions of years, probably, rather than a few years.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>And that's, I think, important because it gives us some concept of how far we would have to go to get there, as it were, apart from seeing it.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, that's right.<endOfText>
<bot>It would be very difficult even to to get to the nearest start.<endOfText>
<human>It would take many thousands of years.<endOfText>
<bot>Now light, presumably erm one of the reasons one chooses a light year as a unit or a distance is because it's a convenient number, but also presumably because it doesn't change very much with any physical factor.<endOfText>
<human>I mean light is  travels at a pretty constant speed, doesn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>In fact the speed of light is now defined to be a constant.<endOfText>
<bot>So that's a good starting point.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>You've talked about fairly large distances, distances that you couldn't possibly measure with tape measures and using normal methods of measurement, how on earth do you know these distances are the kind you describe?<endOfText>
<human>That's a very good question.<endOfText>
<bot>Light itself can be used as a sort of tape measure.<endOfText>
<human>For example, for distances within the solar system, distances to the planets and to the sun, we can use radar methods.<endOfText>
<bot>I think this is probably familiar to most people.<endOfText>
<human>A radar beam is one that you send out and it bounces off the thing you're trying to measure the distance of and then the beam comes back and is picked up again and you measure the time between the beam going out and the beam coming back, and that's twice the time it takes for the beam to get to the object and back again.<endOfText>
<bot>So if you know how fast the beam is going, and that's in fact the speed of light, then you know how far away the object is, and you can do this for the planets.<endOfText>
<human>It's been done for Venus and for Mercury about twenty years ago.<endOfText>
<bot>How accurately would you be able to make these measurements?<endOfText>
<human>How confident are you that they are correct?<endOfText>
<bot>Quite remarkably accurate.<endOfText>
<human>The basic astronomical unit is, in fact, known to about one part in a million.<endOfText>
<bot>So that's radar.<endOfText>
<human>That'll get you a certain distance, but that pre-supposes you can actually bounce something back, doesn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>So what happens if you can't bounce something back?<endOfText>
<bot>Well you can't use that method, and indeed radar can't be used outside the solar system.<endOfText>
<human>The next method that is used is a method which again is familiar to people on the earth — surveyors use it all the time — and that's what we call triangulation, and the idea there is that if you look at a distant object against an even more distant background, then the apparent direction will depend on where you're standing, and if you move from one end to the other of a baseline, then a distant steeple, for example, will appear to move against the hills on the horizon.<endOfText>
<bot>But, Robert, we on earth must have a very small baseline compared with the big distances we're trying to measure?<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm just trying to give you and idea of how the method works.<endOfText>
<human>Obviously you can't use any baseline that you can actually travel on foot from one end after the other, but we can use the astronomical unit itself as a baseline because the earth is moving round the sun.<endOfText>
<bot>It goes once round the sun every year.<endOfText>
<human>That's what we mean by the year, and at opposite sides of its orbit a nearby star, for example, will appear to be in different directions relative the background of very much fainter, more distant stars, and we can use that to see how far away it is.<endOfText>
<bot>And that get us up to a certain distance, but even then that method must fail when you get beyond a certain distance.<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>That method can be used to distances of about a hundred light years.<endOfText>
<bot>Beyond that the angles involved become just too small to be measured and we have to use a quite different kind of technique which involves knowing something about the properties of the objects we're looking at.<endOfText>
<human>And we talk about standard light bulbs — the idea here is that take a terrestrial example again, suppose you're looking out at night and you see a light approaching you, if it's a cyclist with a very faint light then you'll not see him until he's quite close.<endOfText>
<bot>If it's a motorcar with very powerful headlights you'll see it very much further away.<endOfText>
<human>So we want to get bright objects that we can see at great distances, but we also need to know something about what it is we're looking at.<endOfText>
<bot>If we saw the cyclist close to and the motorist a long way away, they would look about the same.<endOfText>
<human>So the distance makes something look rather fainter, and similarly if you have something like a particular kind of start that you can identify by some property — which we'll perhaps talk about in a moment — if you can identify it and you know how bright it is, then the fainter ones are further away and you can estimate the distance by how faint they are.<endOfText>
<bot>What happens, Robert, if the stars aren't actually fixed distance, but they're actually moving, either towards us or away from us.<endOfText>
<human>Doesn't that mess up you approach?<endOfText>
<bot>It does, but the stars, although they're moving fast by terrestrial standards, are moving very slowly by comparison with the vast distances we're talking about, and they don't change their distances by very much in the time that we're watching.<endOfText>
<human>So what about the things that we occasionally hear of  colour shifts and so on— is that relevant to what we're talking about at the moment?<endOfText>
<bot>That is a way of measuring the speeds at which stars and galaxies are moving away from us.<endOfText>
<human>The effect here is similar to listening to a train whistle.<endOfText>
<bot>As the train goes past erm you get a note that goes .<endOfText>
<human>The frequency changes as the train passes and the high note is when the train is coming towards us and the low one when the train is going away, and you get the same effect with light except that instead of being high and low it's blue shifted if the object is coming towards us and red if it's going away.<endOfText>
<bot>Do we actually have blue shift stars?<endOfText>
<human>I've heard of red shifts.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes.<endOfText>
<human>We have both do we?<endOfText>
<bot>Stars near the sun have both  well some have blue shifts and some have red shifts, so they're moving in all directions relative to the sun.<endOfText>
<human>All right, now we've got pretty well way out — have we been able to reach the furthest objects in space by these methods, or are we stil stuck for a method?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, by an extension of the this standard light bulb method you can get most of the way into the universe.<endOfText>
<human>The nearby galaxies you can reach using a kind of special variable star.<endOfText>
<bot>It varies in brightness and the way that it varies picks it out.<endOfText>
<human>Its a sort of signature — you can recognise that particular kind of star — it's called a sephied variable, and we know how bright that is and so we can use that to get distances to nearby galaxies.<endOfText>
<bot>For very distant objects these stars themselves are too faint to be visible, but if you look at clusters of galaxies, we find that the very brightest galaxy in a cluster is the same brightness in all clusters and so the fainter it looks to us the further away the cluster of galaxies must be.<endOfText>
<human>And then we come to the red shift, in fact, that you were talking about a minute ago.<endOfText>
<bot>Because although stars near to us show both red shifts and blue shifts, distant galaxies show only red shifts, and that means that all the galaxies that we can see are moving away from us.<endOfText>
<human>The universe, in fact, is expanding (although that's another talk really) and for the present purpose the important thing is that they're moving away at a speed which increases with their distance and so if we can measure the speed that they're moving away from us, then we can find their distance, and that takes us to the edge of the universe.<endOfText>
<bot>Are there events taking place that we will never ever see because they're so far away, or maybe they're taking place in such a way that they're moving away faster than the light is travelling in our direction?<endOfText>
<human>No, they won't be moving away faster than light is travelling because the theory of relativity says that nothing can move faster than light, but there are certainly things which may be happening now which we shall not learn about for thousands of millions of years because they are so far away.<endOfText>
<bot>And when you look far into space, you're also looking back in time and we're looking back when we look at the very most distant objects.<endOfText>
<human>We're looking right back to the beginning of the universe.<endOfText>
<bot>And, lastly, if you went into space and you really went very fast and for a long, long time, would you ever reach an edge?<endOfText>
<human>Would you ever reach an end?<endOfText>
<bot>Would you ever reach a boundary?<endOfText>
<human>That's disputed at the moment.<endOfText>
<bot>erm I think the consensus is that you wouldn't — that either space is infinite, or at the very least it it's finite it has no edge, so if you went in one direction for long enough you would come back in the other direction.<endOfText>
<human>Robert, the mind literally boggles at those distances  mine does, anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>So does mine.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you very much.<endOfText>
<bot>I'd love to talk to you more about this, but I'm afraid that's all that we have time for today.<endOfText>
<human>Hello.<endOfText>
<bot>Peter Simpson is a chemist at the university.<endOfText>
<human>It's a long time ago since I did any chemistry.<endOfText>
<bot>It was at school, and my memories of chemistry is laboratories full of stink bombs, full of bangs, and rather unpleasant chemicals.<endOfText>
<human>Has chemistry changed very much over the years, Peter?<endOfText>
<bot>Well it's probably a good deal less smelly and bangy than once it was.<endOfText>
<human>The Health and Safety at Work Act has made us rather more concerned about smells and bangs and the dangers these cause, so perhaps life is a little bit less smelly than it was, perhaps a little less exciting, but it ought to be a little longer too.<endOfText>
<bot>On a more serious note, has chemistry changed as a subject very much over the last, dare I say, twenty five years?<endOfText>
<human>Well, yes, I think it has.<endOfText>
<bot>There have been scientific developments, of course, in chemistry, but perhaps it's seen now as being more important in the context of the contribution it's making to other important areas such as biology, environmental science and so forth .<endOfText>
<human>At school one did a certain amount of chemistry, and then at university one did what was possibly a slightly different subject.<endOfText>
<bot>Is that still true, or is the chemistry at school very similar to the chemistry that one would do at university?<endOfText>
<human>I think it's probably fairly similar, but of course it gets more sophisticated, both in terms of the intellectual level at which you talk about chemistry, the concepts and so forth, and also in terms of the sort of experiments you can do because we have such sophisticated apparatus now, which you couldn't possibly get in a school laboratory.<endOfText>
<bot>So we can do more sophisticated things experimentally and intellectually I would say.<endOfText>
<human>Now does that matter, so far as being at school is concerned, if they can't really do proper experiments does that mean to say they can't do proper chemistry?<endOfText>
<bot>I wouldn't say that they couldn't do proper experiments at school, I don't think that's right.<endOfText>
<human>It's just that we do rather more sophisticated versions sometimes of very similar things which are done at school, but they might be done more precisely, simply in a rather more sophisticated way.<endOfText>
<bot>But I am sure that if someone found they liked doing chemistry at school they're likely to find that they like continuing to do it at university, and vice versa.<endOfText>
<human>If it turns them off at school it will probably turn them off at university.<endOfText>
<bot>Taking your point that chemistry at university is a privileged subject in so far as that the equipment available is more sophisticated, more expense, more accurate, possibly, surely universities ought to be doing something to help kids in schools?<endOfText>
<human>Well, yes, that's absolutely right, and I think we've always taken it as part of our responsibilities here really that they should extend over towards students in schools as well as students here at the university, and we do of course do quite a lot, in various ways, across the science area, to contribute towards science in schools.<endOfText>
<bot>Tell me some of the things that we do.<endOfText>
<human>Well the science area as a whole has a number of activities.<endOfText>
<bot>For example, we organise an annual school science lecture.<endOfText>
<human>This takes place in late November and on two separate evenings we fill our largest lecture theatre with local school children from both sides of the county, sometimes a little bit further afield, and that means that we're giving them an illustrated lecture by one of our more distinguished colleagues, and we entertain and inform, I think, something like eight hundred school children every year in that alone.<endOfText>
<bot>And that's something that possibly the public don't know about.<endOfText>
<human>Wel it doesn't get a great deal of publicity in the media, and of course we only circulate information about it to schools, so I'm sure that the man in the street probably has never heard of it.<endOfText>
<bot>What sort of subjects will we tackle at these November lectures?<endOfText>
<human>Well we try to span right over the range of science.<endOfText>
<bot>We've had lectures in the biology area, in physics, in engineering and in chemistry, so that we've really spanned the whole shooting match really as far as that goes, and of course we try to put something into these lectures for those doing the most advanced work in the sixth form and also for those doing O levels, let's say, and some who are younger even than that.<endOfText>
<human>We try in other words to hit a variety of targets of different ages, right across the spectrum.<endOfText>
<bot>That's one big lecture in the year.<endOfText>
<human>Are there occasions when there are other opportunities for kids to meet university people, perhaps hear them speak about their subjects?<endOfText>
<bot>Well again the science area as a whole puts out a very large list of lecture titles, which it is prepared to deliver in schools.<endOfText>
<human>Now this is very much a voluntary activity on the part of those who give the lectures, but neverthless we have an extremely large list, right across the science area, of lecture titles and lecturers, people who are prepared to go out and do this in schools, and of course they get an opportunity to meet teachers and students in schools in this way.<endOfText>
<bot>You talk about a large list erm how many possible lectures are there on the list?<endOfText>
<human>Oh, I should say of the four science schools on average we've got maybe thirty or forty titles from each, so that's about  well certainly well over a hundred titles altogether.<endOfText>
<bot>And how many schools avail themselves of this opportunity each year?<endOfText>
<human>It's a little bit variable, I think, from our own science school — one science school to another — and from year to year, but I would say maybe twenty or thirty for each science school.<endOfText>
<bot>And any school can get a lecturer to come out, subject to availability of course, to give one of these?<endOfText>
<human>Well we generally aim to have  I suppose most of our lectures at an A level standard, but we have a significant number for those doing O level, indeed some lectures which can be tailored for either, so anybody very mucg below O level we probably couldn't cater for — I think probably because we wouldn't feel competent, rather than because we don't want to do it.<endOfText>
<bot>So some of the lectures are actually aimed at A level students.<endOfText>
<human>Certainly, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Others at O level students.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>And some could be given at either level?<endOfText>
<human>Well they might be tailored a little bit according to the level, but basically it's a similar lecture.<endOfText>
<bot>Do they come with demonstrations?<endOfText>
<human>Usually this is so, but of course the lecturers they are very different in their approaches — some will use this illustration approach more than others.<endOfText>
<bot>And if there are any teachers that want to know about this, they could get details by contacting you, Peter Simpson, at the university?<endOfText>
<human>They could indeed, yes, at the School of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences.<endOfText>
<bot>Good.<endOfText>
<human>Now that's lecturing, what other contacts do we have with schools?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, as a chemist perhaps you'll forgive me for dwelling largely on what we as chemists do, but of course it's not only the chemists in the School of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences who do things for schools — it's right across the area — but each year, for example, we have a week set aside for sixth form visits, in which parties of sixth formers come to the School and we're about to talk to them about university entrance, about what goes on in universities, but, most importantly, to show them some of the apparatus which they don't have at school but which they've probably heard about.<endOfText>
<human>I think we've settled down to a pattern of events now which schools have actually indicated to us is what they want to see.<endOfText>
<bot>And what time of the year does this happen?<endOfText>
<human>This is in the summer.<endOfText>
<bot>This year I think it's the first week in July we have set aside for this purpose.<endOfText>
<human>And again arrangements are made between schools and the university to accommodate groups of children, or <endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>We send out details to the schools each year, and they will book to bring a party of children round for, oh it lasts about two and a half hours altogether, and they will come either for a morning or for an afternoon.<endOfText>
<bot>We in physics have two or three opportunities for sixth formers, fifth formers to come to the university and find out a little bit more about physics.<endOfText>
<human>We run a lower sixth form residential summer school for kids, which has been very popular for the past five years.<endOfText>
<bot>We also run a summer school called Women into Physics, which is a rather strange title, but the idea basically is to persuade, if not encourage, young girls who have just taken their O levels that physics is a subject which could be for them — it's not unladylike about being a scientist and, in particular, being a physicist.<endOfText>
<human>Do you do anything like this in chemistry, Peter.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, not quite like this.<endOfText>
<human>I think this merely emphasises that each school is operating its own erm thing, as it were.<endOfText>
<bot>But I must say I'm very encouraged to see the numbers of women who are applying to do subjects like chemistry and physics is going up and certainly we would applaud that sort of activity.<endOfText>
<human>I think as chemists we would be glad to see more and more women come into the subject.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you think that there is a disadvantage to being a woman at school, so far as a science subject's concerned?<endOfText>
<human>Do you think that teachers really don't expect them to do well in the sciences and perhaps even positively discourage them from going into science?<endOfText>
<bot>I doubt whether this is done deliberately, but I think it's part of everybody's perception of science in schools that girls do biology and boys do chemistry and physics, and I suppose this is bound to have its affect on people's choices, but I personally, and I think most of my colleagues would agree with me on this, see no reason to suppose that girls should be any less good at chemistry and physics than boys.<endOfText>
<human>Are they at any form of disadvantage when they come to university studying a science subject such as chemistry?<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think so.<endOfText>
<human>I don't think so at all.<endOfText>
<bot>It's interesting, actually, since I teach a first year class of biologists, where we do have rather more girls than boys, that erm as a class it works very well, possibly better than some of our own chemistry classes where there are fewer girls, and I don't know whether this is because of the mix or not.<endOfText>
<human>And certainly if they come for interview, if they apply to the university, they get a very good chance of entrance.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh certainly, yes, there's no question of discriminating against women.<endOfText>
<human>We're looking for good candidates whether they're men or women.<endOfText>
<bot>Peter, the things we're talking about are highly commendable, but I suspect at the back of the minds of most kids at school the question of examinations — whether they're going to get their O level, or their A level, or their G C E or whatever — to what extent are university people involved in examining?<endOfText>
<human>Well we're involved in actual fact to quite a heavy extent.<endOfText>
<bot>Within our own School two of us are actually senior examiners for one examining board and this brings us into contact with teachers and indeed candidates.<endOfText>
<human>It helps a great deal to keep us in touch with what's happening at school and enables us to exert some influence, I suppose, on what happens in schools, hopefully in the interests of the candidates.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you find a resistance to change in schools in terms of the examination syllabus and content?<endOfText>
<human>I think possibly the reverse.<endOfText>
<bot>There have been an enormous series of changes over the last ten or fifteen years, and maybe some school teachers would be glad if it slowed down a little bit to make their life a little easier, I don't know.<endOfText>
<human>Sir Keith Joseph has recently gone on record as saying that he wished that examiners could be more objective in their assessment of what children know.<endOfText>
<bot>Is there any application of this in chemistry that you can see?<endOfText>
<human>Is there a body of chemistry that, if you knew it, you're all right, as it were , you could pass a certain exam and if you didn't know it, or is chemistry a little bit subjective in terms of its assessment?<endOfText>
<bot>Well there's an element of subjectiveness, inevitably, in an assessment, I think, but of course we are aware of this problem and we do try to be a objective as we possibly can.<endOfText>
<human>We try to set ourselves specific aims and objectives and when it comes to marking scripts, for example, we have a quite specific mark scheme which has been very carefully thrased out, not only with examiners, but with certain school teachers, which we try to make tie this down as be as objective as we can, but there's always and element of subjectivity.<endOfText>
<bot>If there are four marks for a given point, the candidate who gets it all right gets four, the candidate who gets it all wrong gets nothing, but the chap who gets it part right has a possibility of one, two or three, and it's often a question of judgement as to what an imperfect answer is worth.<endOfText>
<human>Do you use multiple choice papers in examinations these days?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, most Boards do, I think, but to varying extents.<endOfText>
<human>I think probably something like twenty per cent of the marks for most Boards will go on the multiple choice erm paper.<endOfText>
<bot>We use multiple choice question papers in physics too.<endOfText>
<human>I'm always a little bit worried about them because it seems to me that they almost define the syllabus in terms of what you can ask four reasonable questions in terms of alternatives about.<endOfText>
<bot>Well I wouldn't like to see an exam system which was entirely multiple choice questions for just that reason.<endOfText>
<human>I would also like to see skills of writing and arguing developed and tested.<endOfText>
<bot>But they are particularly easy to mark, but I suspect they give us a false sense of objectivity and I think we sometimes give the statistics a little bit too much weight.<endOfText>
<human>Lastly, in terms of chemistry as a career, is it a good career these days, Peter?<endOfText>
<bot>Well my feeling is that students who graduate from here ultimately get jobs.<endOfText>
<human>Many of them, of course, not in chemistry.<endOfText>
<bot>There are fewer jobs in chemistry than there used to be.<endOfText>
<human>In an economic upturn that may change, of course, but I think they all get jobs of some sort, and I would have hoped that a chemistry degree, a good training in chemistry, would in fact also train people to think in such a way that they could apply it to a lot of other areas.<endOfText>
<bot>Chemists have traditionally taken employment in other areas anyway.<endOfText>
<human>Lots of chemists have made very good chartered accountants, for example, but I would like to see very many more — let's say science trained people going out into the professions, particularly into politics.<endOfText>
<bot>So it's a training for life, not just a training for being a chemist?<endOfText>
<human>I would like to think so.<endOfText>
<bot>Peter, thank you very much.<endOfText>
<human>That's all that we have time for today.<endOfText>
<bot>Next<endOfText>
<human>Hello.<endOfText>
<bot>In our series about computers we're looking at applications in all sorts of different areas, and today we're going to talk about how they're used in medicine.<endOfText>
<human>Would you tell your symptoms to an electronic box?<endOfText>
<bot>I recently asked Dr Jim Hunter whether in the future diagnosis would be by computer rather than by doctor.<endOfText>
<human>Yes and no I suppose.<endOfText>
<bot>I think we're taking first faltering steps in this direction at the moment.<endOfText>
<human>Is a computer better than a doctor?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, the studies that I've been involved in, the computer has performed certainly as well as a consultant, and at times much better than a junior doctor in the particular situation that I'm talking about.<endOfText>
<human>It sounds to me as if it could be a bit worrying to think that when you went to see your doctor you'd be faced by a machine instead of a human being the other side of desk.<endOfText>
<bot>Well there are two answers to that I suppose.<endOfText>
<human>One is that we're certainly nowhere near that.<endOfText>
<bot>All of the uses that I know of diagnostic computers are  involve the doctor talking to the patient, looking at the patient, taking symptoms and then going and using the computer in a similar way that we perhaps might go and ask for an x-ray.<endOfText>
<human>The other answer is that erm certainly some trials have been done with patients not being diagnosed by a computer, but by giving initial information like their age, their date of birth, erm where the pain is, etc. erm actually interacting themselves with the computer, and studies have shown curiously that patients actually prefer to use a computer rather than to give this information to a doctor.<endOfText>
<bot>Now why this should be, I don't know.<endOfText>
<human>Whether it's because they feel they're not taking up the valuable time of a doctor, they can go at their own pace, who knows?<endOfText>
<bot>But certainly it may even be that people might, in the future, even prefer to talk to computers under some circumstances.<endOfText>
<human>That sounds absolutely fascinating.<endOfText>
<bot>I suppose one advantage of a computer is that it can store and remember a great deal of information.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>The  if I can talk perhaps a little bit about the particular system that I'm interested in, the way it works is that it  well it diagnoses abdominal pain; if you go into the erm particular casualty department — in the fact the Royal Sussex County Hospital at the moment — with back pain in your abdomen, lower abdomen, then the symptoms will be taken by a doctor and he will then go to the diagnostic computer and feed these symptoms in.<endOfText>
<human>These cover a large range of things, like the patient's age, the patient's sex, where the pain is, where it started, how quickly it came on, and so on and so forth, and essentially within the computer has a large table, and this table contains, how shall I put it, the frequency with which this particular symptom was associated with a particular disease over the last few hundred patients that have been seen at that hospital.<endOfText>
<bot>It's very limited.<endOfText>
<human>It only deals with the acute abdomen.<endOfText>
<bot>It deals with pains like appendicitis, coley cystitis, which is inflammation of the gall bladder — about nine different diseases — and it merely says to you at the end of the operation based on the last five or six hundred patients I've seen, the probability of this patient having appendicitis is ninety per cent, the probability of something else being ten per cent .<endOfText>
<human>So, yes, it has a big database of about oh three thousand numbers, and it just looks these up essentially.<endOfText>
<bot>So it could be used as a preliminary check for patients, more or less on a routine basis?<endOfText>
<human>Before the doctors or the consultant actually sees a patient, then <endOfText>
<bot>Well not before the doctor sees the patient, because much of the information that is fed in would have to be gain, acquired, by somebody with a good deal of medical knowledge.<endOfText>
<human>When I say ‘Where is the pain?’ and questions like this, this could be answered just by asking the patient, but there are erm various kinds of tests — one lovely test called Murphy's test, for example— which have to be carried out by a qualified doctor or a qualified medical person, so it's not a question of must being hooked onto the computer and the computer giving the answer.<endOfText>
<bot>It's an aid to the doctor for making diagnoses, not a diagnostic instrument in itself.<endOfText>
<human>Is there anything special about this sort of computer?<endOfText>
<bot>Is it an ordinary digital computer of the sort that's used in commerce and industry, or is it a special type of computer.<endOfText>
<human>Is it the program or is it the computer that's specific?<endOfText>
<bot>It's the program that's very specific to this problem.<endOfText>
<human>erm the one at the Royal Sussex is perhaps interesting, in that in fact it's  the computer is based on a microprocessor, so it really is using the latest erm in advanced microtechnology.<endOfText>
<bot>The computer itself is a box, oh what, a foot and a half by a foot by two feet, very small.<endOfText>
<human>erm but it's the program, yes, it's the application of complex programs to thee very sophisticated but very small computers, I think, which is of interest in this particular case.<endOfText>
<bot>mhm And how many places in this country are computers actually used in diagnosis?<endOfText>
<human>Oh, there you have me.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know in general.<endOfText>
<human>This particular system erm for diagnosing the acute abdomen, acute abdominal pain, we got the basic ideal from a hospital in Edinburgh.<endOfText>
<bot>They in turn got it from a hospital in Leeds, and I know of one other implementation in Sheffield of this particular system, so there may be two or three others that I don't know about, perhaps four or five in this country, of this particular type.<endOfText>
<human>erm of more general types, I really don't know.<endOfText>
<bot>Not very many.<endOfText>
<human>Is it used much more in the United States where medicine is much more expensive altogether?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, certainly, the erm place where such diagnostic systems came from, I think, was certainly the States, and most research has been done there — Stanford in particular has been very much involved in this so-called expert system.<endOfText>
<human>You do this research in collaboration with the Royal Sussex Hospital.<endOfText>
<bot>Is that where the idea came from originally?<endOfText>
<human>The original idea came from a Doctor Dedombar in Leeds.<endOfText>
<bot>This  his system was implemented in one or two places, including Edinburgh, and our current ideas essentially came from Edinburgh, from Bangor Hospital near Edinburgh.<endOfText>
<human>The consultant down here who got interested is a Mr Philip Somerville, who's a senior consultant at the Royal Sussex.<endOfText>
<bot>He visited Edinburgh, saw what they were doing there, liked it and decided to see whether it could be done at Sussex and approached the university through the Bi-Medical Engineering Group, of which I'm a member, and I was interested.<endOfText>
<human>We did a lot of talking, of course, and then it was decided that we could possibly raise some money by going to the League of Friends, which we did, and they very generously provided  well in fact the whole total is about five thousand pounds, of which three and a half thousands represents the computer, and we're about to go live, as it were , in a week or two.<endOfText>
<bot>So far we've only had particular doctors using it to run it in, as it were, but in the very near future we hope that all of the doctors in the accident department will be using this system.<endOfText>
<human>Do you have a medical background at all?<endOfText>
<bot>None whatsoever.<endOfText>
<human>So you do have to rely very heavily on collaboration with the local doctors?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh indeed.<endOfText>
<human>This is one very good aspect of such projects, I think, that the interesting work is to be done at the interface between one discipline — medicine in this case  and another discipline — computer science — where both people just have to learn to talk to each other in their own language.<endOfText>
<bot>That's part of the problem in doing such research, certainly.<endOfText>
<human>Do you think that it could ever be true that they would be sufficiently inexpensive that they could be used in most doctors' surgeries, or is it going to be something which is only used in one or two important hospitals?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh no.<endOfText>
<human>I think expense certainly won't be a problem.<endOfText>
<bot>I can very well see such prices going down and down and down  well certainly to several hundred pounds.<endOfText>
<human>In particular, if one started to make such systems much more, how shall I put it,tailor the electronics to the purpose, then the cost could be quite low.<endOfText>
<bot>At the moment we're dealing with a general purpose system, which is designed for all sorts of applications, and one pays for having a thing general purpose by costing more money.<endOfText>
<human>Certainly it's feasible to have them in G Ps surgeries.<endOfText>
<bot>I would, myself, be very keen to look at the possibility of such machines perhaps even going to third world countries, because it's even arguable that the place for such intelligence systems is not to replace expert medical people in this country where we have such people, but to export them to developing countries which don't have such people, and one could imagine, perhaps, a system of erm paramedical orderlies, who had some sort of medical knowledge and manipulative skill, taking a small expert computer in a shoe box — it would be no bigger — to villages and getting diagnoses of patient illnesses there on the spot.<endOfText>
<human>So it would make a great deal of difference in areas where there's very little available in the way of medical services.<endOfText>
<bot>What's the future, then?<endOfText>
<human>You've worked out a program or a system for acute erm stomach pains — are you planning to move onto other areas and gradually build up a catalogue of aches and pains in the body, or what?<endOfText>
<bot>Well this particular system that I'm working on a the moment is really unintelligent.<endOfText>
<human>It, as I said earlier, really just looks up a table of data values, numerical values, and comes up with an answer and you can't question it, you can't ask it why did you get that particular answer.<endOfText>
<bot>erm it doesn't give an answer, but if you could the only answer it could give is that what my tables say is wrong.<endOfText>
<human>Now there is a class of systems, so-called expert systems, which have come out of artificial intelligence research, which can do much more than that, are much more intelligent.<endOfText>
<bot>Internally, they mirror the structure of an expert's thought, in this case of a doctor's thoughts, which tends to be much more.<endOfText>
<human>If I see this and if I see that, then that means something else, and that something else taken in conjunction with something else that I see might suggest so and so, and so on.<endOfText>
<bot>This is the way that people think, people reason.<endOfText>
<human>This isn't the way that the current system reasons, and I would certainly like to take the current system and push it in this direction of being more expert in a human sense.<endOfText>
<bot>I think one of the great areas of such as system is in teaching young doctors, in training people, and an expert who can't tell a tutee why he has given a certain answer isn't really much good as a teacher.<endOfText>
<human>I think to be a good teaching aid something has to say ‘Well I think this because’ and, as it were, retrace the chain of reasoning that I've just  the sort of chain that I've given you.<endOfText>
<bot>So that, I think, is where this research ought to go, into truly expert systems rather than in statistical machines, which is what it is at the moment.<endOfText>
<human>So what you would see is the machine, as it were, engaging the patient in a much more perhaps conversational mode and with much more feedback and response to the way in which the patient is answering the questions or behaving, rather than just, as it were , a machine which elicits information from the patient and compares it with a statistical set of data.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, whether one would ever actually get such a system interacting with a patient is difficult to foresee.<endOfText>
<human>It's possible, I suppose, but I think a lot of research has to be done on the way interaction takes place.<endOfText>
<bot>I think we've got to work out better ways of machines interacting with doctors, perhaps before we're ready to move on to machines interacting with patients.<endOfText>
<human>Well that sounds absolutely fascinating.<endOfText>
<bot>I believe there's one other area in which you're working, and that is putting computers together to simulate visual interpretation of some kind.<endOfText>
<human>Is that so?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>erm this is a more abstract research project, which is concerned with the idea that we may, very soon perhaps, reach the limit of what we can cram onto a silicon chip.<endOfText>
<bot>That being so, the only way to get more computing power to attack any given problem — and the sort of problems I'm interested in are very complex problems — the only way to get enough computing power to tackle these may be to make a number of computers work together in co-operation; what we call multiprocessor systems or, since we're interested in microprocessors, small computers, we talk about multimicroprocessor systems.<endOfText>
<human>A particular research project that I and two colleagues, Keith Baker and Erin Sloman, have a grant from the Science Research Council for is to look first of all at the problems of getting such as system with, well at the moment three but possibly up to twelve computers, working on a given existing artificial intelligence problem to see how to take this big program — it's called Popeye — it's a research project to study various areas of visual perception, as you say — to see how to break this down and have it running simultaneously on a number of much smaller computers, rather than on the single big computer that it's running on at the moment.<endOfText>
<bot>The second half of the project is concerned really with how on earth we get such program to work, such programs are very complicated, they interact in various odd ways, and getting the bugs out, getting the problems out or debugging as the jargon has it, is a really serious problem and we hope to make some advance on the problem of erm developing programs for such distributed multi-processor systems.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you very much, Jim, for talking about this research.<endOfText>
<bot>however, we're going to examine quite a different area  how computer can help librarians to make better use of their stock.<endOfText>
<human>Peter Stone is a librarian at the university.<endOfText>
<bot>Peter, how useful have you found the computer in our library?<endOfText>
<human>Well, first of all I suppose one should say that we don't just use one computer, we, like lots of other libraries, have got access to a large number of computers, and indeed you'll find these computers being used elsewhere for the same sort of work.<endOfText>
<bot>Probably most people have seen displays of Prestel, even in television rental shops, which is a system running through the Post Office network, accessing large amounts of mainly factual information — things like telephone directories, like timetables, like oh a lot of business information.<endOfText>
<human>That's very effective if you're dealing with factual information which is changing fairly rapidly, and I think we'll see quite a growth of that in the next few years, but libraries aren't just stores of factual information, they store a large number of books and articles and they need access to that too, and probably the most typical external use of a computer in libraries  in a university library, or academic library, these days is to access the huge stores of information on scientific publishing.<endOfText>
<bot>There's one gigantic computer in California, which has got access to a hundred databases there called the stores of information, compiled mainly by the publishers of journals.<endOfText>
<human>It's got thirty million articles in it and you can find information, pull out articles relevant to your needs by looking for authors, looking for words in the text, and you can look at the summary of the article very quickly.<endOfText>
<bot>In both Prestel and those sorts of things as you use the system you pay, and you pay for the telecommunications cost, you pay for the computer cost and you pay for the information that you receive, and that sort of worthwhile sharing of information, I am sure, is going to grow.<endOfText>
<human>However, my own interest, perhaps, is more in what a library, a typical library — not just a university library  can do with its own computer, and most of our readers, most of the people who use libraries, expect to find books in those libraries and expect to find them when they want them, and our interests have been angled very much towards improving that sort of service.<endOfText>
<bot>So there's a sense in which you use a computer for all sorts of different purposes.<endOfText>
<human>You use a computer when books are issued, for example?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>I'm sure most people by now are quite familiar with the use of computers in this way.<endOfText>
<bot>In fact, in about 1971 there was a sudden spate of development in this area, and both the university library and what was then Brighton Public Library, and West Sussex, all were innovators in those days, using computer-based lending systems, which used little cards with lots of little holes in them, and I am sure they are familiar to lots of people.<endOfText>
<human>In the last few years you'll have seen those holes replaced by sort of zebra stripes — what we call bar codes in the trade, and those bar codes you'll also see on your groceries all over the place.<endOfText>
<bot>That's an interesting problem, the way we communicate to a computer is not the way we necessarily think of it.<endOfText>
<human>You can only distinguish your library card from that of a book by a difference in the thickness of one line.<endOfText>
<bot>It's just a thick line for humans and a thin line for books, possibly, but it works and we haven't had any problems.<endOfText>
<human>So when you are actually checking out a book the librarian runs a little light pen, is it, over the code, so that it <endOfText>
<bot>That's it.<endOfText>
<human>Well there again there's a compromise.<endOfText>
<bot>We all know how to use pens, we were taught how to use pen in primary school, but the computer can't read our writing yet, so we use something which looks like a pen, but is reading something which doesn't look like letters of the alphabet and words, but which it can understand and understand very quickly and very accurately indeed.<endOfText>
<human>And presumably the advantage of using a computer for that is much greater than the mere erm saving of time in a librarian taking out a card and putting it in a wallet or a card folder or something like that, because you can retain in your computer a lot of information about what books are in the library and what books are out with lenders and so on.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>That information is only part of the very large store of information that we need to retain in our own local computer, which contains records about, oh it's about a hundred and fifty thousand of our four hundred and fifty thousand different books at this moment.<endOfText>
<bot>Going back on what I said earlier on, East Sussex County Library, for example, keep their records of books, their catalogue, on a system which is run from the British Library, and the Polytechnic draws that sort of information from a co-operative which was originally based in Birmingham.<endOfText>
<human>We've chosen to go it alone, but the net result is the same, that the computer store of information includes information on the authors and the titles of the books and, of course, now includes information on the books that are being borrowed, who's got them, when they're coming back, how many other copies we've got, whether we've got copies on order, and all of that, all in one central store of information, a central store which can be shared by everyone using the library.<endOfText>
<bot>mhm And I suppose in the old days if you actually wanted to know which books were popular and which books were not used at all you had to send a librarian to painstakingly look through the shelves, perhaps, and look at the date stamps or something like that, whereas now it's presumably just a question of pressing a few buttons and the information comes.<endOfText>
<human>Well right.<endOfText>
<bot>In the old days we simply couldn't afford to do that.<endOfText>
<human>We're not dealing with a thousand items, we're dealing with four hundred and fifty thousand items, and for anyone to go and collect that information on a larger scale  even sampling it would have been almost unthinkable.<endOfText>
<bot>Now the computer can collect this sort of information as people borrow the books, as a sort of by-product if you like.<endOfText>
<human>The book is lent, it needs to be known when it's gone out, when it's due back, but the computer can clock up one.<endOfText>
<bot>That bit of information adds to other bits of information, all within the central store.<endOfText>
<human>We know what the price of the book was.<endOfText>
<bot>We had to pay for it, so we had to send off a bill and therefore it knows what the price is.<endOfText>
<human>We have to put a shelf mark on the book so that we can shelve the book, but that tells us quite a lot about the subject.<endOfText>
<bot>And if you start putting those three things together, the Librarian, as manager of his library, can start to put all this information together.<endOfText>
<human>In fact the computer digests it for him to give him and overview of how effective his operation is, when he should be buying extra copies, when perhaps he should be thinking of not buying quite so much, or being a little more selective.<endOfText>
<bot>But the reader gains as well because he sees it from a different angle.<endOfText>
<human>Most of our users come into the library looking for a very specific book.<endOfText>
<bot>About eighty per cent of the users are students, and they've normally been told to read this, or read that, or read the other and if they now use one of our computer terminals, which has got a little video screen on the top and a little keyboard, they can look up the books.<endOfText>
<human>They can look the up by title, by the title of the book, as well as by the traditional author approach, and when they've found it the computer tells them how many copies are in the library or whether or they're all on loan.<endOfText>
<bot>It's all drawing information from this same central store of information.<endOfText>
<human>It's a way of sharing information amongst a lot of different people for a lot of different reasons, information which previously would have been separated and almost impossible to put together without a great deal of effort.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's hark back to what you were saying earlier about information storage on a very large scale.<endOfText>
<human>You mentioned the explosion of information, particularly in the science area where there are thousands, literally thousands, of publications and scientists producing more information, more data every day and pumping into these things.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you think it's going to ultimately change the whole notion of publishing?<endOfText>
<human>Do you think that perhaps in due course publishing will move into an area in which you wouldn't ever actually print anything, you would actually put it into a machine.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Well it's very interesting, but I'm not sure it's working in the same direction as almost implied by your question of implying that there was almost too much.<endOfText>
<bot>One of the more fascinating changes has been the introduction of word processing equipment, whereby someone who types his article can just sent off something like a floppy disk to his publisher, and without much intervention it appears as the printed article.<endOfText>
<human>The publisher, traditionally, needs to sell at least a thousand copies of that to be worth even advertising it, but this means that you can print an extra copy whenever you want and this then implies and even larger and larger growth in more and more specialised information which only computers can manage, and one hesitates to work out where the end of all this is.<endOfText>
<bot>The human race is producing so much information.<endOfText>
<human>It isn't factual information, we're not just looking at price movements of stocks and shares, but in the scientific community it's very much to do with ideas and how that person can get across his ideas, his concepts, to people half a world away.<endOfText>
<bot>That's a very complicated question.<endOfText>
<human>And you mentioned then how a floppy disk, that's a sort of disk storage device, can be used to get a book printed.<endOfText>
<bot>Is this being used at all in practice, or is it just a daydream?<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes, indeed, a close friend of mine has been working on a history of a very large British company and he's just seen the proofs produced from the printers from the typescript which was typed in his own office, and apart from the fact that their computers can change the typefaces and improve the whole thing, the work has not had to be rekeyboarded, as they would say, retyped in, at all.<endOfText>
<bot>It does save things very considerably.<endOfText>
<human>It's part of this way in which the computer can turn information over and over again for a different need.<endOfText>
<bot>I saw in publishing a very nice example of that — not the word processing — but at John Wylies, who are very big scientific publishers in Chichester, where they had a computer system which the editor — he's the person who deals with the author, puts the book together — set about ordering the book, the orders and that information went into the computer, when the thing was printed it went into the warehouse and the computer then organised the storage of all of these things in the warehouse.<endOfText>
<human>Orders came in, and that helped the warehouse unpack the boxes and despatch them.<endOfText>
<bot>The information got fed back to the editor to tell him what the sales were.<endOfText>
<human>It was a continuous process, and all of the people tended to see the computer as working very much for them rather than for the other department next door.<endOfText>
<bot>And presumably if you wanted to revise a book at all and you had the book on your floppy disk or in your computer in some form, you could again use your word processor to bring it up to date in a revised version?<endOfText>
<human>Well that is  I think everyone who's ever worked on computers, editing or word processing, has been very fascinated by the change of attitude that they've had, that somehow it isn't finished, it's never finished.<endOfText>
<bot>Previously you could ask someone to type up first draft, second draft, maybe a third draft, but how far can you drive your secretary — and now they can be wholly in charge of this.<endOfText>
<human>They can change the layout of it as much as the words within it.<endOfText>
<bot>They can ask colleagues to come in and comment and you can add a little bit.<endOfText>
<human>Could you revise paragraph ten, Fred?<endOfText>
<bot>That sort of thing goes on continuously.<endOfText>
<human>The thing is moulded under your eyes, and a recent book which has been very popular in the university Gödel Esher Bach which is on some of the aspects of artificial intelligence and ideas, has in its preface got quite a long article on how the author actually organised all of the processes, right through to the final printing of that book, and indeed even wrote the programs for formatting the text, and it has obviously been very stimulating for him.<endOfText>
<bot>He could organise the final output of everything that he had thought right from beginning through to end.<endOfText>
<human>Well thank you very much, Peter, that most interesting.<endOfText>
<bot>That's all that we have time for today.<endOfText>
<human>Hello.<endOfText>
<bot>In our Ideas in Action programme I shall be talking to Dr Mike King about teaching science to very young children in schools.<endOfText>
<human>I shall be asking him questions such as‘Is it a good idea for parents to encourage their children to become interested in science by buying them toys, such as a chemistry sets, for Christmas’.<endOfText>
<bot>Well they're a lot of fun and kids love them, and as I commented a little earlier to somebody I still haven't quite forgiven my mother-in-law for the chemistry set she bought my seven year old.<endOfText>
<human>He is absolutely amazed by it and spends lots of time in the garage and the back, which actually means that I spend an awful lot  of time in that garage in the cold too.<endOfText>
<bot>There is an exhibition of science carried out by children in first schools in Brighton and Hove at the Booth Museum, Dyke Road, this week.<endOfText>
<human>It's open to the public on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.<endOfText>
<bot>Hello.<endOfText>
<human>Science is thought of as a subject that is difficult both to teach and to learn.<endOfText>
<bot>The folklore in school terms is that you have to be a relatively ancient teenager to appreciate physics and chemistry and biology.<endOfText>
<human>Is this true?<endOfText>
<bot>Today I have with me Dr Mike King, who's made a study of science teaching in schools.<endOfText>
<human>Mike, how early can science be taught to children?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I think that rather depends on saying fairly concisely what it is we mean by science.<endOfText>
<human>If in a sense it means how early can you teach children facts and contents and very straightforward knowledge, then I think the answer is not very early at all because it may be fairly meaningless that you could teach a child to repeat Newton's law, perhaps the same way as you could teach him to repeat the eleven times table, but without a good concept of number or what Newton meant.<endOfText>
<bot>It's probably something they could learn off parrot fashion, but doesn't have any actual meaning for them.<endOfText>
<human>But if you look at science as a way of exploring their world, a world they can structure their curiosity about aspects of the physical world, about aspects of the environment, then I think we can do it very early indeed, probably from the time children can come to school at the age of five and from reception classes onwards.<endOfText>
<bot>In fact, we do run a project which looks at the ways science can be taught in the first school, which has been very surprising to me and many of my colleagues by what can actually be done with children in the ages of five to seven.<endOfText>
<human>For most young children in that age group, the world's a magic place and we traditionally like to teach them nature study and flowers and cuddly hamsters and rabbits in school, and that's the nature table syndrome, and that's great and I'm not knocking that at all.<endOfText>
<bot>There is so much opportunity for children to look at the nature of the physical world around them which isn't taken advantage of, and which could be, and I think that may have something to do with the attitude of teachers as much as the attitude of children.<endOfText>
<human>But erm they're tremendously curious about the nature of the world around them and they're certainly capable of, if not understanding why, exploring what.<endOfText>
<bot>I took my godson, Dominic Robinson, round my laboratory the other day, which is a physics laboratory, and he enjoyed it immensely and asked a number of questions, and was absolutely intrigued and fascinated by the various bits of wires and plugs and so on like that, and he asked me the sort of questions that I don't think I would expect sometimes my  undergraduates to ask.<endOfText>
<human>They were perhaps stemmed from innocence, but they were very searching and very real questions, and he was obviously very excited to ask them and to listen to some of the answers.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you think we perhaps put kids off an interest in science by our sort of insistence that they have to have a solid understanding of Newton's laws and all sorts of principles, and we lose the magic too early?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I'm sure we do, and I think that's to do with our notions of what science is.<endOfText>
<bot>There's a mystique which has built up about it.<endOfText>
<human>Anybody who's worked in graduate or postgraduate level in science likes almost to continue that mystique.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, we do put children off by being rigid because a child, I am sure, doesn't see the world in a rigid way.<endOfText>
<human>What's out there is all out there.<endOfText>
<bot>Bits of his universe are to do with art and colour and drawing.<endOfText>
<human>I mean if you watch a child, and I have a seven year old boy, playing stacking cards or dominoes is the current thing in our house, watching them stack them and then knocking them off and watching them fall and the way they fall, the amount of work which is involved there in structures and forces and the nature of gravity and the way things behave under gravity fascinate them.<endOfText>
<bot>The problem, of course, is most of us couldn't give a sensible reply to the very searching questions they ask, so we tend to say something like ‘that's a fascinating questions, but you'll have to wait till you're older and ask a scientist’.<endOfText>
<human>That's not the children's mistake, that's ours, because we couldn't actually for the best part respond in a meaningful way.<endOfText>
<bot>And in another sense what we don't do often is to actually recognize the significance of the child's question because of the language he puts it in.<endOfText>
<human>He asks something which, you know, I mean the way they do, what is life, and you wouldn't know — unless you're perhaps trained or awake to the significance of what the child is actually asking — you wouldn't know how to respond to that, so you tend to put it off.<endOfText>
<bot>You mentioned that schools are quite good at biology, that they have guinea pigs and they have growing plants and so forth, and I think you hinted at the fact that they perhaps are not quite so good at maybe the harder sciences, we might  call them, of physics and chemistry.<endOfText>
<human>Is that the case and, if so, what can we do about it at an early stage?<endOfText>
<bot>I believe that is the case, and I believe that again is a reflection of us as adults erm and not an indictment of teachers.<endOfText>
<human>They show great pedagogic skills in almost every aspect of school life.<endOfText>
<bot>Most of us, as people who live in this world, are interested in our environment, and even if not young we certainly grow to appreciate it and to learn a bit about flowers and the way animals live and work in our garden and watching David Attenborough on television and erm we have a genuine interest because as part of this world we know it and come to understand it, and probably feel, therefore, if even if you're not a biology specialist, which you certainly don't have to be by any means, when a child asks a question about, you know, ‘where do the flies go in winter?’ and ‘why's the hamster gone to sleep for three months?’we feel more capable of answering it because we're closer to it ourselves and those are the sorts of questions that people told us.<endOfText>
<human>When a child asks a question about something dropping from a height — does it get faster and it falls for longer and longer?— that probably is a question that most teachers who are not trained in the physical sciences just cannot answer.<endOfText>
<bot>What can we do about it?<endOfText>
<human>I think at the end it must come down to two things; one basically a change in attitude — we have to come to recognise that we live in a very, very technological society, that most of us were born before man walked on the moon, but the kids in school were born in an age when man had walked on the moon ten years ago and they live in a world which is very scientific, and we have to recognise that — and the other one is practical sense, I think, where we really have to look seriously to in-service training of teachers, a) and b) we have to look carefully at the way we train teachers now.<endOfText>
<bot>In many institutions which train primary and first school teachers, the teachers themselves have an option as to whether they can do a science course or not and then even if they do it it's usually very biologically biased erm towards the natural sciences.<endOfText>
<human>At Sussex we actually make a third of the time they spend on the university component of their courses compulsory work in science — that is to say every student does it — so we can actually do something about it practically by looking at our processes of initial training and coming to realise what an important section of the world this is and training teachers accordingly, and not to leave it at that but to continue with erm progressive and planned in-service training of teachers.<endOfText>
<bot>Our own experience from several of the projects that we've been looking at which are in-service type projects, is that when we do train teachers and when we do put an investment in it, we see the pay-off in the schools that physical science does get done in schools, it is fun and it is exciting.<endOfText>
<human>It's when the teachers think this is a boring, mundane, difficult thing to do, then that tends to be put over to the children and of course the disaster is that the children will believe it, and it if the children will believe it then we grow up in a highly technological society producing very few technologists or scientists.<endOfText>
<bot>What you describe does sound a little bit like a chicken and egg situation from the point of view that I think you were saying that erm many teachers are ill-equipped, actually, to teach erm physics, perhaps, and chemistry, whereas they are a little bit better able to get across fundamental ideas in biology, and in a sense because of this they are going to produce another generation who perhaps have very ill-founded ideas of these basic sciences and so on and so forth, and somehow one's got to cut into this cycle and actually improve it, improve the output somehow.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, the chicken and egg syndrome is interesting because  and I agree it is a vicious circle, but in fact you don't make new omelettes unless you do break some eggs, and I think the time has come to break some eggs and I think that's what I'm advocating is that it will come from the teacher because the teacher is the guiding light of what happens in the classroom, and if the teacher has it in the back of their mind there will be no science, then there will be no science.<endOfText>
<bot>If, on the other hand, the teacher has it in the back of their mind always to be aware of the possibility of bringing into the work that's going on in the classroom and bringing all they're usually very excellent pedagogic skills to bear on it, aspects of the physical sciences, so that the children can get an early and meaningful introduction to it, then it will happen.<endOfText>
<human>The question is how do you break into the cycle and make that happen, and I think the answer is, as I said, in two ways — one by making teachers more aware during their period of initial training, either at college or at university or polytechnic, and secondly by looking very carefully at the amount and type of in-service training erm that goes on for teachers once they've left college and are in the schools.<endOfText>
<bot>Essentially what you're saying is that a teacher who's actually teaching you ought to be able to say to that teacher ‘look, here's a package, if you like, that you can insert into your range of skills, and these are of things that you can do with children which are worthwhile doing and fairly easily for you to acquire skills yourself, and they will be very good and helpful for the children’.<endOfText>
<human>Well I'd only say that initially erm because then what you end up with is a sort of lucky dip which every now and then somebody will remember the bag of science tricks that somebody's taught them and dip into.<endOfText>
<bot>Now I think that's better than nothing, but I think one has to take it a stage further than that and say that erm the concepts and the processes in science do build logically one upon the other, in a coherent and meaningful way, and that's important for teachers to appreciate what that meaningful sequence is and that, you know, the lucky dip idea is, as I have said, better than nothing, but it's so much inferior to the notion that teachers should be aware that there is a progression in science and that they can teach children progressively from a very early age onwards and build meaningful knowledge upon meaningful knowledge.<endOfText>
<human>Is there anything that parents can do?<endOfText>
<bot>Christmas is coming up and there are chemistry sets in the shops.<endOfText>
<human>Do these make good gifts from a scientific point of view?<endOfText>
<bot>Well they're a lot of fun and kids love them.<endOfText>
<human>As I commented a little earlier to somebody, I still haven't quite forgiven my mother-in-law for the chemistry set she bought my seven-year-old.<endOfText>
<bot>He is absolutely amazed by it and spends lots of time in a garage at the back, which actually means that I spend an awful lot of time  in that garage in the cold too!<endOfText>
<human>Yes, they are good sets and they do  they are exciting for children.<endOfText>
<bot>They do enjoy them and they do make good use of them.<endOfText>
<human>Quite often they need a lot of erm time spent by the parent with the child, and if the parent's happy with that they're fine.<endOfText>
<bot>None of them, or very few of them, if you buy a good quality one is dangerous.<endOfText>
<human>It's very important, I think, that erm you match the age of the child to the age which is written on the box, because then the child will actually be handling materials that he can physically handle and ideas that he can physically cope with or intellectually cope with.<endOfText>
<bot>So they are probably very useful erm toys, educational toys, to have in the home, but I think for the child to get the maximum from them they do  he often does require an adult with him.<endOfText>
<human>How about electronic kits and circuits?<endOfText>
<bot>Are they worthwhile, would you say?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, they are; they are very much.<endOfText>
<bot>Again, it's a question of matching the kit to the age of the child because some of them erm — the one we have at home, for example, plugs into the mains and although it only pushes out six or nine volts at the end the child actually does have to plug it in and, well I don't think I'd be happy if my six or seven year old was doing that, although my nine year old could cope with it quite happily.<endOfText>
<human>So they are useful erm children can learn a lot.<endOfText>
<bot>What I like about them and where I think their strengths are is that they do put science, the physical sciences, in that bracket of activity which is fun, excitement and leisure and enjoyment and that it moves away from the notion that it's something you do on a wet Friday afternoon at school.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you very much, Mike.<endOfText>
<bot>In our series on education we've talked about many aspects of school life, including the extent to which they are open or closed societies and various features of the curriculum.<endOfText>
<human>But so far we haven't said much about schools as organisations.<endOfText>
<bot>Today I have with me Tony Bailey from the university; Bob Glover, who is Principal of Portslade Community College; and John Werner, who is Head of Stanley Deason High School.<endOfText>
<human>Tony, are schools today very different from the schools of the past?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I'm not sure I'm a very competent person to answer that question Brian, but I hope erm Bob and John might move to that.<endOfText>
<human>My research interests are just in schools today.<endOfText>
<bot>I think perhaps one difference is they've become much larger and more complicated and I certainly think that parents in particular tend to expect far more of schools now than they used to.<endOfText>
<human>Schools are very large and complex organisations.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean there are over a thousand people, sometimes two thousand people there, and in this erm complex organisation I think headmasters are very important people; they're responsible for developing a style of organisation which is, I think, very significant.<endOfText>
<human>They influence the education of children in enormously important ways, not just in terms of how many exams they pass, what results they get at O level or C S E, but on important issues such as education for democracy, the kind of climate that schools create for young people is very important in the way they see society and they see their role in it.<endOfText>
<bot>So from my point of view it's very important to have contact with head teachers and to talk with them about these things, and to create a situation in which they can talk to each other.<endOfText>
<human>Bob, are you erm head teacher in any classical sense, or are you more a manager?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I think of myself, probably arrogantly, as an educational leader, but that certainly would include management as well as being an academic.<endOfText>
<human>If I can just say something about the management to start off with.<endOfText>
<bot>I think sometimes people who don't actually work in schools imagine that the schools are managed, in the financial organisational sense, by the Local Education Authority, and that in some way the head of the school is merely concerned with discipline, curriculum and so on, but one has to bear in mind that the sheer size of some of these schools now makes the head a manager in a very real sense.<endOfText>
<human>I mean I have to cope with about five thousand different individuals each week erm at Portslade Community College, erm fifteen hundred full-time eleven to eighteen year olds, and the rest adults from the community coming in to use the college.<endOfText>
<bot>Now if I don't exercise some management skill, and of course more and more recently financial erm acumen as well, one's going to have a situation approaching chaos.<endOfText>
<human>I think the first point to make is erm that schools, and particularly community colleges, are now very complicated places, and it would be quite wrong for a head of an establishment like that to think of himself as an academic in an ivory tower, because if he did erm the organisation would become entangled, the money would run out, and in fact he wouldn't have the kind of institution he wants.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you have the same views, though, John.<endOfText>
<human>Well I agree with what Bob has said.<endOfText>
<bot>When parents come round the school, what they sometimes say is ‘My goodness we never had all these facilities’, so at a very superficial level you could say that is a big change.<endOfText>
<human>After the War, I suppose, and in the Fifties, when schools were seen as places preparing young people for a very different world, different kinds of resources were put in.<endOfText>
<bot>One can read about, and see on television, schools which are pioneering and really are genuinely different, but I think they're very much the exception.<endOfText>
<human>And while it's very reassuring that schools haven't changed too much — I don't think we want everything to change overnight — I think you could say that schools are open to the same criticism as of British industry at the moment, that they are institutions which perhaps are changing too slowly for the demands of the modern world.<endOfText>
<bot>Tony Bailey, when he was talking just now, talked in terms of schools perhaps having an element of democracy within them.<endOfText>
<human>Is that actually possible in a school?<endOfText>
<bot>Can a school be a democratic organisation in any real sense?<endOfText>
<human>Well I'm probably regarded as being of a point just to the right of Ghengis Khan on these matters.<endOfText>
<bot>erm a great deal is talked about democracy in schools and you very often have all kinds of organisations allegedly which take democratic decisions.<endOfText>
<human>In fact, if anything goes wrong at Portslade Community College it's my fault, and therefore I'm not going to be in a position where I don't feel able to take responsibility for any decision made.<endOfText>
<bot>Any true democracy of the sort that you might have in a university, if you do, is really impossible in schools and that  one reason because of what the law says, the other reason of course is the age of the people you're dealing with.<endOfText>
<human>In the old days, life was simple in schools in the sense that if pupils didn't do what they were supposed to do you thrashed them, or made them stand in the corner, or expelled them.<endOfText>
<bot>How do you actually make pupils do things?<endOfText>
<human>Well I think I must take issue with you when you talk about the old days.<endOfText>
<bot>erm I doubt if it really was like that  come on!<endOfText>
<human>And I think that the question of making people do things, that's something in all societies which doesn't change too much.<endOfText>
<bot>There's a question of how much force you use and how much persuasion you use.<endOfText>
<human>I remember when my school opened, or just before it did, erm I got the staff together for a conference for a day, and got another East Sussex Head, James Quinn, who came along and talked to them, and one of the things he said was now for the next week or two, whatever John Werner says goes.<endOfText>
<bot>If he says stand on your head you will, but after that he's got to do it all by persuasion.<endOfText>
<human>The question of democracy is a very difficult one and it operates on different levels.<endOfText>
<bot>On one level you can ask, not so much democracy within the school, but the question of accountability to the community it serves — who should run the school, how much should parents be involved, what's the role of Governors?<endOfText>
<human>There's that side of things, and I hope that that is changing, alas again too slowly erm I think the Taylor report, which firmly came down on the side of more lay control of schools by parents and members of the community, put up and unanswerable case.<endOfText>
<bot>I've never seen it answered, but erm that didn't prevent the professionals from shelving it.<endOfText>
<human>But nevertheless, quietly, the community is getting more and more involved and having a bigger say at that level.<endOfText>
<bot>When you come to internal democracy and how much, say, the pupils have, I agree with Bob that is a very tricky one and certainly you can't just transplant erm democracy onto what is really a rather authoritarian system, you'd have to prepare and train pupils much more than we do and what I think is the most dangerous thing is playing at democracy which I am sure we should not do in schools.<endOfText>
<human>I think that some people may not realise fully too is that in order to make a decision you have to be full informed, and teachers are very busy people and a teacher really is spending nearly every moment of his day either teaching or preparing to teach, and it's impossible, therefore, to establish in a school or a community college the faculty committee structure that one might have in a university, where people do probably spend some time informing themselves before debate.<endOfText>
<bot>erm it's a very great problem.<endOfText>
<human>One would like very often to have more erm people involved in decision making, but they simply don't have the time to inform themselves and one or two experiments in the kind of democracy you might  Brian might have had in mind, came to horrible grief where decisions were taken simply uninformed and where the small number of people present who were informed weren't able to persuade the majority and the history of education is littered with them  most unfortunate examples of this.<endOfText>
<bot>I think the approach of parents is very often really quite a simple one erm that they have a number of very well defined expectations of the school and that is as far as one individual parent is concerned, that the parents wants the child to go to the school, he wants that child properly controlled, provided that it's done in the way in which he particularly approves, and if you have fifteen hundred different parents there might be fourteen hundred and eighty five different techniques at work here, and then he wants the child simultaneously to be successful and happy.<endOfText>
<human>And traditionally, I find, British parents tend to erm say on the one hand we'll let the school get on and do their professional job — I find it quite depressing they don't ask for more say in the organisation, but they do demand, quite rightly, the right to criticise when things go wrong.<endOfText>
<bot>Now this may be because we're on the way from one position to another, or it may be a traditional British approach, but I find this personally a great source of pressure because on the one hand I recognise as a parent myself one's going to have a crucial interest in the education of one's child, on the other hand how one reconciles those hundreds of different philosophies and then superimposes upon it a professional approach is, I suppose, the greatest single source of strain I find running a large secondary school, particularly, as I said before, in the end the responsibility in law is mine.<endOfText>
<human>I would say you could defend the British position because what it seems to me to be based on is first of all the idea that the institution itself should make the decision, and that surely is a democratic start, that you don't lay down a rule from Newcastle to John O'Groats, or wherever, and that the people in the institution have a certain chemistry together.<endOfText>
<bot>What may suit one place won't suit another.<endOfText>
<human>I think secondly erm whichever country, and you do look back to your roots, and we for better or for worse here look back to the great public school headmaster of a century ago and I still think people want that kind of dynamic drive, that entrepreneurial drive, and who's to say they're wrong?<endOfText>
<bot>And I think what we're looking for is a kind of situation where everyone can play their proper part in the decision-making, but allow the person with the energy and drive to play their part as well in giving a lead, and I'm not sure that's such a bad thing.<endOfText>
<human>Equally, I think we like to set up experiments first before plunging for something, so you have got in Countess Thorpe , or the Stantonbury Campus, experiments in a fuller kind of democracy which appear to be very successful if a little controversial.<endOfText>
<bot>On the other hand, there are many places which are moving far more cautiously.<endOfText>
<human>But at least people feel secure in those places and move gradually towards something.<endOfText>
<bot>So I think we could be too pessimistic about this.<endOfText>
<human>I also feel, Brian, we may be avoiding the question that  or the part of this question which some of our listeners may be particularly interest in, and Bob did touch upon it, which is have things changed much in democracy in the classroom, is there a change?<endOfText>
<bot>I think there are some significant ones.<endOfText>
<human>Michael Marland has talked about the disappearance of deference and I think that's the biggest change really that the kind of instant erm response to authority has gone and that has good and bad sides in it, so more is demanded of the teacher because his authority has to be earned, much more even than in the past I think.<endOfText>
<bot>So if you handle it well, we'll move forward.<endOfText>
<human>If we don't learn how to handle that particularly well, we won't, but I think we should assure  reassure parents that schools are full of good disciplinarians and that, democracy or no democracy, classrooms are in control.<endOfText>
<bot>I think you've always got to be aware too that what goes on in schools does, and should, reflect what's going on out of schools.<endOfText>
<human>One of the things that I think is most unfortunate is that parents sometimes say to their youngsters ‘You need to go to school in order to learn how to behave’.<endOfText>
<bot>I would respond with some vigour that they need to go home to learn how to behave, so that the present themselves at school in the situation where we can exercise our professional job of teaching them.<endOfText>
<human>The unfortunately British idea that at school, as well as a place of learning and a place where you grow from a child into an adult, is a kind of military disciplinary academy, I think is most unfortunate.<endOfText>
<bot>erm I have two children and I have found that it was quite a full-time job persuading them of the virtue of certain old-fashioned ways of going about things.<endOfText>
<human>I would not, for one moment, pretend erm that it is my job to inculcate those virtues in fifteen hundred.<endOfText>
<bot>I hope, though, there are fifteen hundred families in Portslade who are doing that job, not for me but for them, so that we can carry out the important educational processes that go on within the college.<endOfText>
<human>And so, parents that may be listening, it sounds as if it's up to you to provide the basic training to enable the schools to do their part.<endOfText>
<bot>That's all that we have time for today.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you very much, gentlemen.<endOfText>
<bot>Michael, you're interested in evaluation in education.<endOfText>
<human>What do you mean by evaluation?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I think of evaluation as the process by which a person or a group of people have a fairly careful look at something they're doing in order to try and decide whether it's going well or badly, whether there are things in it they might wish to improve, and how valuable they think it is  whether they might want to make changes in it in any way.<endOfText>
<human>So you're interested in, for example, teaching of subjects such as history or mathematics in schools and the evaluation in a total sense of this?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, well I don't particularly limit the area of what I'm interested, but if someone who was particularly interested in seeing how history was going over in this school, then I'd be very happy in discussing with them how they might try and find out how successful history teaching was in that school for example.<endOfText>
<human>Or perhaps one might just narrow it a bit further than that and say well let's see how history is going in the first two years, or the O level history course, or something like that, and we would discuss well given that all these different people are involved in history or have a stake in it in some way, or are interested in it, and given that you're only going to have a very limited amount of time to do anything in, how can you do something that would be genuinely useful to the school in looking at the history teaching and something that would have the support of the people involved so that it wasn't threatening anybody but they felt there was something being genuinely helpful.<endOfText>
<bot>Could you give me an example of one or two erm evaluation exercises you're engaged in at the moment?<endOfText>
<human>Well I get involved in it in  so many different ways erm this is a difficult one, but one of the things that happens is that a number of teachers, both from the area and elsewhere, erm do advanced courses at the university and as part of these courses we have a unit on evaluation, and for this they will choose some area of their school work which they and their colleagues — and I emphasise that this is something they do have to involve  their colleagues back at school in very much — erm feel it would be useful to look at and then they try and discuss with their colleagues what aspects of it are important and significant and what ought to be seen, and they bring this discussion back and we all discuss together  there'll be different teachers working on different problems  the different ways in which they could approach this problem and how they might most usefully be able to do it and at the end of the exercise they will have found out quite a lot about this particular area of teaching and very often we find that the people they've consulted have themselves got quite interested in it and begun to realize that it's not being done in a way that's there to threaten them, they're not sending a report to the headmaster or the Chief Education Officer or anything like that — it's for the benefit of the people doing the work themselves.<endOfText>
<bot>And very often erm discussions take place, changes may happen in the school as a result of this work.<endOfText>
<human>So although they also may submit it to us as part of their assessment for a project, I mean we're at least as interested in the work being useful to the schools and to the students involved.<endOfText>
<bot>So that's one major area of involvement.<endOfText>
<human>The other one erm is within the university itself because we do have a support organisation here for teaching within the university, and it is possible for groups of teachers in any part of the university to ask for some help and support in looking at one of the courses they're involved in teaching.<endOfText>
<bot>So we get involved quite a lot in looking at teaching in various parts of the university where people want us to, very often involving the students as well as the other teachers in looking at a particular course and seeing if there are ways in which perhaps it might be taught differently or in a way that worked better.<endOfText>
<human>So when you're setting about setting up an evaluation project you consider it very important to get the co-operation of the teachers and staff involved.<endOfText>
<bot>I think this absolutely vital because in my mind the object of doing an evaluation is to create some kind of improvement in the situation that is being evaluated.<endOfText>
<human>Those  I'm not interested in producing reports and publications out of evaluation studies, I'm interested in affecting the situation and affecting it to the mutual satisfaction of the people involved in it, and in fact when we're  when I'm working with people on an evaluation, or discussing evaluation in general, one of the major items of our discussion always is how can you consult other people, how can you get them involved?<endOfText>
<bot>And I say to them ‘Look, don't start planning this whole thing on your own from the beginning, go round and talk to the various people you know that are interested and say to them ‘Look, I'm planning to try and do this work, or we agreed at such and such a meeting that I would do this work, but I don't just want to do this on my own, I want to take into account other people's views.<endOfText>
<human>Now for example if I'm looking at O level history, what sort of things do you think might be important, or what kinds of evidence do you think I ought to collect, or what issues do you think I ought to take into account?’.<endOfText>
<bot>So one tries to build up a kind of agenda of all the things that different people involved think might be important before one tries to produce a plan as to how one's going to work, and even then there may be a chance for you actually to discuss the plan with various people as well.<endOfText>
<human>Obviously there is a very delicate balance between erm demanding too much of people's time in consulting and talking with you, and not involving them at all, and you have to be very sensitive to how much time people are prepared to give and how much they want to be involved in something.<endOfText>
<bot>But often I find if you ask people these questions they get very interested erm and this interest is important.<endOfText>
<human>If people aren't interested in an evaluation of something that concerns them, then nothing will happen at the end of it.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean there's no earthly use doing a beautiful piece of evaluation erm which no-one wants to know about at the end, or publishing something that has no affect.<endOfText>
<human>People have to be involved in something if they're going to want to do something at the end.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean if the evaluation suggests that something or other needs changing, then you want people to be already so interested in the evaluation and perhaps looking for useful things to come out of it, that they are already half committed to the changes.<endOfText>
<human>One doesn't want them to sort of follow it blindly, of course, one wants them to discuss it carefully , very carefully, but it has to sort of fit into the ongoing life of the institution and not be a kind of little game that someone is playing on their own somewhere because they happen to be linked with the university or doing a degree or something.<endOfText>
<bot>So you're very careful to avoid imposing your own values on the evaluation process?<endOfText>
<human>Well I think it is impossible for anyone to totally avoid bringing in their own values into work that they're doing to some extent, but I think it is possible to deliberately set out to involve the values of other people in the way that you carry out the work.<endOfText>
<bot>If you do that, then I think that even though your own values are bound to be in it a bit, they won't be in it in a way that makes the work useless or makes it appear hopefully prejudiced to someone else.<endOfText>
<human>You see traditionally people used to think of an evaluation as something that was very convergent and first people gathered lots of evidence, and then they wrote a set of recommendations or conclusions, and you were supposed to agree them or follow them afterwards.<endOfText>
<bot>erm unfortunately life isn't really quite as simple as that.<endOfText>
<human>I mean people don't always agree on what evidence means; they don't always agree on what is the best thing to do, erm and I've developed the idea that it's possible to do an evaluation that I like to call divergent in the sense that there might be several different things that one might do as a result of it.<endOfText>
<bot>For example, if one has found out something about a course, about what's happening on it, how well the pupils are learning, how interested they are in it and what different members of staff think of its value and so on , then you've got a certain amount of evidence about it.<endOfText>
<human>Now the next question is what does this evidence mean and what does one do with it.<endOfText>
<bot>Now here it depends on people's values, where their educational priorities are, what one might do.<endOfText>
<human>Now I'm suggesting that an evaluator might, instead of just concentrating on one set of values, deliberately try and look at several, so they might, for example, identify that there were a group of people who felt that history should be taught in a certain particular way for a certain purpose.<endOfText>
<bot>Now they could then say well that particular group of people, if they looked at this evidence that I've got, would want to say this about it and they would want to change it in such and such a way, and there's another group of people who perhaps have rather different views on what history might be doing and they would view the evidence and argue about it in this way.<endOfText>
<human>So one might develop two, three, even four different attitudes towards the evidence, according to what one thought was important.<endOfText>
<bot>Now my feeling is that in doing an evaluation one ought to try and develop each of these different viewpoints, then leave it to the people concerned that have to make the decisions to pick up each of these and to make the decisions, but at least the evaluation itself is not sort of ruling out of court any of the viewpoints that could be important in that situation, so any person who's involved, even if they're in a minority of one, at least feels that his views are there in the evaluation somewhere and they're made legitimate by it.<endOfText>
<human>Well he knows that his views may not necessarily be the majority and count in the end, but at least they're being taken into account and being considered to be important.<endOfText>
<bot>So I see evaluation as a very democratic activity, which allows people perhaps to appreciate each other 's viewpoints a little more than might otherwise be the case erm and doesn't pretend that people all feel the same about things, but at the same time it doesn't attempt to sort of countermand the realities of the situation that, you know, each person can't go their own sweet way, there have to be quite a lot of collective decisions and people have to recognise where the majority opinion is, but at least they do it from a standpoint that erm where they feel their own value still has some worth and is still being recognised.<endOfText>
<human>If you're involving all those concerned with an evaluation exercise, how can you be objective?<endOfText>
<bot>How do you know you are not distorting the situation totally because everyone know they're taking part in an evaluation exercise?<endOfText>
<human>Well there are two sides to that.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean I think the first is that the kind of evidence one picks up, none of it on its own can be considered, I think, to be totally objective or totally valid, but what it does is it builds up a part of a picture and gradually different sorts of evidence build up a rather more complicated, rather more perhaps accurate picture of a situation, and it's really the cross-checking of different kinds of evidence that in the end gives the thing some kind of validity.<endOfText>
<human>The other aspect of the question you raised is really that do you change a situation by the very fact that you're doing an evaluation?<endOfText>
<bot>Do people sort of artificially put on their best behaviour, as it were, or something like that, and thereby give a sort of rather distorted impression as to what's really going on.<endOfText>
<human>Now obviously this can happen a bit, but I don't think, on the whole it happens very much, at least certainly not in a way that matters erm I don't think it does matter if people change things a little bit, because erm  but on the whole people are doing things in the way that they're doing them erm because they've got accustomed to doing them that way and that's the way that they've planned it, and that's the way that it comes out as a result of all of those pressures that there are on them.<endOfText>
<bot>Most professional people are subject to an enormous range of presses and constraints.<endOfText>
<human>Even in a school one has to think of a very large number of different pupils with their own different characteristics and strengths and weaknesses, and one has to operate in a classroom and to a timetable and with given resources, and so on and so forth, and the combination of all these pressures and the ways that one has got used to handling them, on the whole, is what makes a person teach the way they do.<endOfText>
<bot>That, combined with their own personality.<endOfText>
<human>And they're not really going to change this very much because someone says well we're involved in an evaluation now.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think it's  it's not going to change the situation that much.<endOfText>
<human>Supposing you have taken part in an evaluation exercise and some conclusions have been mutually agreed, do you find that on the whole people are prepared to change their habits  presumably in some cases habits built up over many years?<endOfText>
<bot>Ah well that's a difficult question.<endOfText>
<human>I mean there are obviously some aspects of a school's policy that are relatively easily changed.<endOfText>
<bot>There are other things that emerge from evaluation that perhaps suggest that at least, not necessarily universally, but for that particular school, with those particular children, with those particular aims, if they want to achieve what they're trying to achieve, then they're going to have to make some rather more  or at least some of the people are going to have to make some rather more fundamental changes in the way that they, say, handle children in the classroom, than might otherwise be the case.<endOfText>
<human>Now if you get a situation like that  I mean the key question is do people actually want to change in this kind of way, or would they at least like to sort of experiment a little bit in the way they handle a group of children?<endOfText>
<bot>And this is a very, very difficult thing to do because a teacher, I think, sort of maintains control in a classroom and is able to handle the situation because they've developed working routines over a period of years.<endOfText>
<human>In a sense this is what it is to become and experienced teacher rather than a novice.<endOfText>
<bot>One has to develop routines to cope with the situation because it is far too complicated a situation to be handled in any other way.<endOfText>
<human>You just cannot pay attention continuously to all the different variables  in a situation and remain sane at the end of the day, you have to develop routines and techniques for handling it.<endOfText>
<bot>Now if anyone asks if you feel for any sense that perhaps some of these routines have perhaps got a bit of  become inappropriate in some way, perhaps because you're teaching a different type of child, or perhaps because you've got rather different educational aims, they've changed for some reason, then it's like asking someone to go back to being a novice again in some senses to change.<endOfText>
<human>Now this is a very, very difficult thing to ask anyone to do.<endOfText>
<bot>Now I think it says a lot for teachers as a profession that I think many of them are in fact prepared to have a go at this.<endOfText>
<human>But it's something that I think someone can only have a go at if they have a great deal of support and a chance to experiment in a way that still gives them the option erm not to change if they feel that they can't handle it any other way erm so I think there are a lot of difficulties associated with this kind of problem.<endOfText>
<bot>Now I mean I am interested in this problem, and I have been involved in situations where teachers have sought help in trying to change their teaching style in the classroom, but in all these cases this help  the initiative has been very much from the teachers themselves and they've wanted to do it, they've wanted to experiment with it and have been given a lot of support and help with it.<endOfText>
<human>But I think I would be giving you the wrong impression if I suggested that most of the evaluation studies with which I've been concerned have involved this kind of conclusion, or this kind of result.<endOfText>
<bot>Most of them it's been questions of rather less fundamental changes in the actual teaching style in the classroom and sometimes it's been a question of concentrating on rather different kinds of things or giving more time to one kind of activity than another, or changing the pattern of assignments that they gave children, or things that were still well within the capacity of teachers to change without involving sort of fundamental changes in teaching style.<endOfText>
<human>So I wouldn't like to give the impression that there aren't very many improvements that can sometimes be found erm that don't involve that kind of fundamental change, I mean I think there many improvements of that kind.<endOfText>
<bot>What about the effect of examinations on creative teaching staff?<endOfText>
<human>Don't you come across many teachers who say something along the lines ‘I'd love to try this experiment’, or ‘I'd like to try this in a different way, but I have C S E or O level or A level coming up for my children in a term or a year and I can't possibly afford to do other than cram them for these examinations’.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh I think many teachers say that an even more parents say it.<endOfText>
<human>erm this is, I think, one of the dilemmas we have in our society at the moment.<endOfText>
<bot>In fact one of the things that's most disturbed me about some of the recent discussions that have taken place in the great debate has been that on the one hand people have talked about educating people for adult life and learning more about the way people earn their living, learning more about industry, more about productive things, and on the other hand they've been talking about maintaining standards.<endOfText>
<human>Now it's one of those unfortunate things that when people talk about maintaining standards, the only sort of, in an sense, external sort of guidance they've got to go for are things like examination passes.<endOfText>
<bot>Now I don't think many people realized that asking for the maintenance of standards, rather than perhaps the changing of standards, was asking for something that was almost diametrically opposed to asking for an educational system that was more geared towards preparing children for adult life and productive work.<endOfText>
<human>erm until some of the people who are putting a lot of pressures on schools to do different things are prepared to resolve some of these contradictions, I think the teachers feel that they're being continually criticised by different groups for not doing different things, many of which are mutually contradictory, erm and not surprisingly they feel a little defensive in this situation.<endOfText>
<bot>And lastly on the subject of evaluation, a question about the extent to which you think evaluation should take place.<endOfText>
<human>Do you think there's enough of it in the educational profession, or do you think that one ought to go in for much more evaluation?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I think a lot of evaluation does go on.<endOfText>
<human>I mean I think part of being a proper professional means that one does attempt to evaluate what one is doing, and I think that most teachers do do this.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that the issue really is erm are there ways in which perhaps they could be helped to do this more productively, and are there ways in which they could be helped to do this rather more collaboratively than perhaps they have done so in the past?<endOfText>
<human>Now my concern is not really with trying to erm get outside people or people in universities to sort of be involved in evaluations necessarily, it's with helping people within schools to acquire more skills in the area of evaluation, so that schools, whenever they feel it would be useful to them, have got enough professional expertise among their own members to be able to perhaps rather more the quality of their evaluation and to see that it gets put perhaps to rather more purpose.<endOfText>
<bot>In other words to see that they get more benefit for the effort that they put into it.<endOfText>
<human>Another aspect of it, I think, is that a lot of evaluation is very intuitive and instinctive.<endOfText>
<bot>I think this is rightly so, but there is an advantage to knowing  to being slightly more explicit about how you're doing it, and I think that if a lot of the evaluation that already went on in schools became a little bit more explicit and a little bit more open, it would be much easier for people outside the schools to realize the extent at which schools were themselves already engaging in evaluation.<endOfText>
<human>I think a lot of the current concern about schools being accountable is partly because things that in fact are being done are not being seen to be done, and I think if many of the things that we already done were more obviously being seen to be done, and perhaps also thought through rather more carefully as to how they were being done, the public would feel generally erm happier about what was going on in their schools than perhaps they are at the moment.<endOfText>
<bot>Michael, thank you very much.<endOfText>
<human>Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.<endOfText>
<bot>It's once again my very pleasant task to welcome you to this, which is the thirty eighth in the series of great centenary lectures, that were inaugurated in this hall in nineteen seventy on a very noteworthy and somewhat stormy occasion.<endOfText>
<human>The lectures are part of a larger programme, designed to bring members of the university and of the local community, to bring them together in serious consideration of great issues, great ideas and great people in the sciences, the humanities and the social sciences.<endOfText>
<bot>And looking round the hall tonight, I think I would be inclined to say that this occasion seems to have been successful in doing that.<endOfText>
<human>It is very pleasant to see a full hall on an inclement evening.<endOfText>
<bot>And I would like in consequence to offer the very warmest welcome to those of you who are visitors to the university.<endOfText>
<human>I know there are many, and I know that quite a few of you are students in the classes run by the Centre for Continuing Education.<endOfText>
<bot>I will not yield to the temptation to reflect on the problems that face this university and the Centre for Continuing Education as part of it, but I think that it's fair to say that in the future we will be hard put to maintain the volume and variety of the contribution we have been trying to make to adult education in the community.<endOfText>
<human>Personally, I sincerely hope that we will be able to continue with these open lectures, which I think have been a significant feature of the university's life and of our relationships with the community.<endOfText>
<bot>In the meantime, it is very pleasant, and indeed it's salutary, to remind ourselves, as we are doing this evening, of what a university is actually about.<endOfText>
<human>Among other things, the examination of the nature and impact of scientific theories and research, and to engage in a re-assessment of the status of these theories and the status of their creators in the light of new knowledge and a new climate of thinking and feeling.<endOfText>
<bot>Now we had no doubt about the inclusion of Charles Darwin's centenary in this series at this point; certainly one of the half dozen most influential figures of the modern world, in reshaping our perceptions of ourselves and of the rest of the world.<endOfText>
<human>We couldn't get the centenary of the Origin of Species into our programme — that was nineteen fifty nine and we hadn't started then — but I did persuade tonight's speaker to deliver one of our early centenary lectures on the subject of Darwin's subsequent book, that is the book on the Descent of Man, which appeared in eighteen seventy one, and I am sure that those of you who were there on that occasion in December eighteen seventy one will remember it as a stimulating and  <endOfText>
<bot>lecture.<endOfText>
<human>None of seems to have grown much older  <endOfText>
<bot>and I'm certainly show that few of us have grown any wiser in the intervening decade.<endOfText>
<human>In the light of all that, ladies and gentlemen, the choice of a speaker for the Charles Darwin centenary was not difficult, and indeed I know that he welcomed the opportunity to give this lecture, not least I'm sure because of the controversies and the general noise that have erupted once again over the issues of evolution, both in the academies of the civilized western world, and even in deepest Arkensaw <endOfText>
<bot>John Maynard-Smith is our Professor of Biology.<endOfText>
<human>He did, in fact, start in an other area of expertise — he took a degree in engineering at the University of Cambridge and worked during the War as an aircraft engineer.<endOfText>
<bot>I must say that it sheds some light on the state of some of the aircraft that I had to fly in then.<endOfText>
<human>He then entered the University College, London, to study zoology and stayed on to work with a very distinguished man, J B S Halldane on the genetics and behaviour of the fruit fly.<endOfText>
<bot>In passing I have reflected its natural selection and our God had not created the fruit fly, it would have been necessary for biologists to have invented it.<endOfText>
<human>In nineteen sixty five, which was rather after I came here, he moved to the University of Sussex, where he became the first Dean of the new School of Biological Sciences, and that was the beginning of a very distinguished contribution to scientific work in this university.<endOfText>
<bot>John is the author of numerous scientific articles and books, including the Theory of Evolution, which has gone into its third edition — I mean the book.<endOfText>
<human>The Evolution of Sex and the Evolution and Theory of Games.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm delighted that he has accepted the invitation to return after a decade to lecture to us on Charles Darwin.<endOfText>
<human>John Maynard-Smith.<endOfText>
<bot>Just over a year ago, over a thousand biologists gathered at an international meeting in Vancouver.<endOfText>
<human>It was, in fact, the second international conference on Evolutionary Biology, not that it's anything to do with what I'm now saying, but the next one is actually going to be right here in 1985 and that'll be nice.<endOfText>
<bot>But anyway, this was the first  we have such a conference every five years, but over a thousand of us sat around for a week and talked about evolution, and there was one rather curious fact about Vancouver, or the media of Vancouver, during that week.<endOfText>
<human>I watched the newspapers with a good deal of interest.<endOfText>
<bot>I could discover no mention whatever of the fact that this conference was going on in its city erm but there was one mention of evolution.<endOfText>
<human>There was a full page article announcing Darwinism is dead, which turned out as a matter of fact to be a reprint of an article which had appeared some months earlier in the Sunday Times of this country, erm which in fact was based very largely on some work by a young man called Steele, which none of us, I think, believed at the time, and which was since turned out clearly to have been mistaken.<endOfText>
<bot>erm it is a little odd that this should have been so.<endOfText>
<human>It illustrates something that those of us who work in the field of evolutionary biology sort of grow to live with, which is that anything which casts doubt on Darwin will get a good blow up in the press, on television, and so on.<endOfText>
<bot>Let me give another very recent example while these rather alarming, in some ways, events were going on in Arkensaw, the London Times — not the Sunday Times now — had as a centre page article by a distinguished cosmologist, Fred Hoyle, announcing to a startled world that he'd suddenly acquired some doubts about evolution.<endOfText>
<human>Now the Times has never asked me to write a leading article announcing that I have some doubts about the quantum theory <endOfText>
<bot>And I do have such doubts but, being a modest person as you know <endOfText>
<human>I have always put it down to my ability to understand the subject <endOfText>
<bot>erm but no such modesty  erm it's just another illustration of the same thing.<endOfText>
<human>If somebody can be persuaded to say something which is critical of Darwin he can get his name in the papers or on the box.<endOfText>
<bot>Now erm in some ways actually this makes it rather nice to be an evolutionist because it means that people care, you know, people are actually interested in what you're doing and that's fun.<endOfText>
<human>People clearly are interested in what Darwin had to say erm and they mind about whether he was right or not, and I think that many people, I dare say many people in this room, have a wish which they may be conscious of and they may not, sometimes quite a strong wish, that he'll turn out to be wrong.<endOfText>
<bot>And I think one has to ask themselves why should this be so?<endOfText>
<human>I mean they don't feel that way about quantum theory as far as I know.<endOfText>
<bot>But I do — I'm sure it's wrong <endOfText>
<human>But, you know, I know that that's a personal idiosyncrasy.<endOfText>
<bot>I think the reason why it is so is that Darwinism is, in essence, a theory about the origin of man — a lot of things as well, but it includes a theory about how we came to be here.<endOfText>
<human>But it's a theory which doesn't give us an special or privileged role or position in this origin.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean okay so we're here, but so are elephants and fruit flies and centipedes and tape worms and things erm nothing special about us. erm we're rather successful right now, but we don't play any very special role.<endOfText>
<human>People expect of a theory of origins that in some way or other it gives them some quite privileged and special position, and they feel undermined and threatened by a theory of origin which doesn't say something really rather special about them.<endOfText>
<bot>And it's for this reason, I think, that people quite properly are interested in Darwin's theory of evolution, are worried about it and so on.<endOfText>
<human>Now, having started in that light, I may be going to disappoint you by saying that I'm not in fact going to spend the next erm fifty minutes or so talking about the moral, political, philosophical implications of Darwinism.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean I could do  I think they're fascinating and important — but I would prefer instead actually to talk about Darwinism  Darwin as a biologist, rather than Darwin as a philosopher or as a influencer of morals and religious beliefs and so on.<endOfText>
<human>erm and I want, in fact, to ask, you know, is there in fact a challenge to Darwinism among scientists today — among serious scientists today, I mean scientists who actually know something about the subject — and the answer to that question is yes there is.<endOfText>
<bot>What's the nature of this challenge? erm what's the evidence for and against it?<endOfText>
<human>What's it's likely fate?<endOfText>
<bot>Of course you will appreciate that I am in no sense unbiased on these matters — I have strong and, I believe, correct opinions on these matters <endOfText>
<human>which I shall not attempt to conceal from you, but before I come down to the details let me say that Darwinism occupies such a central position in evolutionary biology — in biology as a whole, not just in evolutionary biology but in the whole of biology — that any important, new idea in biology has to be, to some extent, judged by its compatibility with, or its contradictions of, the Darwinian position.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean to give an earlier example, when at the beginning of this century, Mendel's laws of genetics were rediscovered and an enormous growth of genetics took place and indeed is still taking place, initially Mendelism was seen by it's practitioners and by biologists as a whole as a challenge to Darwinism, as an alternative to Darwin, and great fights took place for twenty years or so between the Darwinians and the Mendelians.<endOfText>
<human>I mean in retrospect, looking back on it, it seems crazy — since they were clearly both right, what were they arguing about? erm but it took a lot of time to see that these two sets of views could, in fact, be made compatible as we now think they can be.<endOfText>
<bot>Well what's the nature, then, of the challenge to Darwin today.<endOfText>
<human>There are a number of such challenges, but the interesting and I think significant one comes from a group of Palaeontologists, of whom Stephen Gould, now of Eldridge, erm and Stephen Stanley are probably the best know.<endOfText>
<bot>Who had  Stephen Gould has asserted that, as a result of the work of this group and others, a new, as he calls it, paradigm of evolutionary biology is in the making and the so-called near-Darwinist paradigm in which I was raised, and in which my students are raised  I suppose if I'm honest is, you know, due for the dustbin.<endOfText>
<human>erm well, what is it that this new paradigm attacks first of all?<endOfText>
<bot>Essentially it attacks Darwin's view that evolution is in its essence a gradual process.<endOfText>
<human>erm in a very interested book called Darwin on Man recently by a psychologist called Gruber, Gruber has argued that Darwin had a conviction which could be expressed by saying that things which are natural are necessarily gradual, and things which are sudden are miraculous and not natural, that he had this equation in his mind erm long before he erm became and evolutionist, long before he abandoned his belief in religion which he largely did later, and Gruber traces it back, interestingly enough, to the arguments of a theologian, Sumner, who later became an Archbishop, who  Darwin took notes on his ideas when he was a student at Cambridge erm which are still extent, and what Sumner had argued, among other things, was that a good argument for believing in the divinity of Christ, that Christ was divine rather than simply being a gifted teacher, was the suddenness with which the beliefs of the ancient world were transformed by Christ's teaching.<endOfText>
<bot>Now Darwin got from this this idea that somehow sudden things are miraculous, are natural, erm but admittedly they may happen but I mean there is a miraculous element about sudden things, whereas things that are natural should happen gradually, and he retained this view in spite of changing his ideas about all sorts of other things, and let us now see why the gradualism was so important a component of his theory of evolution.<endOfText>
<human>I mean we're all, I'm sure, basically family with what Darwin's theory of evolution is, and I don't really want to labour you by reminding you of it, but I think it's important to appreciate first of all what his problem was erm and I think that it's fair to say that for Darwin the problem was that as a naturalist he was aware of the fact that animals and plants are adapted to a quite extraordinary degree to their particular ways of life, and indeed many of his books on orchids and earthworms and so on have a great deal to say about the details of these adaptations.<endOfText>
<bot>His explanation of adaptation in a sense was that it occurred as a result, as he said, of the natural selection of variations which were in their origin non-adapted in some sense, random.<endOfText>
<human>And he felt that it would be in a sense a miracle to produce a detailed adaptation to a particular way of life, a kind of adaptation to being fertilized by bees that you see in an orchid, by a single a large jump.<endOfText>
<bot>If I can use erm an analogy of my own rather than of his, to produce erm a detailed adaptation of an organism to a specific way of life, if only large steps, large mutational changes were possible, would be a little like trying  a surgeon trying to remove erm an appendix with a scalpel mounted on some kind of trolley clamp with the rule that he couldn't move it less than a foot at a time.<endOfText>
<human>I mean he might occasionally want to move it a foot, but there would be no way he'd be able to make the nice adjustments in that way.<endOfText>
<bot>erm let me introduce you to — perhaps in a rather more quantitative way — let me introduce what is the sort of hoariest paradox about evolution.<endOfText>
<human>It's one that, you know, comes up year after year.<endOfText>
<bot>It is indeed actually the paradox that Fred Hoyle has just rediscovered erm which is  for those of us who have been teaching it to our undergraduates for thirty years.<endOfText>
<human>But the paradox goes like this — I mean any form of it is as follows: proteins, as most of you know, are strings of amino acids and we make a whole series of quite specific proteins.<endOfText>
<bot>Imagine a rather short one, a small one, a hundred amino acids long.<endOfText>
<human>There are twenty possible kinds of amino acid, so the number of different proteins a hundred amino acids long is twenty raised to the power of a hundred.<endOfText>
<bot>Now that is a fairly large number.<endOfText>
<human>Somebody calculated that if the surface of the earth was covered with a layer of protein molecules a metre thick, right over the whole surface of the earth erm each one, each protein different from every other one, and let us suppose furthermore that each of these proteins had been changing once as second, uniquely, into some different kind ever since the formation of the earth, we would still have tried out only quite a small fraction of the available possible proteins a hundred amino acids long.<endOfText>
<bot>you know <endOfText>
<human>erm the paradox then says how can evolution possibly lead by natural selection to the selection of just that protein which best performs some function if, just by a random process of mutation it might never happen in the first place.<endOfText>
<bot>That's the paradox.<endOfText>
<human>The answer is, of course, that that's not the way it happens.<endOfText>
<bot>Any old string of amino acids a hundred amino acids long will have some kind of enzymic activity pretty well, or at least a very great many of them will.<endOfText>
<human>If you just make random proteins a hundred amino acids they have some kind of catalytic activity — not much, but some.<endOfText>
<bot>We think evolution took place not by sort of hitting in one bang the right answer — that would be like the surgeon moving his scalpel a foot and hitting the right point, but by successive changes, changing one amino acid at a time, each change being a slight improvement on what was there before.<endOfText>
<human>And then if you do the sums there's no difficulty whatsoever in imagining the evolution of a specific optimal protein, one amino acid at a time, not in millions of years but even in thousands of years — it's not a serious mathematical problem.<endOfText>
<bot>But it's essentially, therefore, that natural selection is only going to produce adaptations if it can do so gradually, that's basically the guts of Darwin's position.<endOfText>
<human>erm now what then is the position  what is the nature of the criticism or the claims being made by the group of palaeontologists whom I'm going to refer to, for reasons that will become apparent, as the punctuations — because I mean they would call themselves punctuations.<endOfText>
<bot>In effect, they are making two claims, one of which I want to call the minor and the major claim, which are not logically necessarily following one from the other.<endOfText>
<human>The minor claim is simply that if you  it's an empirical claim  it says if you look at the fossil record, and you look in detail at the changes in the fossils, what you observe is not continuous steady change, but you see what they call stasis — that is nothing much happening for long periods of time, perhaps for millions of years, and then rather suddenly changes taking place.<endOfText>
<bot>erm whether that's true or not, I'll discuss the data on that in a moment, but that's a claim about what you actually see if you look at the fossil record.<endOfText>
<human>Stasis and then sudden change, which for reasons which do slightly defeat me, are called punctuational changes.<endOfText>
<bot>The major claim is a claim which has been expressed as the claim of de-coupling.<endOfText>
<human>The claim is that because of this feature of the fossil record the major features of evolution, the sort of trends that you see over hundreds of millions of years, are not merely a kind of adding together of the changes which go on by natural selection within populations and which we can study today, but that some quite different kind of process must be responsible for the major features of evolution, other than natural selection of variants within populations.<endOfText>
<bot>erm that then is the minor and the major claim being made erm let's now discuss whether there's any evidence for it erm or any evidence against it.<endOfText>
<human>erm let me consider first of all the minor claim, and here I think it's only fair to tell you that I'm not a palaeotologist.<endOfText>
<bot>What I know about palaeotology isn't too much  I mean I obviously have to try and know a bit, but it's not my field — erm in order to test the minor claim, you have to be able to get your hands on some rock which actually consists of continuous sedimentation over long periods of time.<endOfText>
<human>You don't want a bit of sedimentation and then a gap when nothing was being laid down and then a bit more being sedimented, because, you know, you don't know then whether the jumps you see in the record are simply there because there was a gap in deposition, or whether they really reflect the sudden change in the population.<endOfText>
<bot>erm the best candidate for that kind of deposit are deep see cores — I mean there's a continuous rain of stuff falling from the surface of the sea to the bottom of the sea and forming a great sort of ooze on the bottom and gradually compacting down into rock — cores of this stuff are now available and palaeontologists can look and see what happens.<endOfText>
<human>The fossils that they can see in such cores are mainly the fossils of single celled organisms, radiolarians,blobigurina , things of that kind, and the data I've seen published on this actually are pretty gradualist in their interpretation.<endOfText>
<bot>Changes do seem to occur remarkably steadily.<endOfText>
<human>They don't occur at a uniform rate, but there's nothing in Darwinism which implies that they should, but I was looking at some data on radiolarians recently in which about every sixty thousand years there's a population sample — I mean you can estimate and see the rate at which this stuff is building up — and in no occasion in a period of sixty thousand years did the population change by more than about half a standard deviation.<endOfText>
<bot>Now that's the kind of change that you can produce in the lab in five generations by artificial selection.<endOfText>
<human>So even the most rapid changes in these things were going very, very slowly compared with the kinds of rates which we're accustomed to seeing in the lab. erm so on the whole so far deep sea cores seem to me to suggest that really at least those beauties are really pretty gradualistic in their behaviour.<endOfText>
<bot>Let me now describe some work erm which points the other way.<endOfText>
<human>It's work I have some familiarity with because by accident I happened to be the external examiner of the lad who did it, Peter Williamson.<endOfText>
<bot>It's an admirable and exciting piece of work, I think, although I don't, and I must make this clear, altogether share Peter Williamson's interpretation of his own data.<endOfText>
<human>But what he has done has been to study twenty one species of freshwater molluscs — that means snails, clams, things of that kind from the Lake Tocarno region of Africa.<endOfText>
<bot>The reason why people are willing to spend money and time looking at the geology of Lake Tocarno of course is that some of our ancestors are lying around in the rocks and people are therefore very keen on getting accurate dating of the fossils and one way of doing that is to get erm accurate datings of changes in other fossils that you can co-ordinate with them.<endOfText>
<human>Williamson's got five million years of more or less continuous deposit, which he can date pretty accurately erm and he's got twenty one species of mollusc fossilised in that material.<endOfText>
<bot>erm he, although it's twenty one, fifteen do really damn all.<endOfText>
<human>I mean they are more or less the same at the end as they were at the beginning.<endOfText>
<bot>You certainly wouldn't want to put them in a different species, at least as far as you can judge from their shells.<endOfText>
<human>Of course that's all you can see.<endOfText>
<bot>And  they certainly demonstrate .<endOfText>
<human>The other six species erm all simultaneously show at one point in the record really rather sudden change.<endOfText>
<bot>What seems to have happened is that at that moment the water table in the Rift Valley fell, Lake Tocarno became isolated from the rest of the rift.<endOfText>
<human>Probably conditions in the lake changed, which is reasonable that they should have done.<endOfText>
<bot>Anyway, whether that's the reason or not, over a depth of about a metre of deposit there is really quite rapid changes in these populations.<endOfText>
<human>erm at the end of  a metre is difficult to be sure, but it's somewhere between ten thousand years and fifty thousand years in these deposits, to give you a rough idea of the kind of length of time we're talking about.<endOfText>
<bot>And at the end of that fifty thousand years, if that's what it is, the populations are sufficiently different that I'd think you'd want to put them into a different species if — I mean how are you to know, but I mean it's a reasonable judgement.<endOfText>
<human>erm then they stopped changing.<endOfText>
<bot>A little later erm the erm level of the lake rose again, became continuous with the rest of the rift, and almost instantaneously these new forms disappear and are replaced by the original form.<endOfText>
<human>All that means is that the original form was present in the rest of the Rift Valley during this period, never went extinct, and has now come into the lake again and has either made extinct, or in some other way swamped out the local form.<endOfText>
<bot>Now this is a very clear case of  punctuation.<endOfText>
<human>Nothing happening and then something happening, really pretty rapidly.<endOfText>
<bot>So it's admirable evidence for what I call the minor claim of the punctuationalist school, of the empirical claim.<endOfText>
<human>It doesn't prove that it's always true, but it's a jolly good case where it clearly, I think, is true.<endOfText>
<bot>erm I cannot see, and this is where I part company with Peter Williamson to some extent, I cannot see any reason why his data should be regarded as showing that when the sudden change did take place it took place for any reason other than natural selection within a single population.<endOfText>
<human>It's important that, for those of you sort of who are more into the sort of detailed  arguments that are going on, it's significant that whatever else was the case, this did not happen as a result of a single major mutation which was then established by selection, because Williamson's got lots of intermediate populations.<endOfText>
<bot>He's got the original population, then he's got a whole series of intermediates, then he's got an end population, so there is nothing  there are no hopeful monsters about.<endOfText>
<human>I'll talk about monsters in a minute.<endOfText>
<bot>Secondly, there's no reason to suppose it happened in a small population.<endOfText>
<human>Indeed it cannot have done if he can lay his hands on enough fossils just in a single surface exposure erm to be able to erm measure the properties of populations, it's clear there must have been millions of specimens of these beasts present at any one time in the lake.<endOfText>
<bot>So we're not talking about small population either.<endOfText>
<human>So it seems to me that what Williamson has shown in one particular case is clear evidence of  punctuation, but no reasons at all that I can see for supposing that the mechanism of change was any other which Darwin described over a hundred years ago.<endOfText>
<bot>erm just a word or two about the erm question of erm changes of rate and what was Darwin's attitude himself towards this issue.<endOfText>
<human>erm Darwin says in the origin, and I'm sorry I can't read it to you, but I was desperately looking for the quotation in the origin before I can and I couldn't find it but  I assure you it's there erm in which he remarks that in all probability the periods of time during which species are not changing is probably very large compared with those periods when change is taking place.<endOfText>
<bot>In other words, hopefully,expects punctuation to be the case anyway.<endOfText>
<human>So there's particularly unDarwinian about this finding.<endOfText>
<bot>erm what would be unDarwinian would be if there was, so to speak, a sudden break between one species and another, without any intermediate having existed.<endOfText>
<human>erm now the strongest reason, I think, for believing that that is not the case is that it doesn't come from the fossil record, it comes simply from looking at organisms today.<endOfText>
<bot>If you look at sexually reproducing organisms, and you don't move about too much — erm I mean you just sit in Sussex and look at the birds — then by and large you don't have any doubt at all to what species any particular belongs.<endOfText>
<human>I mean blue tits is blue tits and great tits is great tits and you don't see any intermediates.<endOfText>
<bot>erm so species are, in a sense, real things out there, they're not an artefact of taxonomists who've tried to force some classification onto organisms which don't really have that nature.<endOfText>
<human>If, on the other hand, you travel about this ceases to be true.<endOfText>
<bot>It ceases to be true of the great tit as a matter of fact, because if you follow populations of the great tits westward across Europe, the Middle East and Northern India into Southern China, they gradually change and become smaller and darker.<endOfText>
<human>If, instead of following them that way you follow them a bit further north and follow them north of the Himalayas, then get smaller and greyer and paler, and the two ends of the loop meet in China and behave as distinct species.<endOfText>
<bot>They don't hybridize.<endOfText>
<human>I mean if one was talking about great tits in China, you'd have to say there are two kinds of great tits.<endOfText>
<bot>So you've got a continuous series of forms erm but at the ends of the ring the erm two species are behaving as good species and as distinct, and at what point could you say there's been a sudden break.<endOfText>
<human>Well clearly at no point.<endOfText>
<bot>In case this surprises you, and I'm sure it doesn't surprise those of you who are biologists, we have in Britain two terminal links with such a chain, which we would never regard as anything other than perfectly good species.<endOfText>
<human>Those are the herring gull and the lesser black-backed gull, which are two terminal links in a series of forms which sort of form a ring around the pole.<endOfText>
<bot>So, geographical variation doesn't lead one to have any kind of impression that the boundaries between species are sharp and distinct if you move about.<endOfText>
<human>If you stay in the same place then the whole process of sexual reproduction means that indeed there are uniform populations which are hybridizing with one another and then barriers to other hybridizing population, but not if you move about.<endOfText>
<bot>And one of the most ironic features of the present debate as a matter of fact is that Steve Gould, who's been the most vocal exponent of the punctuationist view, and indeed of the view that there's something really quite special about the specification of them, his own field work is concerned with a mollusc snail called serin erm from the West Indies, which, when it was first described by anatomists, was classified into several genera and several hundreds of different species.<endOfText>
<human>That's what you'd think about it if you look at it as a piece of morphology, the shell shape — it turns out to be all one species with gene flow, hybridization right across the lot.<endOfText>
<bot>Now how a man who works  on  can think there's anything funny about species I just can't understand erm but there it is. erm well, suppose, however, that in my view wrongly one did suppose that there was something erm in this sort of idea of the decoupling between the processes which we observed in single populations and erm the sort of mechanisms leading to large scale evolution, what kinds of processes are held to be important when it comes to large scale evolution events?<endOfText>
<human>Well I want, very briefly, to mention three.<endOfText>
<bot>And first I want to discuss this idea of hopeful monsters, which is a phrase which goes back to Richard Goldsmith, the geneticist, who argued that occasionally a single — well he was vague about what kind of mutation he had in mind, because he had really rather odd ideas about what genes were and so on but he held occasionally that some genetic change gave rise in some sense in a single dialectical leap to organisms strikingly different from their parents and that speciation consisted of the establishment of such hopeful monsters or macro mutations.<endOfText>
<human>He didn't say all large mutations were hopeful, but that just occasionally one would be.<endOfText>
<bot>erm I must confess I've always had rather a soft spot for macro mutations, I don't know why, it may have had something to do with Goldsmith's prose, which is sort of rather moving when you get into it, erm and partly, and this is an  interesting comment as an aside, that I knew as an undergraduate that to argue in favour of Goldsmith would make my teachers in general, and Professor J B S Halldane in particular , exceedingly angry and making one's teachers angry is, after all, one of the activities into which undergraduates should occasionally go.<endOfText>
<human>So I used to support Goldsmith's views, perhaps rather more strongly than I actually should of done.<endOfText>
<bot>Anyway, I've always had a soft spot for this, there's no problem about the existence of large morphological changes due to a single mutation.<endOfText>
<human>I mean any visit to a gesopholar laboratory will persuade you some very, very striking differences, you know, like having four wings instead of two, or even four legs instead of six I've had in the lab — you know, really quite striking differences can be due to a single Mendelising gene, no problem about that.<endOfText>
<bot>The question at issue is not whether macro mutations take place, but whether they form the basis of evolutionary novelties erm and that's an empirical question which is not easy to answer.<endOfText>
<human>It seems fairly clear, for example, that in domestic animals macro mutations of this kind have quite often been made the basis of new breeds of dogs or of cattle and things of that kind.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm thinking of polled cattle or dogs with very, very short muzzles or dwarf legs and so on.<endOfText>
<human>What tends to happen is you pick up a large mutation and then you modify it further, further modifying selection.<endOfText>
<bot>So there's nothing erm sorry,I mean, I wouldn't regard erm, you know, the acceptance of hopeful monsters in any sense as an occasional event in evolution is any sense particularly strange.<endOfText>
<human>The question is does it actually happen?<endOfText>
<bot>And that's, of course, very hard to decide.<endOfText>
<human>The only way I can think of, or I think as far as anyone else can think of, deciding whether it has in fact been important in speciation, is to look for pairs of closely related species which differ in some striking morphological trait, but are still sufficiently similar genetically for you to be able to carry out a genetic analysis, i.e. to cross them, to get offspring, to get F two's and it's then possible, it's obviously not — I'm not going to explain the details of the technique to you now — but it's possible to work out whether the difference is due largely, or in part, to some single large gene, or whether it's on the whole due to quite a lot of small ones.<endOfText>
<bot>And when species differ in colour pattern, for example, it not at all infrequently turns out that it's just one gene, or perhaps a couple erm I mean trituris marmaratis , which is rather a nice green newt,christatus , which is rather a nice black and yellow spotted newt, you can hybridize them and the difference is due to a single gene as far as the colour is concerned  gene.<endOfText>
<human>But when you're thinking about an morphological traits, shapes, characters and so on, what evidence we have — and it's nothing like enough, it would be nice to have more — what evidence we have suggests that, as a matter of fact, the differences are not due to hopeful monsters.<endOfText>
<bot>The nice investigation recently of a erm pair of species of gesophola , these are Hawaiian gesophola , in which one species, the males, have sort of eyes like crabs stuck out almost on stalks.<endOfText>
<human>I don't want you to imagine a great big long stalk, you know, but I mean they really do have a big projection from the side of the head in gesophola hetroinura , whereas in the known ancestor of that,gesopholis ulvestris , it's head is just the same shape as any other sensible fruit fly.<endOfText>
<bot>erm you can hybridize these two, you can second generations, backcrosses and so on, the analysis has been made, and we know that there isn't a single large gene producing that effect — we know that there are quite a number of genes of reasonably small effect, we don't know exactly how many but certainly it doesn't look like a hopeful monster.<endOfText>
<human>But of course one case doesn't prove anything; we'd like more.<endOfText>
<bot>erm secondly, I want to say just a word about an idea that Gould, in particular, and Stanley had been fond of, namely the idea of species selection.<endOfText>
<human>erm the idea of species selection is basically this.<endOfText>
<bot>The idea is that species originate by the sudden events, whatever they may be, and they have new characteristics, which  randomly related to the characteristics of their ancestral species.<endOfText>
<human>erm they're rather like sort of mutations are randomly related to the gene from which the mutation took place, but now we're talking about a whole species suddenly arising with a new randomly arranged set of traits, and then the wholesale direction of evolution erm is determined by selection favouring some species in competition with other species.<endOfText>
<bot>So the unit of evolution ceases to be the individual who survives and reproduces in competition with another individual that becomes a species as a whole which survives in competition with other species.<endOfText>
<human>erm I think that this is unlikely both on quantisation and actually also on  curiously enough actually on logical grounds.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's consider first of all the quantitative ground, erm and let's talk about one of the major transitions, one of the major origins about which we have some information, and that is the origin of the mammals from the reptiles. erm we have quite a lot of fossils erm erm from the permian up to the triassic erm of mammals and their reptilian ancestors, and we know pretty well what went on.<endOfText>
<human>erm some of the changes that took place were concerned with learning to chew.<endOfText>
<bot>You see mammals can chew and reptiles can't, erm we can chump away, you know? erm and let me just list some of the changes that took place which help us to chew.<endOfText>
<human>The most critical one in some ways is a change in the structure of our lower jaw, so instead of having a lot of bones in our lower jaw we have just a single bone in our lower jaw, the dentory , which articulates with a bone called the scremosal , whereas in reptiles the quadrate and articular for the articulation and those bones have now got stuck into our inner ear and do some stuff about conducting sound impulses.<endOfText>
<bot>And one can follow those changes step by step through the fossil record erm including some rather nice fossils we now have which have both jaw articulations in parallel.<endOfText>
<human>They have both the reptilian one and the mammalian one, both sort of functional.<endOfText>
<bot>erm at the same time, the bones on the side of the skull got sort of gradually disappeared, so that when you clench your jaws there's got somewhere for the muscles out to bulge out to, supposing you've got big muscles.<endOfText>
<human>Then, very important for people like me, we developed a secondary palette, who's function is to allow you to eat and talk at the same time <endOfText>
<bot>but it also enables to you to eat and breathe at the same time.<endOfText>
<human>You see you can't go chewing away, it  unless you've got a bony ridge between the bit you're chewing and where the air pipe is, which a reptile doesn't have — most reptiles don't, crocodiles do.<endOfText>
<bot>Then we evolved a single tooth replacement, so that first of all you have milk teeth and then you have adult teeth, instead of them dropping out all the time.<endOfText>
<human>That's bad when you run out of teeth, like me, but <endOfText>
<bot>but it's erm it does mean that you can, so to speak, design your teeth as a sort of decent engineering job and make them fit with one another and slide over one another and grind and so on.<endOfText>
<human>So, along with single tooth replacement, you get differentiation of the tooth rap , so that you get canines and incisors and molars and all sorts of different nicely  and complicated teeth.<endOfText>
<bot>Then there are a lot of changes that went place  took place in locomotion. erm mammals, in other words, learnt to gallop and their elbows rotated backwards and their knees rotated forwards.<endOfText>
<human>Their backbone changed so that it would bend in a vertical plane erm the limb girdles changes and a whole number of other things changed associated with locomotion.<endOfText>
<bot>Then a number of things we can't follow in the fossil record, but we know must have happened.<endOfText>
<human>They became homoiothermic, erm warm blooded, the developed hair and so on.<endOfText>
<bot>They developed a double circulation — they changed the method of circulating the blood round the body.<endOfText>
<human>erm some of us, but not all of us, started lactating <endOfText>
<bot>and feeding our young that way, and some of us  but again not all of us, became volviferous and actually brought forth our young alive.<endOfText>
<human>All those changes must have been happening in parallel with these other ones.<endOfText>
<bot>Now that's a lot of changes.<endOfText>
<human>If you try to do the sums and ask could you do all those changes simply by sort of species  going one way and the other relative to these changes erm in their origins and then those species which happen to be in the right direction being selection by some kind of species selection, I think the answer is you just can't make the sums add up right.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean there just weren't enough species extinctions to enable you to produce that number of changes and a number of independent traits in that length of time.<endOfText>
<human>Quantitative arguments of that kind are always hard to pin down solidly, but I don't think it's numerically plausible that you could produce a set of changes of that kind by species selection.<endOfText>
<bot>Also, it sort of there's something wrong with it logically.<endOfText>
<human>Ask yourself who chews, who gallops?<endOfText>
<bot>A species does not chew or gallop.<endOfText>
<human>The species horse doesn't chew or gallop or jump or bring forth its young alive.<endOfText>
<bot>Individual horses chew, gallop, etc.<endOfText>
<human>If anybody  if anything survives because it can chew better or gallop better or bring forth it's young alive or has a better circulation, it's not the species.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean it's the individual animals that have these properties are the ones that survive.<endOfText>
<human>I mean there is a real sense in which species selection just doesn't make sense in this kind of context.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, as a matter fact I do think that there are contexts in which species selection does make sense.<endOfText>
<human>I mean let me mention one — the chairman mentioned that I was a rash enough to write a book on the evolution of sex.<endOfText>
<bot>Now one of the things that sex  one of the consequences of sex is that a population which reproduces sexually can evolve more rapidly than a population erm which reproduces asexually.<endOfText>
<human>Now that trait could well be favoured by species selection, because what is it that evolves — individuals do not evolve — we are born and we die, but we don't evolve.<endOfText>
<bot>Populations and species evolve.<endOfText>
<human>So sex and the capacity to evolve rapidly is a property of the species, not of an individual erm and consequently once can visualize erm species selection being responsible for it's evolution, so I don't actually have much taste for species selection.<endOfText>
<bot>I can't see the point.<endOfText>
<human>The last set of ideas which I want to discuss, which is not  which are only partly related as a matter of fact to the erm ideas of the punctuationists, are the ideas, which, as a matter of fact my colleagues here Brian Goodwin and Gerry Webster have been particularly clear and eloquent advocates, which say in effect that if you really want to understand evolution, merely thinking about the adaptation of organisms to some kind of environment is not really an adequate way of thinking about it, because when you look at organisms, look at vertebrates for example, you'll find an astonishing range of kinds of ways of life.<endOfText>
<bot>They have an underlying community of pattern.<endOfText>
<human>erm the  I mean we have a pentadactyl limb, whether we climb or run or fly or swim, you can recognise an obvious deep anatomical resemblance between the limbs of organisms behaving as differently as that, and therefore that if we really want to understand evolution we have to understand these erm, I don't know whether one wants to call them  plans or archetypes, or structures, call them what you will.<endOfText>
<bot>And the theory of evolution which doesn't properly understand the nature of these structures is really a jolly incomplete theory.<endOfText>
<human>Now, let me say there's one component of what Brian and Gerry have been saying, which I most passionately agree with as it happens  — get that bit off my chest first — and that is that until we have a clear understanding of the mechanisms and processes of development, the processes whereby an egg turns into an adult, our theory of evolution will, indeed, be very imperfect, and we do not have such a theory, erm it's exceedingly important that we should work on such a theory, and such a theory it isn't sufficient simply to say ‘Oh well, there's a genetic programme for development’ and  imagine that in other ways actually said something, because you actually haven't.<endOfText>
<bot>You haven't said anything very useful anyhow.<endOfText>
<human>erm however, what about these ? erm let me read you what Darwin had to say erm about  and this in fact is erm erm the end of chapter six of The Origin of Species.<endOfText>
<bot>He wrote ‘It is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been formed on two great lines, unity of type and the conditions of existence.<endOfText>
<human>By unity of type is meant that fundamental agreement in structure which we see in organic beings of the same class, and which is quite independent of their habits of life.<endOfText>
<bot>On my theory, unity of type is explained by unity of dissent.<endOfText>
<human>The expression of conditions of existence, so often insisted on by the illustrious Cuvier, is fully embraced by the principle of natural selection.<endOfText>
<bot>For natural selection acts by either now adapting the various parts of each being to its conditions of life, or by having adapted them during long past periods of time’.<endOfText>
<human>And he finishes ‘Hence, in fact, the law of the conditions of existence is the higher law, as it includes, through the inheritance of former adaptations, that of unity of type’.<endOfText>
<bot>Now it's jolly difficult to follow an argument of that time when it's read — I appreciate that — but what I think Darwin is actually saying is this, that it's true that vertebrates, for example— all vertebrates, from fish to ourselves — have a common pattern of a rigid rod down the middle of the back, segmented muscles either side of it, a mouth at the front, a hollow nerve chord on top, two pairs of fins or legs derived from them, but not three pairs or one pair, but two pairs and so on .<endOfText>
<human>It's true that that is a common feature really from the time of  for the last five hundred million years, from the time of the earliest fish to ourselves and to the birds and everybody else, but it's like that not because there is some kind of profound law of form, which says that's the kind of organism which is in  permitted by the laws of development to arise, erm I mean the law form would be something like erm a law of physics which says that if objects move round the sun they're going to do so in ellipses with the sun at one focus.<endOfText>
<bot>That's a kind of law of the form of movement of planets.<endOfText>
<human>Now, could there be comparable laws which say certain kinds of organisms are possible? erm and among those possible kinds of organisms are organisms built on this vertebrae pattern.<endOfText>
<bot>And there are other kinds of organisms which really just aren't possible, and that's why you don't find them.<endOfText>
<human>Darwin's in effect in this passage is saying no, I don't think that's so at all, I think that this common pattern that all vertebrates have is simple the adaptive features of the common ancestor of the vertebrates, and I think he's got a jolly good case.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean why do you want to have a rigid rod down the middle of your back and segmented muscles down either side?<endOfText>
<human>Well every biologist knows why you want to do that, it's so you can swim sinusoidally like a fish.<endOfText>
<bot>You  may say I don't swim sinusoidally like a fish — you're quite right, but it's not why you have them, it's why your ancestors had them.<endOfText>
<human>And you may say well why do I have two pairs of fins, you know, one in front and one behind, instead of, say, three pairs of fins, or one pair of fins, or eight pairs of fins — why do we all have two?<endOfText>
<bot>Again perfectly good adaptive reasons — they have two pairs of fins for the same reason that sensible aeroplanes, i.e. the aeroplanes that I used to design before people went crazy, have a wing in the front and a tailplane behind, and basically they do so because two surfaces — one in front of the other like that — is the minimum number of surfaces needed if you want to produce a vertical force through any point along your body.<endOfText>
<human>You can't do it with one, it's too few, and you don't need three, so you do it with two.<endOfText>
<bot>erm to go to another famous bio-plan, I pondered for a time about why does the bio-plan of insects insist on having six legs, after all we don't have six legs, why do insects have six legs?<endOfText>
<human>Well, the reason why they have six legs, if you think about it, is exceedingly simple, and it's again a perfectly good adaptive reason.<endOfText>
<bot>It's nothing to do with laws of form.<endOfText>
<human>It's simply that six legs is the smallest number of legs you can have such that you can take exactly half of them off the ground and not fall over.<endOfText>
<bot>And if you look at an insect walking, that's exactly what it does.<endOfText>
<human>It's not clever like us, falling over all the time.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean when we're walking we are actually falling the whole time, but insects are not like that, they don't stand on three and pick up the other three.<endOfText>
<human>When I first thought of that I suddenly got in an absolute panic — nothing to do with Darwin, but, you know never mind — and I thought what about those erm , preying mantises and things, which  who have adopted their front legs for sort of seizing prey like that  they've even got four legs to walk on — what do the poor things do?<endOfText>
<bot>So I went rushing round to a friend of mine who fortunately had some and I said I want to see your  walking, and I was much comforted to discover that they do actually use all six legs.<endOfText>
<human>They walk on their knees and the front legs like this, so they stand on a knee and then those two legs, and then that knee and these two legs, so they <endOfText>
<bot>The basic point I am making is I, you know, and this is quite unfair.<endOfText>
<human>Next week we must have Brian or Gerry telling  you why I'm wrong and they'd be as persuasive, or more persuasive than I'm being, but I can't see the case for such a thing as a law of form.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that animal forms could be almost infinitely varied and the actual forms you see are the forms which Darwin led us to see, namely the forms which are adapted to particular and specific ways of life.<endOfText>
<human>Of course it leaves a problem unsolved.<endOfText>
<bot>It leaves it unsolved, but all right, given that our ancestors had this because they wanted to swim sinusoidally and eat, you know, filter feed and do things like that, we don't swim sinusoidally and filter feed  why on earth do we  are we so conservative?<endOfText>
<human>And I've no doubt at all that the answer to that question has to lie in an understanding of the mechanics of development.<endOfText>
<bot>If it wasn't that we had to develop from an egg in every generation, I don't think that kind of conservatism would be observed.<endOfText>
<human>So I do think the development at that level has something pretty profound to say.<endOfText>
<bot>erm I'm conscious of the fact that I've been going on for perhaps too long and I may not have said quite enough about Darwin, but let me just finish by saying this  that it's not possible today, I believe, to discuss any important problem in biology without Darwin's thought being absolutely central to what you're saying all the time.<endOfText>
<human>I mean biologists , when they're talking to one another, are, by and large , talking about Darwin and that's what I've been trying to do.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, ladies and gentlemen, I think you'll agree that some of John Maynard-Smith's early engineering training showed through, as it were, in reverse order, if that's not too heretical a statement to make in this context, in the gentle good natured demolition job that he did on the main current critical attacks on Darwin's mechanism, and particularly on the rhythms of change that Darwin adumbrated within his own time scale.<endOfText>
<human>I think that with John Maynard-Smith around — and I hope he'll be around for some time yet in the University of Sussex, and I hope the University of Sussex will be too <endOfText>
<bot>In these circumstances I think that Darwin can rest quietly in his grave, that is to say of the acidulous palaeontologists haven't already been trying to dig him up to prove something.<endOfText>
<human>As John Maynard-Smith knows, I've always been, in a less expert way than he, a Darwinist and I've always felt, and you exemplified that tonight, I think, John, the beauty if the situation was that these profound theories corresponded with what a man of good sense, rationality, unswayed by prejudice and emotion, would be bound to belief when faced with the evidence.<endOfText>
<bot>And I think as far as the critics are concerned, John Maynard-Smith may allow me to adapt erm the critical misjudgement of all time, which was made by a Dublin Professor when The Origin of Species first came out, which you will remember no doubt <endOfText>
<human>when she said  when she said that what was new in the theory was false, and what was true was old.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that John has suggested that much of what the critics are now getting up to, where it's new it's false, and where it is true, it's already subsumed in Darwin's theory as modified by John Maynard-Smith.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you very much, John.<endOfText>
<bot>Hello.<endOfText>
<human>We're always being told that what this country needs is more scientists, but often something seems to go wrong at school.<endOfText>
<bot>When children are thirteen or fourteen instead of being excited and stimulated by subjects such as physics and chemistry, they're bored by them, and many of the brightest minds turn away to history or english, the arts and humanities.<endOfText>
<human>Sandy Grassie is physicist at the university — an enthusiast who likes to share his keen sense of adventure in physics with young people.<endOfText>
<bot>Sandy, tell me about your physics master classes for young people.<endOfText>
<human>Well to a certain extent these are a development of master classes that were running in mathematics across the country.<endOfText>
<bot>The Royal Institution had tried this and they would have a set of Saturday mornings where they had mathematicians talking to children of about thirteen or fourteen.<endOfText>
<human>They felt it would be a good idea if they extended these ideas to the subject of physics, and we were asked at the university to try for the very first time to run a set of these master classes for children aged thirteen to fourteen in physics, to see if we could transmit some of the excitement and pleasure of doing physics to children at that crucial stage in their scientific development in schools.<endOfText>
<bot>Where do the children come from?<endOfText>
<human>The children come from East and West Sussex, although to my astonishment there's one who comes from the far reaches of West Sussex, right away over erm the other side of Chichester.<endOfText>
<bot>She travels in every Saturday morning.<endOfText>
<human>The parents bring her in, and the catchment are Horsham, Worth Abbey, Crawley, Oldbourne.<endOfText>
<bot>Going eastwards into East Sussex, not so far out, mainly Lewes, Newhaven, Brighton area.<endOfText>
<human>And they are put forward by the schools themselves?<endOfText>
<bot>They are put forward by the schools through the local authorities, except that of course there are a large number of independent schools in East and West Sussex, and these schools have  I wrote to these ones asking if they had any children that they wanted to nominate.<endOfText>
<human>Roughly speaking, there are thirty six children in the class — what is it, it's thirteenish from East Sussex, thirteenish from West Sussex and nine from the independent sector spread across the county.<endOfText>
<bot>And what are you trying to do with these children?<endOfText>
<human>Quite simply, give them an exciting perspective of what the ideas of physics are.<endOfText>
<bot>We're trying to do things which  on many occasions we're actually doing things which are done at university with them, in a simplified form, of course, but just to give them this perspective, this view of physics.<endOfText>
<human>It happens that what we've done is we've taken it and hung it on the starlight, the magic of starlight — how wonderful it is, how much you can tell from just looking at a star through a telescope and measuring the light that comes out of it, and this takes us into realms of why a star shines; what do you mean by time when you go back millions of years into the universe lifetime; what do you mean, why do stars shine with different colours.<endOfText>
<bot>These kinds of things.<endOfText>
<human>It's not an obvious cumulative line through O level, it's more an impression of probably things that they will come across over the next seven years just to transmit the fun and the excitement.<endOfText>
<bot>They get lectures each Saturday morning?<endOfText>
<human>Every Saturday morning there's a lecture, yes, a lecture which is given by a member of the university faculty, one of my colleagues.<endOfText>
<bot>A rather unusual lecture, because in devising these lectures we've actually worked with local school teachers in working out what we can say to these thirteen to fourteen year old kids, because of course in university circles usually one's dealing with pupils, students, eighteen, nineteen, twenty and post-graduates.<endOfText>
<human>We haven't that much experience of working with thirteen to fourteen year olds, so we have been collaborating closely with the teachers in devising what could go into each lecture.<endOfText>
<bot>They do practical work?<endOfText>
<human>Experiments?<endOfText>
<bot>They do experiments, not experiments to find out about things, but experiments to demonstrate things.<endOfText>
<human>They're not really finding out about the uttermost regions of the hydrogen atom.<endOfText>
<bot>What we're doing is showing them the colour of light, the hydrogen spectrum that's given off and asking them to make some measurements on it which give a clue to the nature of what is happening in hydrogen.<endOfText>
<human>They are experiments, for instance, that our undergraduates do in their first year here, tailored down very, very severely to act as demonstration experiments for these children.<endOfText>
<bot>How could these children possibly do undergraduate experiments at the age of thirteen?<endOfText>
<human>Well from the hubbub when they're doing it, they're obviously enjoying it.<endOfText>
<bot>Handling apparatus, that's also fun.<endOfText>
<human>Handling apparatus is good fun for them — unusual apparatus, doing the experiments, taking readings, plotting graphs is fun.<endOfText>
<bot>We have written very carefully descriptive material of what is really happening in the experiment and then a very succinct set of instructions — do this, do that, turn the left hand knob.<endOfText>
<human>Of course that isn't all that's involved in doing physics, not at all— there are other aspects of actually having ideas about physics, but in the time they will see some pattern emerging within that experiment.<endOfText>
<bot>They're not doing it on their own, they're doing it in groups of three on each experiment — three people will be arguing, working together on one experiment.<endOfText>
<human>There will be around in the room when they're doing this any six research students who have experience with the equipment, and a lecturer, and the school teacher who was involved in planning that day's work.<endOfText>
<bot>You set the a great egg race type topic to work on for three weeks.<endOfText>
<human>How did that work out?<endOfText>
<bot>Well it was great fun.<endOfText>
<human>We certainly set it because if the kids do spend all their time doing these demonstration experiments they're sure to get bored — life is like that.<endOfText>
<bot>The great egg race experiment was something to break into the Midlands, something to ask them to have opinions about puzzles, because there's an awful lot of science in schools which precludes you from having an opinion.<endOfText>
<human>You carry on learning, and somewhere somebody knows the answer to it so you learn how they go the answer to it, and then perhaps later on you have a chance to have an opinion in science.<endOfText>
<bot>We thought it would be a good idea to give them a chance straight off to have an opinion, and we set them a nice problem, which was that they put a marble into something and another marble comes out thirty seconds later.<endOfText>
<human>They had a large box of miscellaneous bit and pieces of sticky tape and straws and wood and drawing pins and all sorts of things, and we essentially just left them for two weeks to do this — and they came up with some superb ideas.<endOfText>
<bot>There was some problem that one of them went back and talked to, presumably dad, perhaps mum though, erm and came back with a lovely engineered solution, but that didn't matter — they had fun doing it and they had fun trying these things and, believe me, the answer were ever so close to what the design  I was amazed with what they produced.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I was there erm and saw them working, and I think you were looking fairly amazed that the answer came out to be almost the correct answer on several occasions, with quite different bits of apparatus.<endOfText>
<bot>Quite, it's amazing.<endOfText>
<human>It hadn't thought.<endOfText>
<bot>I had honestly not thought how you would solve that problem in advance, and I'm glad I did because my amazement  certainly I wanted it to show with the kids when I said ‘Goodness, what, you know, how on earth are you going to do it that way?’.<endOfText>
<human>It really was  I was quite astonished to see some of the solutions.<endOfText>
<bot>One of the nice aspects of a task such as that is that I think we, as professional physicists — and I'm a physicist too  erm we, as professional physicists, feel there's a right way of doing something because it's the way we learnt and we've got used to, and we tend to instil this idea into other people.<endOfText>
<human>And I think it was really rather refreshing to see the kids not know what was the right idea and actually dream up all sorts of fantasies for themselves, many of which were  had their own validity.<endOfText>
<bot>They really did.<endOfText>
<human>I think this is an extremely important point in the teaching.<endOfText>
<bot>I think one of the difficulties of science — you talked at the beginning of switching people off science — is there are some golden opportunities when you can argue science, you can argue politics, you can argue English Literature with your teacher — it's very hard to argue mathematics with your teacher.<endOfText>
<human>It's hard also to argue physics and chemistry with your teacher.<endOfText>
<bot>I'd like to find some examples of that and to give the kids chances to talk and to argue their ideas where there isn't some mammoth answer stacked up on the shelves of a library somewhere.<endOfText>
<human>There are a lot of simple problems where kids can actually have opinions.<endOfText>
<bot>Sandy, are you finding any difference between the boys and girls in the way they're reacting to your experiments and course?<endOfText>
<human>No, no difference whatsoever.<endOfText>
<bot>All of them enthusiastic — questions are coming think and fast, not at the end of a lecture — I think we actually slightly dominate them because we're not school teachers, but quote with a big U ‘University lecturers’, but get them down in the laboratory and the questions come thick and fast from boys and girls — no difference whatsoever.<endOfText>
<human>So it's too young at the moment for the girls to feel that they can't do science.<endOfText>
<bot>They haven't been put off science, they haven't decided that it's unwomanlike, or unladylike to be a scientist?<endOfText>
<human>You're right.<endOfText>
<bot>This group, however, are slightly specially selected.<endOfText>
<human>These are selected children from the schools — often perhaps the best in the class — that have been put forward.<endOfText>
<bot>They're very determined.<endOfText>
<human>Further down the line the rot may have set in.<endOfText>
<bot>These are people who are enthusiastic about science that we're transferring more enthusiasm to, to reinforce their interest in science.<endOfText>
<human>I am a bit worried about the ones further down the line, how we influence them.<endOfText>
<bot>Sandy, what's going to happen to these kids when they go back to their dull, boring school laboratories and classes after having seen the vision of your course and what physics can possibly be in the future?<endOfText>
<human>Well we know, from talking to some of the school teachers involved, they go back and  the kids go back and talk to the other kids in the form.<endOfText>
<bot>They may have a slight perturbation on the behaviour of the school teachers, because they're going to come back with some ideas which the school teachers will find slightly foreign to them.<endOfText>
<human>For instance, in one of the lectures we were talking about how you know how heavy an atom is, and my colleague, Mike Pendlebury, was describing how you can actually do this by weighing a crystal and counting the number of atoms in it, erm this is certainly not the traditional way, it's a way that's been developed over the last few years.<endOfText>
<bot>It's a beautiful, simple way of doing it.<endOfText>
<human>It's not at all in the general knowledge of the sixth form science teacher, or certainly not of the O level science teacher.<endOfText>
<bot>Some of them are going to have to puzzle a little bit hard.<endOfText>
<human>I do worry slightly that if some child answers this in an O level exam paper in, what, let's see, two years time, that they may get marked down.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think that's a serious problem, but it nonetheless is the fact that this is now the method of measuring  of weighing atoms.<endOfText>
<human>You don't hurl them through space and put them through an electric field and a magnetic field and the rest of it.<endOfText>
<bot>The accuracy comes from literally counting the number of atoms in a single crystal of silicone and weighing it.<endOfText>
<human>Sandy, this is the first of these courses that you've run, and I deliberately said first of these courses — do you have any plans for running future courses?<endOfText>
<bot>It seems a great idea and it's a shame only to have one of them.<endOfText>
<human>I think that'll depend on where the money comes from.<endOfText>
<bot>It always looms large.<endOfText>
<human>These courses are funded by Shell, and we're very grateful for their help.<endOfText>
<bot>They're quite expensive at the outset because what we've got to do is pay the lecturers to put a lot of work in on those lectures — it's not a simple thing writing this lecture for a thirteen year old  and we also pay the school teachers for coming along and helping the lecturers.<endOfText>
<human>Provided Shell were willing, we probably would go ahead next year, although the question you could ask is, having helped a group of thirty six kids in Sussex this year, shouldn't Shell, if they were going to run these master classes, help a group of kids in Westmorland next year, rather than another group down in Sussex next year.<endOfText>
<bot>It's very much up in the air about the continuation of these classes.<endOfText>
<human>Remember this is the very first class.<endOfText>
<bot>Between Christmas and New Year, sitting writing the notes for this course, I was very twitchy about how successful it would be, and now quite happy talking to the children and school teachers and listening to the hubbub of questions and pleasure as they do it, that the thing is working.<endOfText>
<human>It seems to have worked very well, and congratulations Sandy.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you very much for talking to us about it.<endOfText>
<human>That's all that we have time for today.<endOfText>
<bot>My guest today is Sir Richard Attenbrough, or Dickie to his many friends.<endOfText>
<human>Actor, film maker, entrepreneur, he's a many of many parts, including, for example, an association for the past seventeen or eighteen years with the University of Sussex.<endOfText>
<bot>I think it was Oh What a Lovely War that I first remember seeing you round about the university.<endOfText>
<human>Was that your first contact with us?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, it was.<endOfText>
<human>What I can't actually remember is whether Lovely War preceded  my son and daughter came to Sussex.<endOfText>
<bot>I remember Michael.<endOfText>
<human>And I can't remember — I think Michael must have come after A Lovely War, or maybe contemporary with it, I'm not sure.<endOfText>
<bot>But it was about then — you're absolutely right — about that time, about nineteen sixty nine, nineteen seventy.<endOfText>
<human>It was simply that we were shooting the picture down in Brighton on the front to a large extent and on the rubbish dump, I remember, which we turned into the fields of northern France, and we needed that terrible phrase from the First World War, cannon fodder.<endOfText>
<bot>We needed young men who were dragooned into the services in the fourteen/eighteen war and erm who never came back, and we needed a lot of them.<endOfText>
<human>And we provided them.<endOfText>
<bot>And the university provided them, greatly goosed on, I might say, by the then Vice Chancellor Aisa Briggs, who was very excited by the project, and that's really how I came to be connected with the university.<endOfText>
<human>And not many years later than that you were involved with the Gardener Centre in one of its previous incarnations, if I could put it that way.<endOfText>
<bot>Chairman of the Board, weren't you?<endOfText>
<human>Yes I was.<endOfText>
<bot>It was again Aisa Briggs who said now come on, you know, we've helped you with the movie, come and do some work for the university, and I didn't need any encouragement.<endOfText>
<human>I mean it seemed to me that the whole concept of an Arts Centre of that stature and calibre on campus was simply marvellous — not unique, but of a very remarkable concept — and I became, as you say, Chairman of the Gardener Centre through Aisa Briggs' persuasion.<endOfText>
<bot>A very persuasive man.<endOfText>
<human>Oh very, oh very, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>And since then you've gone your own way and the Gardener Centre's gone its own way and it's, to be honest, gone down and up and down and <endOfText>
<human>mhm<endOfText>
<bot>it's up now — did you know that?<endOfText>
<human>It's <endOfText>
<bot>Well I gather it is, yes.<endOfText>
<human>The awful thing is that the movies that I've been involved with in the last erm few years have entailed my being abroad a great deal, and I   was made in New York entirely and I was there for six or seven months, and the difficulty is that when you then make the movie and you take it round the world, you're away for another three or four months and so you end up being out of the country for quite a long time, so I've been nothing like as active with the university.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm rather ashamed.<endOfText>
<human>I'm a very absentee Pro-Chancellor I'm afraid.<endOfText>
<bot>That was Aisa, too, I might say, who persuaded me into that quite strange position  for an old ham actor to be in, but erm <endOfText>
<human>Well you may be an old ham actor, but I note you've picked up about five or six, I think, honourary degrees now.<endOfText>
<bot>erm have I?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, well, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>So somebody must think something of you.<endOfText>
<human>You very humbly describe yourself as an absent Pro-Chancellor, but you have taken a considerable interest in this university over the years, and we've been grateful for it.<endOfText>
<bot>How do you perceive the flavour of Sussex?<endOfText>
<human>It's unique, there's no question about that.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know any university that's quite like it.<endOfText>
<human>I think it's disciplines are extremely interesting.<endOfText>
<bot>I love them.<endOfText>
<human>The whole concept of the various courses here and schools here, I think they work marvellously and I think they're stimulating and I think, from my own point of view, admirable in this breadth of examination and erm investigation and enlightenment, which personally I think is desperately erm important in our current erm communities and that to  specialising too soon erm really can be almost counter-productive.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that Sussex in a way perhaps isn't quite as identifiable as it was and I think this doesn't necessarily cause by any particular circumstance or group of individuals or individual or whatever.<endOfText>
<human>I think to a large degree fashion has something to do with it — the innovatory concept of Sussex was very exciting in the Sixties, it's a bit old had not.<endOfText>
<bot>I think Sussex has got to find a new, new hat, and got to express itself and demonstrate that it is in no sense relying on twenty five years of erm of erm fairly high reputation that the next twenty five years and the next twenty five years after that are just as challenging, perhaps even more so.<endOfText>
<human>Again, I repeat with this problem of unemployment and so on, and the really obscene level of unemployment in this country at the moment — absolutely shocking I think — and I think the universities have to address themselves to that problem.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you for that.<endOfText>
<human>I'm all in favour.<endOfText>
<bot>All I can say is Amen in respect of what you were saying there.<endOfText>
<human>All right, let's go and talk about films now.<endOfText>
<bot>You've done your bit for the universities.<endOfText>
<human>Oh no, I'd much rather not .<endOfText>
<bot>Oh What a Lovely War is a very favourite film of mine still.<endOfText>
<human>I get very emotional when I see it.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think I can still yet watch it without weeping — it's such a powerful film of a powerful time, and a terrible time really.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>I was bitterly disappointed.<endOfText>
<human>I saw it erm  I ran it — I can't remember why I was running it, oh I think I wanted to look at an actor erm, oh no, it was at a festival and I had to sit through it and I was very disappointed in it, I found it slow and rather obvious and erm a little lacking in bite.<endOfText>
<bot>On the other hand its subject matter I found overwhelming.<endOfText>
<human>One or two sequences worked quite well, but I hope I'm a better director now than I was then.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh some marvellous performances in it, but really it was Joan Littlewood's intrinsic concept which was miraculous really, that's  and really I don't know whether the movie lost a lot as against the play — I think it lost something — the important thing was that millions of people who would never have seen it, had it remained purely as a theatre production, did see what Joan Littlewood had to say, saw her perceptions, her wit, her humanity, and therefore I think it was well worth making.<endOfText>
<human>And of course Ghandi was your big success, so far, in a sense.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean you got every award going in the universe, just about, for that one.<endOfText>
<human>How do you feel about that now looking back, are you beginning to get a little bit critical of yourself.<endOfText>
<bot>I hope so, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Ghandi came at the right time, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>There was a  we need another feeling now, it seems to me.<endOfText>
<human>I'm so sickened by the erm cynicism and scepticism and terrible jingoism that emanates to a large degree from the United States.<endOfText>
<bot>It seems to me that our leaders somehow or another have simply got to be persuaded that we are prepared to sacrifice a very great deal erm to secure erm a new attitude.<endOfText>
<human>That it is inconceivable that after this number of centuries man still believes that ultimately the only way in which problems are solved is by blowing the other chap's head off, which is so lunatic now.<endOfText>
<bot>We've only seen what we've seen just recently in Russia,<endOfText>
<human>mhm<endOfText>
<bot>but I'm digressing.<endOfText>
<human>Ghandi, I think, in the early eighties epitomised, to a large degree, and attitude of concern about erm violence, and I think that in some large measure the sort of recognition that it gained, particularly in the awards and so on, had a lot to do with its subject matter as against it's actual execution, and I think that if it had been at another time, or if the subject matter hadn't been erm quite as powerful as that old genius's life was, I don't think it would have won the awards.<endOfText>
<bot>I think it was a combination of  it was an okay movie, but it was also a wonderful subject, a wonderful subject.<endOfText>
<human>I was a very  good movie too, I must say.<endOfText>
<bot>Those two movies had messages, very clear messages coming through.<endOfText>
<human>Now how about A Chorus Line?<endOfText>
<bot>It was a challenge.<endOfText>
<human>I mean many people wrote disparagingly about your attempt, your nerve in taking on a gem of the New York stage and turning it into a British directed movie.<endOfText>
<bot>But erm did that have a message, or was that just a fun thing for you to do?<endOfText>
<human>Oh in large measure it was just a fun thing to do.<endOfText>
<bot>erm I mean I think if you dragged it in by its heels there is a message there, in that erm the struggle, again coming back to the university, that young people face in a competitive society, in an attempt to express themselves, to demonstrate that they have something to give and that no matter how difficult the whole economic circumstances are, and how problematical the question of employment is, young people are entitled, or society ought to see that they're entitled, erm to some manner of expression, some form of expression, to express themselves.<endOfText>
<human>If they don't have that opportunity erm then what are we all doing.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean what is the purpose of all this, bringing the cost of living down — I don't know, a thousand things that politicians pride themselves on doing — it seems to me that they all should be taking second place to the lives that up and coming generations are going to live.<endOfText>
<human>So I think that it's desperately important that people are conscious of that now.<endOfText>
<bot>In that little crucible of the theatre that story was demonstrated, that here were people of phenomenal talent, with an enormous amount to give, with the tremendous burning desire to express their feelings and their attitudes, and to the enhancement of other people's lives, and how cruel it was that it was so few that got through.<endOfText>
<human>So, if you drag it in, yes there is, but it really was a marvellous piece of entertainment, you know, it's a wonderful show and I absolutely adored it.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean I had the most profound admiration for the kids in New York.<endOfText>
<human>I mean they're unique <endOfText>
<bot>This came over very clearly from what you said.<endOfText>
<human>They're gypsies.<endOfText>
<bot>They call themselves gypsies.<endOfText>
<human>They sing and they dance and they act, and they do not believe unless they are profoundly proficient in all three that they're entitled to be considered gypsies.<endOfText>
<bot>I've never met a more dedicated, resilient group of people in my life.<endOfText>
<human>Many people, as they approach their prime of life, look for easy options.<endOfText>
<bot>You see to be going for bigger and better challenges.<endOfText>
<human>Lunatic really, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>My whole family background has been responsible, in a way, for, by virtue of the example of my parents, for my distress at witnessing prejudice, whether it be colour, or religious, or whatever, and intolerance, and so on, and I've wanted to do a subject about South Africa for a long time, and this was enhanced erm obviously when I made Ghandi because, as you know, the first twenty odd years of Ghandi's life <endOfText>
<human>Indeed.<endOfText>
<bot>adult life was spent in South Africa, and erm I found a couple of years ago two books written by a remarkable while English-speaking South African called Donald Woods, who was a newspaper editor, who befriended and then championed a remarkable young black South African called Steve Beeko, who was killed in police detention.<endOfText>
<human>And the movie is the story of their friendship and Donald Woods' conversion, in a way, to the erm cause that erm  called black consciousness which Steve Beeko erm promoted and so on, and it ends up with a sort of James Bond escape from South Africa in a way, in that Donald and his wife and his five children, harassed and threatened by the erm South African Government, finally escape.<endOfText>
<bot>It's an unequivocal condemnation of the obscenity of apartheid.<endOfText>
<human>The great problem we face is that obviously the authorities in South Africa don't want the picture to be made, and we're shooting it in Zimbabwe, where we've been made very welcome, and erm the difficulties is the creation of South Africa in Zimbabwe, which means you have to go all over the place.<endOfText>
<bot>It's a very costly business, you know, but it must ring true because of course the actuality's on our televisions screens every other night and if it doesn't have an authentic ring to it then people won't accept what the picture has to say.<endOfText>
<human>So, a man of many parts.<endOfText>
<bot>And film maker, and associated very much with this university I'm glad to say <endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>And long may it last.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you very much for talking to me Dickie.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh it's  a pleasure, Brian.<endOfText>
<human>Lovely to see you again.<endOfText>
<bot>Once again, good evening ladies and gentlemen, and once again I'd like to offer an especially warm welcome to this centenary lecture to those of you who've come from outside the university.<endOfText>
<human>If you were with us at the last occasion of this sort, the last centenary lecture on Gerter , given by Professor Corby, you will remember on that occasion erm he provided a focus of illumination in a period of power cuts, economic gloom and all the rest of it.<endOfText>
<bot>I am not very sure that things are very much better now, but at least the days are longer and we probably won't suffer a power cut tonight.<endOfText>
<human>But in many parts of the world, and some of them not very far away from here, upheavals and agonies are going on, not unlike some of those experienced within the lifetime of the subject of tonight's lecture.<endOfText>
<bot>This, incidentally, is the fifteenth in the series of great centenaries, held under the auspices of the Centre for Continuing Education, and it is to celebrate the death, and by that token the life and achievements, of the great English poet John Milton, who died in erm sixteen seventy four.<endOfText>
<human>I have very great pleasure in introducing our lecturer, my friend and colleague Professor Learner, who is professor of English in this university.<endOfText>
<bot>He was born in South Africa and he studied at the universities of Cape Town and Cambridge, and has taught in universities in Britain, in America, in West Africa and France and Germany.<endOfText>
<human>He joined this university shortly after it was founded, in fact in nineteen sixty two, and he became Professor of English in nineteen seventy.<endOfText>
<bot>As many of you know, Professor Learner is a frequent broadcaster, and contributor in prose and in verse to such journals as The New Statesman and The London Magazine.<endOfText>
<human>He's published three books of poetry, and two novels, and several works of literary criticism, the last of these, The Uses of Nostalgia, appeared in nineteen seventy two, and I understand, since this is a privileged occasion and puffs are in order, that his next book of poems, Arthur, will appear some time this year.<endOfText>
<bot>In addition to all this, Professor Learner has been involved at various times in university adult education, and he takes English Literature courses regularly for the Centre for Continuing Education students, usually, but not invariably, at Friends Centre in Brighton, and I am sure that like myself he is happy to see so many adults from outside the university with us tonight.<endOfText>
<human>Professor Learner on Milton.<endOfText>
<bot>The one thing that John Milton knew from the moment when he first began to reflect on his destiny, was that he was going to write a great poem.<endOfText>
<human>In one of his earliest pamphlets, called The Reason of Church Government, he said this about himself: ‘After I had for my first years, by the ceaseless diligence and care of my father, whom God recompense, been exercised to the tongues and some sciences as my age would suffer, by sundry masters and teachers, both at home and at the schools, it was found that whether ought was imposed me by them that had the overlooking, or be taken to of mine own choice in English or other tongue, prosing or versing but chiefly by this latter, style by certain vital signs it had was likely to live.<endOfText>
<bot>But much latelier, in the private academies of Italy, wither I was favoured to resort, perceiving that some trifles which I had in memory, composed at under twenty or thereabouts, for the manner is that everyone must give some proof of his wit a reading there, met with acceptance above what was looked for, and other things which I had shifted in scarcity of books and conveniences to patch up amongst them, were received with written incomience which the Italian is not forward to bestow on men of this side the Alps.<endOfText>
<human>I began thus for to assent both to them and diverse of my friends here at home and not less to an inward prompting which daily now grew upon me, that by labour and intent study, which I take to be my portion in this life, joined with a strong propensity of nature, I might perhaps leave something so written to aftertimes as they should not willingly let it die.’<endOfText>
<bot>That is obviously the summary of a long story of consistent dedication, overlaid with constant hesitation and changings of mind and alternations about what the actual plans were going to be about the work that would be left to aftertimes.<endOfText>
<human>We know more about Milton, his personal concerns and his literary plans than we do about any other poet of his time, and indeed it may be that we have to come right up to the nineteenth century before we learn so much about the inner life of any poet.<endOfText>
<bot>For instance, at the age of twenty one, Milton wrote a Latin poem, sixth of his Latin elegies and it's therefore just called Elegia Sexta.<endOfText>
<human>He wrote it to his friend, Charles Diodati and it's an answer, in Latin verse, to a letter from Diodati apologizing that his poems were not as good as usual because he was leading too much social life.<endOfText>
<bot>Milton replies with a twofold statement.<endOfText>
<human>He begins: ‘I, with my empty belly, send you good health, which you, whose belly is bulging, may perhaps need ’ and then the  falls into two halves.<endOfText>
<bot>The first half is in praise of feasting and drinking.<endOfText>
<human>Bacchus  song loves Bacchus and Bacchus loves songs, says Milton, and he gives us a whole stream of classical precedents, Ovid,Anacreon , Pinder, the whole lot to show that a poet naturally will love the good life.<endOfText>
<bot>It includes a good bit of flattery of Diodati and a celebration of the erotic lyric.<endOfText>
<human>Then he says ‘But he who tells of wars and heaven, under the sway of grown up Jupiter, of pious heroes and semi-divine leaders, who at one moment things of the holy assemblies of the gods on high and then of those deep kingdoms where a fierce dog barks, let him live in the frugal manner of Pythagoras and let herbs provide his harmless diet ’.<endOfText>
<bot>And then of course he gives classical precedence for this Tireseus, Orpheus, those poets who had magical powers, Homer, who  suggests not only frugal diet, but chastity will be the best preparation for the poet who has this task in hand.<endOfText>
<human>It's quite clear of course that though Diodati may belong to the first class, Milton belongs to the second.<endOfText>
<bot>He is the poet dedicated from the beginning to a high heroic task.<endOfText>
<human>Hence that opening line.<endOfText>
<bot>It is appropriate that he should be the one with the empty belly addressing his friend.<endOfText>
<human>And he finishes off this poem with a description of what he's now writing.<endOfText>
<bot>It is, in fact, the Nativity Hymn, Milton's first important poem, and he concludes ‘I am now singing’, or actually he says ‘We are now singing the peace bearing King sprung of celestial seed’.<endOfText>
<human>This is one of the earliest references we have in Milton to his own dedication to the task of preparing himself for leaving something to aftertimes that it would not willingly let die.<endOfText>
<bot>The plans change.<endOfText>
<human>You'll see his interest here in heroic material.<endOfText>
<bot>A little later we find him interested in the creation story and reading the now more or less unread epic on the divine week of creation by the French poet Du Bartas.<endOfText>
<human>Then a little later we find a great deal about romance.<endOfText>
<bot>He seems to be taking Spencer and Ariosto as his models.<endOfText>
<human>We also find him toying with the idea of writing an arthuriad , choosing his subject from English history.<endOfText>
<bot>Well being Milton, and being very thorough, he gives us long lists, of course, of dozens of possible subjects that he had in mind, but he seems to have taken the King Arthur story very seriously.<endOfText>
<human>In another Latin poem, for instance, called Mansus, written to a distinguished old man and patron of the arts, that he met in Italy, Giovanni Battista Manso, a friend of Tasso and Marini, Milton hopes that he too in his turn may find such a good friend and patron.<endOfText>
<bot>‘If ever I succeed’ he writes ‘in bringing our native kings back to life in my songs, and Arthur who waged wars even under the earth, or if I tell of the splendid heroes of the table rendered invincible by their bond of comradeship and, oh if inspiration would but come to me, if I smash the Saxon phalanxes beneath the impact of the British.’<endOfText>
<human>If ever he manages to do this, he concludes, he hopes he will have a patron of similar eminence.<endOfText>
<bot>None of the this got written.<endOfText>
<human>What happened instead was that Milton got caught up in politics and when the Civil War began he devoted his energy to pamphleteering.<endOfText>
<bot>Well in a way it's not surprising that none of this got done, if you reflect how common it is that poetic plans don't get fulfilled.<endOfText>
<human>But of course it did in a sense get done, but when Milton did write his great poem, as we'll see, it came out very differently.<endOfText>
<bot>Why have I begun with this story?<endOfText>
<human>Well, of course, because I want  in talking about Milton I want to stress his dedication.<endOfText>
<bot>Indeed, I suppose, I even want to raise in passing the thought how single-minded should a poet be.<endOfText>
<human>Do we think of the young poets with the young literary man?<endOfText>
<bot>This is not a purely historical question.<endOfText>
<human>Do we think of the young literary man as choosing, in a sense, to be a student of literature and to turn his energies to nothing — except perhaps earning his bread — to nothing except fitting himself for the poems we are going to write, or do we think of poetry as in a sense the bi-product of a life seriously dedicated to other matters?<endOfText>
<bot>And for this, I suppose timeless question, Milton does seem to me to offer a particularly interesting answer.<endOfText>
<human>Of course he belongs to the class which dedicates itself from the beginning, single-mindedly to literature, but yet not in the way we would think of.<endOfText>
<bot>First of all, for instance, the preparation which Milton felt it was necessary for him to give himself, was neither technical nor introspective.<endOfText>
<human>I mean by this it was not the sort of preparation which on the one hand Elizabethan erm critics and writers of rhetoric books, or on the other hand Ezra Pound in the twentieth century would advise to the poet that he must learn to turn a good sonnet or write in all the metrical forms, or accomplish himself deftly in the technical devices.<endOfText>
<bot>Nor was it in the romantic tradition that the cultivation of your own emotional development, the habits of seasoned and trade introspection, are really what the poet needs.<endOfText>
<human>The preparation in Milton's case was learn.<endOfText>
<bot>I am sure he would have considered that both technical accomplishment and, though not perhaps in the modern sense, introspection, were valuable for the poet, but the labour and intense study which you'll have noticed he referred to in that passage I've read, consisted of course of learning large numbers of languages, which he clearly did with great fluency, and reading inordinately the whole of human literature.<endOfText>
<human>Milton, I say it with confidence, even in the presence of my friend Peter Burke, was the most learned — was more learned than any man in this room.<endOfText>
<bot>Second, the special quality of erm Milton's preparation is that it was perfectly compatible with an act of life.<endOfText>
<human>Of course he complained when he entered political writing instead of preparing himself for his poem.<endOfText>
<bot>He felt, in fact, that he was giving up his career.<endOfText>
<human>His self defence, and I now read from actually only a paragraph or so earlier than my opening passage, his self defence in the reason of Church government is quite interesting erm ‘If I hunted after praise by the ostentation of wit and learning, I should not write thus out of mine own season, when I have neither yet completed to my mind the full circle of my private studies, although I complain not of any insufficiency to the matter in hand, or were I ready to my wishes it were a folly to commit anything elaborately composed to the careless and interrupted listening of these tumultuous times.<endOfText>
<bot>Next, if I were wise only to my own ends, I would certainly take such a subject as of itself might catch a clause, whereas this’— he is of course writing about the vexed question of erm Church government and the possible disappearance of episcopy —‘whereas this hath all the disadvantages on the contrary, and such a subject as the publishing whereof might be delayed at pleasure and time enough to pencil it over with the curious touches of art, even to the perfection of a faultless picture, whereas in this argument the not deferring it is of great moment to the good speeding.<endOfText>
<human>That, if solidity have leisure to do her office, art cannot have much.<endOfText>
<bot>Lastly, I should not choose this manner of writing, wherein knowing myself inferior to myself, led by the genial power of nature to another task, I have the use as I may account that of my left hand.’<endOfText>
<human>The reasons he feels uneasy at the task he's given himself, of pamphleteering, are first that he's not  he's had to interrupt his studies and is not get learned enough for his poem, though you will have noticed he considers himself quite learned enough for ecclesiastical politics.<endOfText>
<bot>Second, that he objects to the topicality of the subject that he's chosen, and finally that he's not, of course, at home writing prose.<endOfText>
<human>But I also began by raising the question of Milton's sense of dedication because I want to talk a little bit about the egoism of creation.<endOfText>
<bot>You might feel, you perhaps did feel, is it not astonishingly self-centred, is it not even offensively self-centred, this concern with his own greatness, his own importance, what I am writing now, what I shall achieve.<endOfText>
<human>His passages do, after all, occur, many of them, in political tracts, in which he stops and talks about himself.<endOfText>
<bot>Of course he's answering accusations when he stops and defends himself.<endOfText>
<human>Of course we can talk about the standard of controversy in the seventeenth century and habits of erm arguing ad hominem more than, I suppose, would normally be acceptable today.<endOfText>
<bot>All the same, what would you think of these reasons for inserting a piece of autobiography into the second defence of the English people, a defence of course for cutting off the head of Charles the First.<endOfText>
<human>But  in which he says that he's talking about himself ‘That so many good and learned men among the neighbouring nations who read my works may not be induced by this fellow's calumnies to alter the favourable opinion they have formed of me, followed by the assertion that the people of England whom fate, or duty, or their own virtues have incited me to defend may be convinced from the purity and integrity of my life that my defence, if it do not redown to their honour, can never be considered as their disgrace.’<endOfText>
<bot>Well I have to establish my own virtue and distinction.<endOfText>
<human>Why?<endOfText>
<bot>Because I am, after all, the defender of the English people.<endOfText>
<human>You could suspect that this is a way of making it more rather than less egoistic, couldn't you?<endOfText>
<bot>Indeed, there is — and we must confess it — there is no doubt about Milton's egoism as a man.<endOfText>
<human>I suppose the most striking illustration of this would be the story of the divorce tracts.<endOfText>
<bot>Milton gives us his own account of why he wrote his divorce tracts by saying ‘When the Bishops could no longer resist the multitude of their assailants, I had leisure to turn my thoughts to other subjects.<endOfText>
<human>When therefore I perceived that there were three species of liberty which are essential to the happiness of social life, religious, domestic and civil, and as I've already written concerning the first, and the magistrates were strenuously active in obtaining the third, I determined to turn my attention to the second, or the domestic species.<endOfText>
<bot>Nobody would guess from that admirably impersonal account that Milton settled to write his first divorce only a few weeks after the bitter disappointment of his marriage.<endOfText>
<human>Nor, I think, would you guess that in the divorce tracts there is an intensity of disillusion and indeed a self-pity.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I'll give you a specimen.<endOfText>
<human>It is not less than cruelty to force a man to remain in that state as the solace of his life, which he and his friends know will be either the undoing or the disheartening of his life.<endOfText>
<bot>We know from external evidence that Milton is clearly talking about himself at this point.<endOfText>
<human>It does not, however, prevent him from saying that now, in this tract — this is from the doctrine and discipline of divorce —‘The duty and right of an instructed Christian calls me, through the chance of good or even report, to be the sole advocate of a discountenanced truth.<endOfText>
<bot>A high enterprise, lords and commons, a high enterprise and a hard, and such as every seventh son of a seventh son does not venture on.’<endOfText>
<human>This can cast us back to that sense of aestheticism and dedication that we saw in the sixth elegy.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't suppose there's much doubt that Milton approached his marriage a little late in life with an intensity of idealism that must, to some degree, have derived from the high conception of the chastity to which he had up till then dedicated himself, and poor Mary Powell, just like Desdemona, becomes a victim of male idealisation and the unreasonable demands that it makes.<endOfText>
<human>Now I've not mentioned this not totally creditable episode in Milton's life, I've not mentioned it simply to make him unlikeable to you, but to go on and say that the kind of egoism which issues in this way in his life issues in a rather different way in his worth.<endOfText>
<bot>There it issues in a way which seems to me not only acceptable but poetically extremely valuable.<endOfText>
<human>‘Yet once more, oh ye laurels, and once more ye myrtles brown, with ivy never seer , I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude, and with forced fingers rude shatter your leaves before the mellowing year.<endOfText>
<bot>Bitter constraint and sad occasion dear compels me to disturb your season dew.<endOfText>
<human>For Lucidas is dead, dead 'ere his prime, young Lucidas and hath not left his peer.<endOfText>
<bot>Who would not sing for Lucidas.<endOfText>
<human>He knew himself to sing and build the lofty rhyme.<endOfText>
<bot>He must not float upon his watery bier unwept and welter to the parching wind without the mead of some melodious tear.’<endOfText>
<human>It is in a way saying the same thing as the preface to The Reason of Church Government.<endOfText>
<bot>‘Reluctant as I am, I must lay aside other tasks and do this one.’<endOfText>
<human>I presume that the  before the mellowing year, the premature moment at which he's dedicating himself is of course a personal reference concerning his own youth.<endOfText>
<bot>But the difference is that the degree to which Milton is speaking in his own person seems so much less in the poem, doesn't it?<endOfText>
<human>It's almost a kind of professional remark.<endOfText>
<bot>He's writing as the poet.<endOfText>
<human>If I do it for Edward King, somebody will do it for me.<endOfText>
<bot>Indeed, it's not only the writer who is depersonalised, but also the subject.<endOfText>
<human>It's not Edward King, the man who was actually drowned and whom, as it happens, Milton hardly knew, it's Lucidas, the figure of the young poet, priest, put to some extent on a classical model that he is writing about.<endOfText>
<bot>Lucidas, I suppose, more than any other poem of Milton's, and indeed I suppose more than any other poem in English, Lucidas shows us that there doesn't have to be a conflict between personal involvement and formal rhetoric.<endOfText>
<human>Though  the very fact that it is so traditional and so formal a poem in the pastoral tradition, held in the tightness of all the conventions that it employs, not only allows, but in some strange way makes possible, the intensity of personal feeling that it contains.<endOfText>
<bot>For instance, erm when he speaks the fact that the young man was cut off in his prime, perhaps the most famous passage of the lot ‘Alas what boots it with incessant care to tend the homely slighted shepherd's trade and strictly meditate the thankless muse.<endOfText>
<human>Were it not better done as other use to sport with Amaryllis in the shade, or with the tangles of Nayera's hair.’<endOfText>
<bot>Writing poetry is presented in the wholly artificial diction of tending the shepherd's trade, or in a Latinism that is not even correct, colloquial, normal English in meditating the thankless muse.<endOfText>
<human>The lures of sex, relaxation, all the things that distract you from your high heroic task, are in the form of nymphs with Latin names.<endOfText>
<bot>It's hard to imagine anybody writing more artificially, but I hope you feel, as I do, there can hardly be a piece of poetry in which the distress of the poet and the feeling that he may be wasting his time comes through in a more anguished fashion.<endOfText>
<human>And since I am raising this question of the universalizing and the depersonalizing of egoism as it becomes poetic dedication in poetry, I'd like to do this by offering you a contrast, and I choose as my contrast Alexander Pope, another poet who was obsessively concerned with his own role as a poet — in his satires in this case.<endOfText>
<bot>He spent a good deal of time in his satires, presenting himself as a satirist — unplaced, unpensioned, no man's heir or slave he proudly describes himself as he tells us that he's willing to lash out at even the most eminent public figures.<endOfText>
<human>It's impressive, in a way, as an assertion of poetic independence.<endOfText>
<bot>But it's almost impossible to separate it from thinking of Alexander Pope the man.<endOfText>
<human>‘I will or perish in the generous cause.<endOfText>
<bot>Hear this and tremble, you who scape the laws.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, while I live, no rich or noble maid shall walk the world in credit to his grave.’<endOfText>
<bot>I'm not very sure it's prudent if you're indicating your own incorruptibility as a poet to put it in the future tense in the first place, and when you continue as Pope does ‘Envy must own, I live among the great’ as he starts to describe his own life and you realise he's bringing in touches about himself which really have very little to do with the particular role as poet, it becomes quite clear that that depersonalisation process has not taken place in the case of Pope.<endOfText>
<human>erm I suppose the very extreme of such self-satisfaction is in the epilogue to Pope's satires, where he actually tells us ‘Yes, I am proud.<endOfText>
<bot>I must be proud to see men not afraid of God afraid of me.’<endOfText>
<human>Hence rhyme, you can see, is a two-edged weapon in the hands of a poet.<endOfText>
<bot>Now, as I say, poetic boasting is, in a way, something that is common to both Pope and Milton.<endOfText>
<human>I think once more, but now for the last time, I'm going to turn back again to the preface to The Reason of Church Government and  whoops  and read you one more sentence erm in which he is apologizing once more for having entered the fray, the political fray ‘But although a poet, soaring in the high region of his fancies, with his garland and singing robes about him, might without apology speak more of himself than I mean to do, yet for me, sitting here below in the cool element of prose, a mortal thing among many readers of no imperial conceit, to venture and divulge unusual things of myself, I shall petition to the gentler sort it may not be envy to me.’<endOfText>
<bot>And he then actually goes on and writes the passage I began by reading of straight autobiography.<endOfText>
<human>Well you'll see that in that apology Milton appears to be conscious of the very point that I am trying to make, that is to say it might be considered out of place in this prose work to speak of myself in direct factual terms, although a poet — a poet intending to write of things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme — a poet soaring in the high region of his fancies, with his garland and singing robes about him, in other words where we can't or aren't really invited to make out his individual identity very clearly because it is his role as poet that concerns us, there he clearly feels it would be proper.<endOfText>
<bot>When he came to write Paradise Lost, Milton on four occasions deliberately spoke in his own person in a way very close to the opening of Lucidas, or to the programme which that last sentence suggests to us.<endOfText>
<human>These are the four exordia or openings to books one, three, seven and nine.<endOfText>
<bot>The most is the invocation to light in book three, in which Milton speaks out of his blindness, uses that to place himself in a tradition, and again without foregoing his intensity of personal involvement.<endOfText>
<human>Indeed, I think that probably is the rival to Lucidas as the demonstration of how the depersonalizing is compatible with the most intense personal involvement.<endOfText>
<bot>But I'm going to read you something much shorter from one of the  from I suppose the least well known of the exordia, that is the one to book seven.<endOfText>
<human>erm the ostensible subject of this passage is that he's now finished with hell and heaven as the setting for his poems, and he's coming down to earth for what is left.<endOfText>
<bot>‘Standing on earth, not wrapped above the pole, more safe I sing, withe moral voice unchanged to horse or mute, though fallen on evil days, on evil days though fallen and evil towns, in darkness and with dangers compassed round and solitude.<endOfText>
<human>Yet not alone while though visits my slumbers nightly, or when morn purples the east.<endOfText>
<bot>Still govern though my song Urania and fit audience find, though few.<endOfText>
<human>But drive far off the barbarous dissonance of Bacchus and his revellers.<endOfText>
<bot>The race of the wild route that torn the Thresian bard in rodderpee , where wood and rocks had ears to rapture to the savage clamour drowned both harp and voice.<endOfText>
<human>Nor could the muse defend her son.<endOfText>
<bot>So fail not though who thee implores, for thou are heavenly, she an empty dream.’<endOfText>
<human>Once again I think we have a great intensity of personal feeling.<endOfText>
<bot>He speaks directly to us in the first person and he expresses something very like fear and even self-pity, the distress of the poet, seeing himself as a kind of natural victim, and it may be the distress of the puritan living on after the Restoration and afraid of the wild route, which is Charles the Second's court, though I think we can be a little sceptical of this and we certainly don't know with sufficiently accuracy when Paradise Lost was written.<endOfText>
<human>It is the context of the poet, inspired but misunderstood, humble in front of the muse.<endOfText>
<bot>It is intensely personal, but again one can detect in it mechanisms used to control the feeling and turn it from a mere discharge of personal feeling into a genuine expression of emotion.<endOfText>
<human>Primarily, I suppose, the rhythm, the very moving strange erm playing of sentences against blank verse, unchanged to horse or mute, though fallen on evil days, on evil days though fallen and evil tongues.<endOfText>
<bot>And also, of course, the reference to Orpheus, a figure who clearly haunted Milton's imagination as that of the poet of enormous power but somehow also the natural victim.<endOfText>
<human>erm this passage, of course, about the savage clamour drowning both harp and voice, refers to the legend of Orpheus being torn to pieces by the Thrashian women, which Milton also uses in Lucidas.<endOfText>
<bot>So, my perhaps trite point in conclusion is that there is no tension, or rather there is a tension, but there is no incompatibility or contradiction between formality and personal involvement in the case of Milton.<endOfText>
<human>And now, clearly, it's time I turned to the poem itself, having spent most of my hour on the question of how Milton got there.<endOfText>
<bot>When he finally found his subject, it was, as you all know, the Fall of Man, the eating of the apple, taken from Genesis.<endOfText>
<human>And it was the right subject — he got there in the end — because it enabled him to use everything that was most important in his own experience.<endOfText>
<bot>For instance, it enabled him to use the very struggle for a subject, which had occupied so much of his line, since we can partly see that struggle as a struggle within Milton over his own humanist heritage.<endOfText>
<human>That is the struggle between Milton the poet and Milton the puritan.<endOfText>
<bot>This is a constant dilemma.<endOfText>
<human>Suppose somebody read to you, without telling you the author, but telling you the date — the early seventeenth century  lines like this ‘But let my due feet never fail to walk the studious cloisters pale and love the high embowered rough with antique pillars and  and storeyed windows richly dyked, casting a dim religious light, there let the pealing organ blow to the full-voiced choir below in service high and anthems clear, as may with sweetness through mine ear dissolve me into ecstasies and bring all heaven before my eyes.<endOfText>
<bot>And may at last my weary age find out the peaceful hermitage, the hairy gown and mossy sill where I may sit and rightly spell of every star that heaven doth show, and every herb that sips the dew, till old experience do attain to something like prophetic strain.’<endOfText>
<human>Well, you would say attractive poet, fertile imagination, lover of the sense, likes organ music, likes stained glass windows, is sympathetic to the idea of monasticism retiring into a hermitage, probably a Roman Catholic.<endOfText>
<bot>And you were then told that he was the great propagandist of those who went around a dozen years or so later breaking down these storeyed windows, richly dykes, because it was of course profane and idolatrous to have that dim religious light in your churches.<endOfText>
<human>You could hardly deny that there's a certain tension between poet and puritan.<endOfText>
<bot>Indeed, if we want a puritan poet at that time, we would do far better to turn to that good, upright Anglican priest George Herbert, than we would to John Milton.<endOfText>
<human>George Herbert addresses his own conscience, ‘Peace prattler, do not lower, not a fair look, but though dost call it foul; not a sweet dish, but though dost call it sour.<endOfText>
<bot>Music to thee doth howl.<endOfText>
<human>By listening to thy chatting fears I have both lost mine eyes and ears.’<endOfText>
<bot>And we discover the doctrine that conscience reprimands you for every one of your pleasures erm sweet dishes, music, everything, because they are all the product of depraved and sinful human nature.<endOfText>
<human>The doctrine of the fall, the all pervading fall, of man through all man's faculties, the good Calvinist doctrine is held clearly with much more intensity here.<endOfText>
<bot>Now when it came to Paradise Lost, this tension, which is simply excluded from Il Penseroso, is actually inserted into the poem.<endOfText>
<human>It's inserted into the poem in two ways: first the devils are identified with the pagan gods — they are introduced, indeed, with a great fanfare in the first book and given all sorts of classical erm and oriental names, and Milton explains to us that of course it was the devils themselves who managed to disperse this tradition that that's who they really were; and second, and though less central and less impressive in its poetic results, is perhaps the second device which is more interesting when we think of the poem in terms of Milton's personal involvement.<endOfText>
<bot>Second he tells us that the classical paradises, which you can read about it in ancient authors, none of them are as fine as the Garden of Eden.<endOfText>
<human>‘Not that fair field of Enna where Prosepene , gathering flowers, herself a fairer flower by gloomy diss was gathered, which costs series all that pain to seek her through the world.<endOfText>
<bot>Nor that sweet grove of Daphne Biorontes and the inspired Castilian spring might with this paradise of eden strive.<endOfText>
<human>William Emser has resurrected for us a brilliantly stupid comment by the eighteenth century classical scholar Bentley on these lines.<endOfText>
<bot>Bentley says of them ‘With a silly thought in the middle and a sillily conducted in its several points.<endOfText>
<human>Not Enna says he, not Daphne, nor Fonds Castalus , nor Beaser , nor Mount Amera could compare with Paradise.<endOfText>
<bot>Why, who would suspect they could, though you had never told us.’<endOfText>
<human>And says Emser ‘A man who had given all his life to the classics might easily have suspected it’.<endOfText>
<bot>Here we have, of course, the explanation why these lines are so enormously moving.<endOfText>
<human>Milton is paying to Eden the highest compliment in his power.<endOfText>
<bot>He is throwing away for it a lifetime's dedication to classical studies.<endOfText>
<human>It is my little pet theory about religious poetry that the greatest religious poetry is an act of renunciation and therefore what you have to do is put in what you're giving away.<endOfText>
<bot>You write the same poem over and over again and tell us what you're no longer going to do.<endOfText>
<human>‘Nothing in this marvellous list’ says Milton ‘was as fine as Eden’and of course it hurts him to say it, and I don't think it's far fetched to detect that hurt and pain of that great sacrifice that John Milton is making in the rhythm when we read ‘Might with this paradise of Eden strive’, or in the fact that he can't stop there, because I didn't — as you will have realized from Bentley's comment — I didn't read you the whole passage.<endOfText>
<bot>He goes on ‘Nor that niceanile girt with the River Triton, where Old Cham , whom gentiles Annan call and Libian Jove , his  and his florid son, young Bacchus’, sorry ‘hid’— gracious me, there's a misprint.<endOfText>
<human>Milton  ‘Where Old Old Cham , whom gentiles Annan call and Libian Jove , hid  and her florid son, young Bacchus from his stepday Maria's eye, nor where abasin kings there issue guard Mount Amara, though this by some suppose true paradise under the Ethiope line by  head enclosed with shining rock a whole day's journey high, but wide remote from this Asyrian garden where the fiend saw undelighted or delight.’<endOfText>
<bot>You can see Milton can't stop.<endOfText>
<human>He's got to go on for another ten lines, piling on more and more out of the way references to classical paradises so that he can give it all away for God.<endOfText>
<bot>So far from being, as you might at first glance suspect, a wanton display of Milton's monstrous learning, it's a piece of triumphant relevance.<endOfText>
<human>The more he can find to dazzle us with the greater is the compliment that he pays to Eden.<endOfText>
<bot>Indeed, this very struggle that I find so fascinating in the writing of Paradise Lost, you know,a rather intimate way I feel I can see it in eleven words that come just a little earlier in the fourth book, in which he tells us ‘Seeing the apples growing on the trees, that they are hisperian fables true, if true here only and of delicious taste’.<endOfText>
<human>I like to think that Milton originally wrote hispearian fables true and of delicious taste.<endOfText>
<bot>It's metrically quite plausible.<endOfText>
<human>That would be a gesture of supreme eloquence by Milton, the humanist.<endOfText>
<bot>That would be an extravagance of classicallly based compliment and then Milton the puritan comes along and says to himself that won't do, we need a footnote, and in goes the footnote if true here only — don't forget that these classical legends are all lies.<endOfText>
<human>Paradise Lost, like Colmris is a poem with a thesis, but the counter position of the thesis is so powerful that the poem, both these poems, have to be described as the enactment of a conflict, rather than the giving us of the result.<endOfText>
<bot>The thesis, of course, is quite simple.<endOfText>
<human>The poem sets out to justify the ways of God to men, and what little time is left me will be devoted to justifying the ways of god to men, and we must begin this, sorry  we must begin this by a word on on the fall — the way of God  the ways of God to men of course are punishing men for the fall.<endOfText>
<bot>If the circumstances of this crime — that is the eating of the apple — are duly considered, it will be acknowledged to have been a most heinous offence and a transgression of the whole law.<endOfText>
<human>For what sin can be named which was not included in this one act.<endOfText>
<bot>It comprehended at once distrust in the divine voracity and a proportionate credulity in the assurances of satan, unbelief, Side B graditude , disobedience, gluttony, ‘In the man excessive uxoriousness, in the woman a want of proper regard for her husband, in both an insensibility to the welfare of their offspring and that offspring the whole human race.<endOfText>
<human>Parasite, theft, invasion of the rights of others, sacrilege, deceit, presumption in aspiring to divine attributes, fraud in the means employed to attain the object, pride and arrogance.<endOfText>
<bot>That comes from Milton's Latin Treaties on Christian Doctrine, and you can see he certainly must have felt he'd found his subject.<endOfText>
<human>It clearly implies a world order in which the prime virtue is obedience, not a world order that's exactly to our twentieth century democratic taste, but then after all not a world order altogether to Milton's taste, as we can remind ourselves by thinking of his plea for unlicensed printing the Areopagitica.<endOfText>
<bot>Obedience is, of course, to God and not to man.<endOfText>
<human>Well, I am alas going to have to leave out my discussion of God in Paradise Lost, the question of whether, by presenting the obedience to God you can somehow make it more palatable to the readers' tastes than you could if it was entirely thought of as a secular morality.<endOfText>
<bot>And the answer of course is that it depends how much you make God like yourself, and that's a test that Milton doesn't come altogether well out of.<endOfText>
<human>But I want really, in conclusion, to jump straight to the central part of the poem in which the ways of God to man,got to me are most clearly  justification's most clearly involved, and that is the actual process of the fall.<endOfText>
<bot>Milton's task, of course, is to convince us of the sin involved.<endOfText>
<human>Just to convince us that all these things that he tells us about are somehow present, to convince us of the heinousness of what he's done.<endOfText>
<bot>In a word, I suppose I think he succeeds better with Eve than he does with Adam.<endOfText>
<human>But I'm going to put the evidence in front of you and ask you to decide for yourselves.<endOfText>
<bot>Immediately after the climax of the poem — the tremendous lines in which no so saying ‘A rash hand in evil hour forth reaching to the fruit she plucked, she ate’.<endOfText>
<human>Immediately after this big moment the earth is convulsed with horror we have Eve's first speech, presumably after the fall  the first speech in a state of sin, and this is it ‘Oh sovereign virtuous, precious of all trees in Paradise, of operation blest to sapinense hitherto obscured in famed and thy fair fruit let hang as to not end created, but henceforth my early care not without song each morning and dew/due pray shall tend thee and the fertile burden ease of thy full branches offered free to all.<endOfText>
<bot>Till dieted by thee I grow mature in knowledge, as the Gods who all things know.<endOfText>
<human>Though others envy what they cannot give, for had the gift been theirs it had not here thus grown.<endOfText>
<bot>Experience next to thee I owe, best guide, not following thee I have remained ignorance.<endOfText>
<human>Thou openest wisdom's way and gives  no secret she retire.<endOfText>
<bot>And I perhaps am secret.<endOfText>
<human>Heaven is high, high and remote to see from thence distinct each thing on earth.<endOfText>
<bot>Another care perhaps may have diverted from continual watch our great forbidder safe with all his spies about him.<endOfText>
<human>But to Adam, in what sort shall I appear?<endOfText>
<bot>Shall I to him make know as yet my change and give him to partake full happiness with me?<endOfText>
<human>Or rather not, but keep the odds of knowledge in my power without co-partner, so to add what wants in female sex the more to draw his love and render me more equal and perhaps a thing not undesirable sometimes superior, for inferior .<endOfText>
<bot>This may be well, but what if God has seen and death ensue, then I shall be no more and Adam wedded to another Eve shall live with her enjoying I extinct a death to think.<endOfText>
<human>Confirm then I resolve, Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe , so dear I love him that with him all deaths I could endure without him live no life.’<endOfText>
<bot>Well that shows us what a dramatist was lost to the English stage when Milton finally decided to write it as an epic and not as a play.<endOfText>
<human>Eve starts with an extravagance.<endOfText>
<bot>Well we might consider frenzied and suspect —‘Oh sovereign virtuous, precious of all trees’, though we must be careful of course because in the formal style of Paradise Lost such opening addresses are common.<endOfText>
<human>Well we can have no doubt when a moment later she turns to idolatry and assures the tree that her early care ‘Not without song each morning and due/dew praise’— a little excessive for a tree, perhaps.<endOfText>
<bot>That's what she's going to devote to it.<endOfText>
<human>And, indeed, as befits someone who's hovering on the edge of idolatry, even her vocabulary has gone a little pagan ‘Till dieted by thee I grow mature in knowledge as the Gods who all things know’, and then what I think is a brilliant touch on Milton's part, the very next line says to us ‘Though others envy what they cannot give’.<endOfText>
<bot>Now the others she's referring to there must be God, but she cannot immediately go on and so bluntly say, in the very next line anyway, you know, it was only the serpent who showed it to me, God is going to be envious of me.<endOfText>
<human>So it's this kind of vague offstage ‘others’ who seem to have the power in that case.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, you'll also have noticed I am sure that as she went on touches of uneasiness began to appear.<endOfText>
<human>For instance, after she had said I would have remained in ignorance, the tree opens wisdoms way though secret she retire, the word secret catches up almost by a mechanical verbal train of association the thought and on it perhaps  secret and then all these uneasy feelings that perhaps God's so far away, or he wasn't watching, or in some way or other he didn't actually see.<endOfText>
<bot>erm then when it comes to Adam, the first thought in relation to Adam is of course that she's improved her own position, isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>It's only after that that once again she begins to be worried at possible consequences ‘What if God hath seen and death ensue, then I shall be no more and Adam wedded to another Eve’ and therefore, of course, ‘Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe’.<endOfText>
<bot>C S Lewis, a little unkindly, describes this as murder <endOfText>
<human>in which he says that erm the more convinced that she is that it's going to be fatal in its operation, the more determined apparently she is that Adam shall share.<endOfText>
<bot>Whether she is consciously twisting logic, or just, poor girl, confused, I'm not sure, but at the end it's quite clear ‘So dear I love them that with him all deaths I could endure, without him live no life’, that she's got into a world of fantasy because the one thing that is of course not in question is that Adam should die and that she should live on, which appears to be what she's referring to here.<endOfText>
<human>Now I think this is a brilliant speech, but I have to admit that it is a speech which, in showing the egoism, the confusion and the self-deception of Eve, assumes a valid order which is being destroyed.<endOfText>
<bot>That is to say, it assumes the hierarchical erm conception of God's world and the ethic of obedience, which, as we saw from that prose passage, underlies the conception of the fall as the central sin.<endOfText>
<human>And this point is even more clear-cut with Adam.<endOfText>
<bot>The last passage I'm going to have time to read comes in the erm speech of Adam erm, not actually speech, the inward soliloquy to Adam, the first thing that he says  he says his case is not yet fallen when he sees Eve.<endOfText>
<human>Eve comes to him and tells him what she's done.<endOfText>
<bot>‘Oh fairest of creation, last and best of all God's works, creature in whom excelled whatever can to sight or thought be formed, wholly divine, good, amiable or sweet, how art thou lost?<endOfText>
<human>How on a sudden lost, defaced, deflowered and now to death devote, rather how has thou yielded to transgress the strict forbiddance, how to violate the sacred fruit forbidden.<endOfText>
<bot>Some cursed fraud of enemy hath beguiled thee yet unknown, and me with thee hath ruined, for with thee certain my resolution is to die.<endOfText>
<human>How can I live without thee?<endOfText>
<bot>How forego thy sweet converse and love so dearly joined, to live again in these wild woods forlorn.<endOfText>
<human>Should God create another Eve and I another rib of , yet loss of thee would never from my heart.<endOfText>
<bot>No, no, I feel the link of nature draw me.<endOfText>
<human>Flesh of flesh, bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.’<endOfText>
<bot>In a way, the most important word in the whole of that speech is probably ‘nature’—‘I feel the link of nature draw me’ because here now Adam is using the word nature as, I suppose, he would not have used it at any earlier point in the poem.<endOfText>
<human>It is being used as something contrasted to God's order.<endOfText>
<bot>He's already feeling that there is a counter movement in him which he is prepared to call nature, which links him to Eve and which will lead him to join Eve in her defiance of God.<endOfText>
<human>We have of course got here a speech about a human bond versus a larger loyalty.<endOfText>
<bot>About a link of nature versus accepting your place in God's universe and obeying God's instructions.<endOfText>
<human>Milton, we could say, is here showing us the price of following God's command.<endOfText>
<bot>What, once sin has entered the world, it can cost you to obey all those injunctions in the new testament about ‘I am thy father and thy mother,sell all and follow me.’<endOfText>
<human>And of course he's showing us Adam's failure to follow .<endOfText>
<bot>You could even say that Milton's rejecting the future in this speech and saying I label sin what is going to become, if you have prophetic powers, new kind of ethic.<endOfText>
<human>And to justify the ways of God to men with such honesty, that is to say with such a complete account of what the price is which would have to be paid, is of course no longer to justify but to enact the actual conflict.<endOfText>
<bot>It is no longer to come down on one side or other of the fence as the entire poem was so clearly designed to do, but to say following the ways of God will mean this.<endOfText>
<human>And that, of course, is why in the end, though we can all read Paradise Lost alike, and we can all in a certain sense respond to Paradise Lost alike, we must come to our final conclusions about the poem in terms of our own values.<endOfText>
<bot>And for the humanist reader, for this reason Paradise Lost is really the greatest reputation of Christianity that's ever been written.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>This is the second in our new series of twelve programmes on opportunities in education, in which we're looking at some of the ideas in action in schools today.<endOfText>
<human>Contributors are largely from the Education Faculty at the university, and today I have with me Dr Johanna Turner, who is a Developmental Psychologist and the person who is particularly interested in development in young children.<endOfText>
<bot>Jo, at what stage do you think that formal education ought to start for a child?<endOfText>
<human>As you know, at the moment it starts and five, but ideally perhaps it could start younger, but obviously there are financial considerations as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Perhaps a development of nursery education on a much greater scale, bigger scale than has hitherto been the case <endOfText>
<human>Well, be careful what you're committing me to say.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean you asked me about formal education and immediately we're talking about nursery education.<endOfText>
<human>Now I don't want necessarily to equate the two of them.<endOfText>
<bot>I do think some formal education could start sooner, but I wouldn't want you or the listeners to think that nursery education and formal education are one and the same.<endOfText>
<human>What is the difference, basically?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I think one of the advantages of a nursery schooling is certainly a considerable amount of social interaction for the children, which very often they won't be obtaining, either if they're living in high rise flats, or at the other end of the social spectrum if their parents are living in large houses with large gardens and no other children within the vicinity.<endOfText>
<human>So I think it has a social function, as well as a formal educational function.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you think that the social function comes before the formal function, or do you think they both go together?<endOfText>
<human>I think it would depend on the child.<endOfText>
<bot>For some children they are more socially deprived, and yet they may be getting considerable ‘education’ in inverted commas within their home environment.<endOfText>
<human>For other children they probably are getting enough social interaction, there may be plenty of children around, but educationally, in terms of the sort of basics for education they may be extremely deprived.<endOfText>
<bot>I think there are many functions that it serves.<endOfText>
<human>Do children develop at roughly the same rate?<endOfText>
<bot>Can you say that all three year olds are roughly the same?<endOfText>
<human>You can say that three year olds are more like other three year olds than, say, thirty year olds would be like other thirty year olds, and the younger the child the more true that is, so that would be much more true at age a year, assuming that there aren't any physical defects or mental defects, than say at three.<endOfText>
<bot>So by three, yes, there is some variation, but they are certainly  there is less variation than you would get at the end of the secondary school or university.<endOfText>
<human>And are there quite specific stages that one can recognise perhaps as a developmental psychologist which take place at roughly particular times in a child's development?<endOfText>
<bot>Very broadly.<endOfText>
<human>Could you give me some idea of what these might be in the very early years perhaps?<endOfText>
<bot>Perhaps I could, but whether I should is a different point.<endOfText>
<human>I feel that once parents begin to become too aware of norms, they worry, and therefore unless a child is grossly out of sync, if you like, with their peers, I wouldn't say it would matter, but yes, one would expect a three year old to be talking at one extreme.<endOfText>
<bot>If there is no speech by three, indeed if there is no speech earlier than that, it might be very important to check that the child is not deaf.<endOfText>
<human>I think also you would expect children who are really quite young, well before the first year, to be showing social interest in other adults around, and if they're not it might be worth checking that there isn't some problem with the child.<endOfText>
<bot>But generally speaking I'm not very happy about norms.<endOfText>
<human>Oh well we won't press you on that  particular point then.<endOfText>
<bot>There's been a lot of publicity recently about parents teaching their own children, rather formal things.<endOfText>
<human>There have been one or two stories about youngsters who've become  reached a very high level in mathematics, for example.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you in favour of parents teaching their own children?<endOfText>
<human>Well can I come to that in a minute, because you said something I'd like to pick up.<endOfText>
<bot>You said the child may not be developing in the way the parent expects the child to develop, and I think that it's very important for parents to check out their expectations.<endOfText>
<human>If they are expecting something that they haven't got, it may well be that their expectation is wrong.<endOfText>
<bot>What is important is the child that they have in front of them, and to learn to understand that child.<endOfText>
<human>It's not it's brother or sister, or their brother or sister, it is unique, and it's pattern of development, although of course it will be broadly similar to other children, exactly like no other child, and in a sense I would feel that the parental job is to judge very carefully the needs and the developmental cycle of their own child, and then stimulate to the extent that that child needs.<endOfText>
<bot>Now having said that, of course, I've almost answered the other question, that I just do not believe there are any rules.<endOfText>
<human>I mean maybe you're thinking of the sort of publicized cases of a nine year old, I believe it was, who's got A levels in mathematics.<endOfText>
<bot>I would not want to say that I could criticise that parent, because I don't know the background of it.<endOfText>
<human>I would very much hope that other parents would not feel that they ought to be doing to the same thing, unless their circumstances were very similar.<endOfText>
<bot>If you have a child who appears to show a talent at one thing, then of course it's natural to let the child do what it enjoys doing, but that might be the very moment for saying well what is this child not talented at and ensuring that this child gets some experience of the kind of world that it not part of its own talents, so I would feel, from my own point of view and as a psychologist, that if you have a child who is very talented in mathematics, then fine, it's going to be quite good at mathematics one would assume, now's the time to say well is it as equally talented in music?<endOfText>
<human>Are there other things that could develop?<endOfText>
<bot>Has it got erm a wide social relationship with other children?<endOfText>
<human>So that at the end of the day one has a much more rounded individual with of course specific talents.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm not for holding back children.<endOfText>
<human>I think parental anxieties are something with which one must have great sympathy because very often the anxiety is not so much an anxiety about the child, it's an anxiety about the parent.<endOfText>
<bot>If they have had difficulty in school they will worry that their child is having difficulty in school.<endOfText>
<human>Now of course it may be that the child has caught a worry about schooling from the parent, but I think that's the first thing to sort out — is this really a problem in the child, or is it a problem in the parent's mind?<endOfText>
<bot>And secondly, I mean obviously parents are more worried if they feel that their child is not doing as well as somebody else's child, and we're back to this question of expectation again — where did they get the expectation that this other child is, as it were, some sort of norm that they ought to be living up to , and parents should talk to teachers and to other people who know their child and have got experience of their child as against other children to find out really whether their worries are truly grounded, or whether they are just groundless.<endOfText>
<human>I think to come back to an earlier question of what should you teach them, and what is normal, is that ideally a child wants to grow up in an environment where his or her parents enjoy here, where the relationship is enjoyable on both sides and not shot through with anxiety about how well this child is developing, providing the development is within the normal range.<endOfText>
<bot>If the child has a special skill or the parent has a special interest and they enjoy together exchanging this skill or interest, like teaching a child to swim very young, teaching it to play or listen to music, or play very simple rhythmic sounds, then as long as it is done within a relationship that is, above all, a loving relationship, great.<endOfText>
<human>But if it's done as a way of accelerating the child's development, in order, as it were, to give it the edge over its peers, that doesn't seem to me to suggest a relationship in which parent and child are enjoying each other ; it is much more a relationship in which the child is being prepared for competition with its peers and this, I feel, probably is going to turn out badly, because almost inevitably the child will not reach the levels that the parent has build up in fantasy in its own mind.<endOfText>
<bot>How do you feel about parents teaching children how to read?<endOfText>
<human>I think it comes to the same thing.<endOfText>
<bot>If the parent feels they know a system that they have heard or read is successful, and if they try it out on the child and the child obviously enjoys it, if it becomes part of a game, then I can't see any harm in it, but I think the parent has to be scrupulously honest as to whether the child is enjoying it.<endOfText>
<human>If there's any hint that the child isn't enjoying it then I don't think it should happen.<endOfText>
<bot>If parents really want to help their children, with reading specifically, I feel that Margaret Donaldson, who is and educational psychologist in Edinburgh, is correct when she points out that one of the greatest difficulties children have when they go to school is that many of them don't understand what kind of activity reading is.<endOfText>
<human>For instance, they don't understand, as she quotes in her book, what somebody is doing when they're reading a newspaper, or what it means when the postman looks at a envelope.<endOfText>
<bot>Now if parents, through playing games with their children that are based on words, could alert the child to the fact that print is a convention and that we can translate print into reality, obviously not as abstract as that, but just get the child used to knowing what print is, knowing what reading is, so that perhaps when they go to school they may well know this is a skill that they don't have, like they don't know, perhaps, how to ride a bike, they may not know how to swim, they certainly don't know how to drive a car, but they do know what sort of a thing driving a car is.<endOfText>
<human>In that way, I think they'd be much more prepared for learning the skill than if they go completely unprepared and see children looking at books and saying things and it makes no sense to them.<endOfText>
<bot>My last question is  is really again about making children do things, as opposed to encouraging or helping them to do things.<endOfText>
<human>You say that so far as you're concerned, it's all right for children to learn if in fact they're enjoying it and if in fact they want to and they're not being coerced.<endOfText>
<bot>Surely that makes the transition between home and school a rather traumatic one?<endOfText>
<human>Having worked and been around the Brighton first schools for many years, I would very much hope that the transition is not traumatic.<endOfText>
<bot>Certainly, the  most of the infant teachers I know take great pains to make sure that it is not traumatic and that the move from home to school is as easy as possible.<endOfText>
<human>Now having said that, often the trauma, which goes back to my original remark, is the sheer number of children, the sort of social impact that a reception class can have.<endOfText>
<bot>Now if a parent can have introduced the child via nursery school to that amount of other children, then I think there should be very little trauma, but that isn't to say that as the child gets older they don't have to do things.<endOfText>
<human>But if a child has to do something because they can understand the end a which they're aiming, in the way that a footballer has to train, or a boxer has to train, then it becomes easier to do the equivalent of training.<endOfText>
<bot>One of the difficulties is that the end state is so far removed from the average child that it is very difficult for them to see why they have to learn to read, but if they can realize that if they learn to read in those houses where they have it they'll be able to read the Radio Times and know what the television programmes are, that at least is motivating.<endOfText>
<human>I mean reading as to be put in a context and a context that is, in fact, enjoyable to the child, not something that just happens at school that they have to do, hence one they go to school the value of parents hearing the children read, because then the parent is also involved and one doesn't get this split between home and school.<endOfText>
<bot>Well thank you very much, Jo.<endOfText>
<human>Hello.<endOfText>
<bot>This is another programme in which we explore the boundaries of science, limits to what we know, or can possibly discover.<endOfText>
<human>Today we look at the start of it all, the creation of the universe.<endOfText>
<bot>John Barrow is an astronomer at the university.<endOfText>
<human>John, how long ago was the universe created?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I think all we can say with any confidence is that the patterns of evolution and behaviour going on within it today indicate that it has an apparent beginning between about fifteen and eighteen billion years ago.<endOfText>
<human>You say an apparent beginning, does that mean there's a great deal of uncertainty associated with it?<endOfText>
<bot>There is an uncertainty in the sense that we today observe the universe to be in a state of expansion, that is the most distant galaxies and clusters and galaxies are all receding from one another at a high speed, which actually increases as you look farther and farther away from us.<endOfText>
<human>If we sort of reverse things in our minds eye, and look backwards into the past history of the universe, we can come to a time where apparently all the material in the universe would have been on top of itself, that it would all have been squeezed into a point, and this moment sometimes people call the big bang, or the initial singularity.<endOfText>
<bot>And it's that moment which, when we trace the expansion backwards, will have occurred between about fifteen and eighteen billion years ago, but we can't say what, if anything, may have happened before that, whether the universe bounced out into another state of expansion, so we have a sort of a cut off in our ability to retrodict , or extrapolate backwards into the past.<endOfText>
<human>The uncertainty in the number that I gave you, about fifteen to eighteen billion years, is not in any sense an error due to inaccuracies of measurements of the rate at which the universe is currently expanding, but there are systematic differences of opinion about how one should calibrate the expansion rate, because people have different means of measuring the distance from us of the most luminous objects.<endOfText>
<bot>When one calculates, for example, the beginning of the universe, using the methods you described, surely you're making great assumptions about the laws of physics not having changed?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, that's certainly the case.<endOfText>
<bot>One doesn't always have to make those assumptions, of course.<endOfText>
<human>One thing worth remarking about this is cosmology and astronomy in general is very unusual science in the sense that when we observe very distant objects in the universe we are observing the universe actually as it was in the past, because the light that's coming towards us from a distant galaxy or cluster of galaxies actually left that object maybe millions or billions of years ago.<endOfText>
<bot>When we see a distant galaxy we're not seeing it as it is today, we're seeing it as it was a long time ago.<endOfText>
<human>So when we say we want the laws of physics perhaps to stay constant in time, when we observe these objects a long way away we're observing the laws of physics as they were a long time ago.<endOfText>
<bot>But not close to several billion years ago?<endOfText>
<human>Almost, but erm one could certainly arrive at a situation of the sort you're imagining that we want to be sure that when we look at some very exotic phenomena in the past of the universe, which has no parallel on earth, erm or in our vicinity, how can we be sure that the laws of physics that we've deduced on earth really apply?<endOfText>
<bot>How do we know that the laws of nature are not really like laws of a game of chess, but played on a chess board where the laws change as you go from place to place on the chess board, which is a very more complicated situation than an ordinary chess game where the laws are the same no matter where the pieces are.<endOfText>
<human>And I think all we can say is that we can't be sure that that isn't the case.<endOfText>
<bot>There is no evidence that the laws are different in the past than they are today, that they're different in different places erm, but one can investigate the possibility.<endOfText>
<human>It's possible to formulate theories of very simple aspects of physics where the laws or the strengths of different forces, say like gravity, actually change from place to place and make predictions as to what the observable consequences should be, erm and to a very degree of accuracy one concludes that the strengths of the forces of nature and the laws and the rules of the game are not changing from place to place.<endOfText>
<bot>They may be of course, but we may not have looked in the right place yet to find that.<endOfText>
<human>I think it would be very exciting if they were changing, but I'm afraid one has to be a reluctant revolutionary at the moment — there really is no evidence for that view.<endOfText>
<bot>I think really what happens when you go into the past is not so much that the laws that we now use change, but we just find that there are many more new rules and particles and things that can happen, so the things that we know are the same, but there are many, many more different types of interaction and particle in nature which we have no experience of, which we have to take into account.<endOfText>
<human>If we go back to the first few minutes, or maybe even the first few seconds, there must have been an incredibly high density of matter near that point?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, today the density of the universe is remarkably low.<endOfText>
<human>If you were to smooth out all the material there is in the universe into a uniform sort of sea of particles, you would find that the density was just about one atom in every cubic metre, which is far better than the best vacuum that you can ever make on earth by artificial means.<endOfText>
<bot>As you go backwards in time, to say the first minute of the universe's life, the density is not absurdly high, it's only a little more than that of water, but the density of radiation is much, much higher — it's a million times higher — and the temperature is like the inside of a nuclear reactor, so one of the interesting things is that when we get back to just a minute, say, after the apparent beginning of the expansion, we're not yet dealing with any bizarre physics, we're dealing with conditions that we know and understand on earth.<endOfText>
<human>However, if we keep on going, extrapolating backwards into the past, when we get to about a tenth of a second, or a hundredth of a second after the beginning, if we want to push earlier than that we've got to start using physics which we cannot test directly on earth.<endOfText>
<bot>We reach densities approaching that of the atomic nucleus, so it's about one hundredth of a second after the start that there is a real threshold.<endOfText>
<human>After that we use ordinary physics that we know and love and understand, but before that time we're working with uncertain physics and uncertain cosmology.<endOfText>
<bot>But there is a bonus to that in that people hope that by testing their ideas about the uncertain physics, by building models of that early stage, that those models will have consequences for the things that get left behind in the universe for the present, and so they might be able to test their ideas about how matter behaves at very high density by using cosmology, and that's very important because we have no other way of doing it.<endOfText>
<human>Also, it's worth adding, it's a very, very cheap way of doing it.<endOfText>
<bot>John, what's the chance of finding intelligent life out in the universe?<endOfText>
<human>Low, I think.<endOfText>
<bot>I think one can put forward fairly persuasive arguments that there are no life forms a good deal more advanced than ourselves in our galaxy, simply because I believe that social and environmental and sort of curiosity value factors would have led them to reveal their presence in various ways.<endOfText>
<human>It would be very easy for an advanced civilization to produce self-reproducing space probes, which would very quickly explore a large fraction of the galaxy.<endOfText>
<bot>There could, of course, be many civilizations similar to our own.<endOfText>
<human>It would be very difficult to detect them.<endOfText>
<bot>I have rather perhaps eccentric views about this, I don't feel that we ought to be advertising our presence to external civilizations.<endOfText>
<human>Our experience of what happens one earth when very superior culture groups meet very inferior culture groups is rather alarming.<endOfText>
<bot>Perhaps we ought to be spending time developing camouflage, rather than advertising our presence.<endOfText>
<human>It's always an assumption that intelligence goes hand in hand with benevolence and high moral values.<endOfText>
<bot>I think there's probably a strong argument against that in human history, and I think we shouldn't naively expect these very intelligence creatures to be benevolently disposed towards us.<endOfText>
<human>Another interesting idea that has been suggested is that there are extra terrestrials who are very intelligent.<endOfText>
<bot>They haven't revealed their presence because our solar system is being treated rather like a nature reserve — that they don't want to interpose themselves and spoil a very classic example of study of a lesser civilization growing up.<endOfText>
<human>But I think this is  it's very close to science fiction — it's very hard to think of any biological argument which makes the probability of intelligent life evolving high.<endOfText>
<bot>Astronomers tend to always think the probability is high because they think there are so many sites on which life could develop, but the biologists take completely the opposite view, that there are so many evolutionary pathways that lead to biological dead ends, that this outweighs the number of sites on which life could develop.<endOfText>
<human>So I think the biologists would tend to say no, there is no advanced intelligent life probably in our galaxy.<endOfText>
<bot>Astronomers probably lean towards the idea that yes there is, and there are currently searches, I believe, in the United States erm beaming signals with characteristic wavelengths, erm in the hope that extra terrestrials will see them.<endOfText>
<human>Lastly, John, one of the observations I would make is that a lot of astronomers I know are people who seem to have quite strong religious convictions.<endOfText>
<bot>Is there anything about astronomy which makes people inclined in that direction?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, it's an interesting point.<endOfText>
<bot>I erm haven't done a survey of this, but from my experience of meeting people in different universities I do get the impression that there tends to be many people of a religious persuasion, whereas in the sciences of the very small, biology and so on, there is not.<endOfText>
<human>Of course the problem is whether erm people enter those subjects because of their religious interests, or erm whether their religious interest develops as a result of studying those subjects, but I think certainly in this country there are a large number of people who are Christians and have a religious interest who are in the astronomical sciences.<endOfText>
<bot>This may also be because those subjects appear to offer fewer possible problems with regard to reconciling our behaviour, or everyday life, our origins perhaps, with other beliefs.<endOfText>
<human>One is not going to run into any social or economic or moral consequences of quasars, but you will, if you work in DNA replication erm and other areas of the physical sciences.<endOfText>
<bot>But I think, looking back in history, there has always been a erm strong erm religious motivation behind many of the past great scientists, like Newton, erm Boyle, Maxwell, Calvin — these are all people who had a very strong religious motivation erm behind their investigations, and if you look back in history still further, there is a strong case to be made that the reason why science was so dramatically successful in the west was because there was a strong belief in monotheistic religion, that people believe that the world had been created in an ordered way by a deity and so there really were laws of nature to be discovered, whereas if you study what happened in the Far East, for example, in China, the Chinese, you remember, were well ahead of the west in science at about the tenth century.<endOfText>
<human>They had gunpowder and very sophisticated engineering devices well before the west, but one can document the fact that the Chinese gave up science, rather dramatically, erm in subsequent centuries, simply because they lost faith that there was any underlying order in nature to be discovered, that it was their background religion and philosophy which led them to give up the idea of unravelling the structure of the universe.<endOfText>
<bot>They didn't think there was any law and order to be unravelled.<endOfText>
<human>And then when you look back to the Greeks, for example, here you have a culture that was dramatically successful in mathematics and logic and philosophy, but actually very unsuccessful in science, and there again you have a society which has nature guards erm and so nature is not a valid object for study.<endOfText>
<bot>You can't study botany if you believe in erm flower got .<endOfText>
<human>John, thank you very much.<endOfText>
<bot>Next Sunday we shall be exploring another important boundary in science.<endOfText>
<human>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<endOfText>
<bot>On this occasion I can, without any distortion, offer you a very warm welcome <endOfText>
<human>to this, which is the thirty ninth in the series of great centenary lectures, which we inaugurated in nineteen hundred and seventy, which was very early in the life of the Centre for Continuing Education.<endOfText>
<bot>As some of you will know by this time, the Centre provides custom-build courses, day schools, residential schools and other projects, for thousands of adult students in this region — mainly at locations scattered throughout the area, towns and villages of Sussex, but some here on the campus — and by so doing it tries to provide a strong functional link that helps to keep the university in touch with the community.<endOfText>
<human>Some might be tempted to say in touch with reality, but I think I'd prefer on this occasion to say in touch with another dimension of reality.<endOfText>
<bot>And we hope that the influence and the benefits are reciprocal.<endOfText>
<human>Now as part of all this, the Centre is responsible for almost all the public lectures in the university, and we have been glad to make the open to the public at large, and therefore a very special welcome to those of you who have come in from outside.<endOfText>
<bot>Now in planning the series of centenary lectures for this session, I was very delighted to discover that this was James Joyce's centenary year, and therefore had the chance at last to promote a lecture on him.<endOfText>
<human>Personally I can almost  almost remember the days when erm Ulysses was a bound book only to be read in plain cover after having been smuggled through the customs at Folkestone, Dover or Newhaven.<endOfText>
<bot>These, you might say, were the days of innocence, hypocrisy and prejudice.<endOfText>
<human>I don't know whether they've gone.<endOfText>
<bot>I can even remember when Finnegans Wake was thought to be incomprehensible and the gentleman sitting on my right, George Craig, is almost, but not quite, my contemporary at this university and I was genuinely delighted when he agreed to take on the herculean task of giving a lecture  a centenary lecture on James Joyce.<endOfText>
<human>George, not unlike his subject, has spent about half his life in Ireland  west, north and south he tells me  I said why not Dublin and he says that's what I meant <endOfText>
<bot>and the rest of his life in France and England, although I'm not sure whether what drove him from Ireland was like that which drove his subjects from Ireland — no doubt we shall see.<endOfText>
<human>He has taught in schools and universities in Ireland and in France, and is now Reader in French in this university, having been here since nineteen sixty six.<endOfText>
<bot>I have it on unimpeachable authority that his abiding interest is the human voice — whether the one we hear when we speak, or the one that informs and sustains us whatever we read.<endOfText>
<human>His specific professional concern is to have been with Aspects of Modernism, which is says is a loose name which covers the creative disruption of all certainties about what reading is, what writing is and what words can do.<endOfText>
<bot>He has written on Malarmie , on Puste , on Beckett and on reading itself.<endOfText>
<human>George Craig on James Joyce.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you George.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you .<endOfText>
<bot>The subjects of the great centenaries lectures are, unsurprisingly, as diverse as human achievement, but in at least one respect they can, by and large, be spoken of together with widespread, if not indeed universal, recognition of their greatness.<endOfText>
<human>To adapt a famous phrase, ‘We may not know much about their art, but we know what we're supposed to like’ and the lecturer, quite properly, both confirms and extends this recognition, so that what we find is, again quite properly, something like celebration of unity.<endOfText>
<bot>It is a very good base to talk from and I would love to have it.<endOfText>
<human>What I have to recognise by contrast is that even now James Joyce, born a hundred years ago, brings not unity but division, nor does this division merely reflect some such crude opposition as highbrow and lowbrow, or even informed and uninformed.<endOfText>
<bot>It is, of course, normal that any artist who breaks with the patterns of the past should find a sharply divided response among readers at large .<endOfText>
<human>The very words ‘modern art’ still carry by themselves a charge strong enough to disturb, dishearten, or even repel, some before they've read a line or listened to a note of whatever work has been given this label.<endOfText>
<bot>It is worth remembering too that the reactions of those who accept to go further and try the new are not always quiet indicators of preference.<endOfText>
<human>Here we may meet, may ourselves have felt anger, revulsion, even hatred.<endOfText>
<bot>‘You've got to draw the line somewhere’ runs the old phrase.<endOfText>
<human>And so with Joyce we might talk, say, of the manageable stories of Dubliners and the still acceptable mixture of poignant retrospect and startling surges of feeling that mark the portrait of the artist as a young man.<endOfText>
<bot>But then we have to move with Ulysses to a huge spinning-top of words which defies such judgements and leaves us clutching at apparently familiar images which so sooner appear than they are gone.<endOfText>
<human>And finally we would come to Finnegans Wake, apparently mocking our very attempt to read by calling in question what is, I suppose, the most basic of all assumptions about writing, that whatever form it takes it will be made up essentially of recognisable words.<endOfText>
<bot>If then we have uneasy feelings about modern art, it looks as if Joyce must confirm them a thousandfold.<endOfText>
<human>Yet, even here, there is a puzzle, a strange, unplaceable something which doesn't quite fit with that account of the gradual driving out of the reader and the suggestion of a steady shift towards the rare and the difficult, for I would guess that anyone not put off in advance by suspicion or hearsay, anyone that is who has got as far as dipping into Ulysses, say, will have come hard up against things that are startlingly, even discomfortingly, recognisable.<endOfText>
<bot>Words, of course, phrases, images, sequences, which connect with the very core of our inner experience, whether at its humblest or at its grandest.<endOfText>
<human>And then again if agonisings about modern are seem to take us in one direction, the banning of books as  reminded us, takes us in quite another, and we have to remember that for all practical purposes it was indeed a banned book for nearly fifteen years, from the Twenties into the Thirties.<endOfText>
<bot>We are not, we think, so easily shocked now by the naming of the ways of need and desire, and that label too will be a poor guide to the kaleidoscopic experience which Ulysses draws us into.<endOfText>
<human>Here it would be tempting to assume, whether modestly or angrily, that there is another group of readers — the sophisticated, the expert, the professional, for whom such problems simply don't exist, or have long since been left behind.<endOfText>
<bot>These readers, the assumption might run, are at ease with the complexities of rhythm and vision, pattern and play, and united by this ease are free to discriminate more and more finally the detail of the smallest fragment or the structure or the entire work.<endOfText>
<human>You may well think indeed that I'm wasting your time in calling this an assumption rather than recognising it as a plain fact.<endOfText>
<bot>The critical and biographical studies already written to Joyce and his work would stop a sizeable bookshop.<endOfText>
<human>More are appearing all the time, and nineteen eighty two will be no more than a particularly rich year for them.<endOfText>
<bot>And nor is it simply a question of numbers — among these studies are some of the subtlest, most ingenious and most penetrating essays written in our time, and the factor common to almost all, the naive or the clumsy as well as the brilliant, is the conviction explicit or implicit that Joyce is an outstanding, indeed for some the outstanding, modern writer.<endOfText>
<human>The status of his work for some approaching that of the sacred book.<endOfText>
<bot>Surely here is, after all, that unity of celebration which earlier I claimed as missing.<endOfText>
<human>Not so.<endOfText>
<bot>I suggested a second or so ago that the ordinary reader, unsure of what to make of the shifting realities of Joyce's writing, might defensively assume that no such hesitations would trouble the experienced reader, but that is far from being a homogeneous class.<endOfText>
<human>Among experienced readers, including those most passionately concerned with modernism, there are some for whom Joyce occupies nothing like so central a position, some for whom the whole drift of the later work is radically misconceived, even a colossal mistake.<endOfText>
<bot>We are back again in disputed ground.<endOfText>
<human>In the bewildering tracery formed by the work and by the claims and counter-claims that it has provoked, there is matter for a hundred lectures, and what follows is neither and attempt to summarize, nor a rival undertaking.<endOfText>
<bot>I want rather, by focusing on a small number of closely related questions, and simple ones at that, to suggest something of how all this came about and why it matters.<endOfText>
<human>What I have to say would bear essentially on the four works named, and would be grouped round three notions which I shall call language as rescue, language as screen, and language as replay.<endOfText>
<bot>First rescue.<endOfText>
<human>One sense of that is obvious enough.<endOfText>
<bot>Everywhere in the stories that make up Joyce's first major work, Dubliners, we come across a double reality, an invariable focus on the precise detail of place and person, class and bearing, speech and gesture.<endOfText>
<human>The kind of attention that we usually associate with love or hate, and at the same time an acute awareness of limits, of closed worlds, of helplessness, of traps of unsatisfiable longing — the sort of awareness that we associate rather with pity or fear.<endOfText>
<bot>Even as we admire the sharpness, the delicacy, of the delineation, of this self-sacrificing old maid, that lowly and tormented man, this uncertain child — even as we admire, we see too the hopelessness that these so powerfully suggest.<endOfText>
<human>But because it is a writer who is giving us this, and a writer at the beginning of his career, what more natural than that we should see him as writing his way out of all this, as ‘getting it out of his system’ as we say, clearing the ground for work that will enact triumphantly his escape, his liberation, his hope.<endOfText>
<bot>And again and again in the stories comes the hint of separateness, of difference, as if to confirm this.<endOfText>
<human>Say, from the first story, The Sisters, a little moment like this one ‘It's bad for children’ said Old Cotter ‘because their minds are so impressionable.<endOfText>
<bot>When children see things like that, you know, it has an affect.’<endOfText>
<human>I crammed my mouth with  for fear I might give utterance to my anger.<endOfText>
<bot>Tiresome old red-nosed imbecile.’<endOfText>
<human>Or again that difference seen the other way round, as in these lines from the last great story, The Dead.<endOfText>
<bot>‘He stretched himself cautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife.<endOfText>
<human>One by one they were all becoming shades.<endOfText>
<bot>Better pass boldly into that other world in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age.<endOfText>
<human>He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her heart for so many years that image of her lover's eyes when he had told her that he did not wish to love.<endOfText>
<bot>Generous tears filled Gabriel's eyes.<endOfText>
<human>He had never felt like that himself towards any woman, but he knew that such a feeling must be love.<endOfText>
<bot>The tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping tree.<endOfText>
<human>Other forms were near.<endOfText>
<bot>His sole had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead.<endOfText>
<human>He was conscious of, but could not apprehend, their wayward and flickering existence.’<endOfText>
<bot>The beauty of these words cannot entirely hide a sense of suggested differentness, of an essential something so far held back but pushing now to get out.<endOfText>
<human>It is this sense which seems to be given the clearest possible confirmation in those moments of the portrait of the artist, where the brooding Stephen, Stephen Daedalus , suddenly emerges from his vigilance in a lightening display of strength.<endOfText>
<bot>Here, from the portrait, are two of them.<endOfText>
<human>‘It's a curious thing, do you know’ Cranley said dispassionately, ‘how your mind is supersaturated with the religion in which you say you disbelief.<endOfText>
<bot>Did you believe it when you were at school?<endOfText>
<human>I bet you did.’<endOfText>
<bot>‘I did’, Stephen answered.<endOfText>
<human>‘And were you happier then?’<endOfText>
<bot>Cranley asked softly.<endOfText>
<human>‘Happier than you are now, for instance?’<endOfText>
<bot>‘Often happy’ Stephen said ‘and often unhappy.’<endOfText>
<human>‘I was someone else then.’<endOfText>
<bot>‘How someone else?<endOfText>
<human>What do you mean by that statement?’<endOfText>
<bot>‘I mean’, said Stephen, ‘that I was not myself as I am now, as I had to become.’<endOfText>
<human>‘Oh this again.’<endOfText>
<bot>Stephen walked on alone and out into the quiet of Kildare Street.<endOfText>
<human>Opposite Maples Hotel he stood to wait, patient again, the name of the hotel a colourless, polished wood, and it's colourless quiet front stung him like a glance of polite disdain.<endOfText>
<bot>He stared angrily back and the softly lit drawing room of the hotel, in which he imagined the sleek lives of the patricians of Ireland, housed in calm.<endOfText>
<human>They thought of army commissions and land agents.<endOfText>
<bot>Peasants greeted them along the roads in the country.<endOfText>
<human>They knew the names of certain French dishes and gave orders to Jarveys in high pitched provincial voices, which pierced through their skin-tight accents.<endOfText>
<bot>How could he hit their conscience?<endOfText>
<human>How cast his shadow over the imaginations of their daughters before their squires beget upon them that they might breed a race less ignoble than their own?<endOfText>
<bot>And under the deepened dusk he felt the thoughts and desires of the race to which he belonged flitting like bats across the dark country bogs.’<endOfText>
<human>And I've still not quoted the best known of those displays of otherness — these we shall come to later.<endOfText>
<bot>For the moment let me repeat that what all this seems to point to as natural is the self-imposed exile which will allow the artist figure, whether Stephen or Joyce himself, to create a new world, with the language of the writer as his ticket, his lifeline, his rescue.<endOfText>
<human>But strong though that thrust is, it is not rescue in that sense that I want to argue for here.<endOfText>
<bot>Bear with me for a moment more as I come towards it, while I read you yet more lines from another moment of the portrait, and keep in mind, if you will, from a moment ago, Stephen's contemptuous review of the holders of wealth and power in Ireland.<endOfText>
<human>‘Often as he sat in Davin's rooms in Grantham Street, wondering at his friend's well made boots that flanked the wall pair by pair, and repeating for his friend's simple ear the verses and cadences of others which with the veils of his own longing dejection, the rude pheoboric mind of his listener had drawn his mind towards it and flung it back again, drawing it by a quiet inbred courtesy of attention, or by a quaint turn of Old English speech, or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skills, for Davin had sat at the feet of Michael Cussack the game, repelling it swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence, or by a bluntness of feeling, or by a dull stare of terror in the eyes, the terror of sole of starving Irish village in which the curfew was still a nightly fear.<endOfText>
<bot>Side by side, with his memory of the deeds of prowess, of his Uncle Matt Davin , the athlete, the young peasant worshipped the sorrowful legend of Ireland.<endOfText>
<human>His muse had taught him Irish — his nurse had taught him Irish, beg your pardon  — and shaped his rude imagination by the broken lights of Irish myth.<endOfText>
<bot>Whatsoever of thought or feeling came to him from England, or by way of English culture, his mind stood armed against in obedience to a password, and of the world that lay beyond England he knew only the Foreign Legion of France in which he spoke of serving.<endOfText>
<human>One night the young peasant, his spirit stunned by the violent or luxurious language in which Stephen escaped from the cold silence of intellectual revolt, had called up before Stephen's mind a strange vision.<endOfText>
<bot>The two were walking slowly towards Davin's room.<endOfText>
<human>‘A thing happened to myself Stevie, last autumn, coming on winter and I never told it to a living soul.<endOfText>
<bot>And you are the first person now I ever told it to.<endOfText>
<human>I disremember if it was October or November — it was October, 'cos it was before I came up here to join the matriculation class.’<endOfText>
<bot>Stephen had turned his smiling eyes towards his friend's face, flattered by his confidence and won over to sympathy by the speaker's simple accent.’<endOfText>
<human>Now there is more to this passage than either the story that it heralds, poignant and memorable though that is, or the condescending tone of the last sentence, for the innocence Davin embodies brings to Stephen as a brute fact from the real world the missing half of a truth which Stephen has known but so far been unable to admit even to himself, and which will go on mattering to Joyce for many years.<endOfText>
<bot>For as long as a Stephen, in his moments of strength, has been able to despise the arbiters of fortune and culture — the English and the Anglo Irish — as degenerate and unworthy inheritors of the language of Shakespeare, he has done so from somewhere, from a somewhere intimately known, and yet never entirely placed, from what might loosely be called Irishness.<endOfText>
<human>Standing on that base, felt as solid but as yet unexamined, he can look ahead of him at the task, which is writing, in possession of the means to carry out that task, which is his language, but suddenly that vision is revealed as fantasy.<endOfText>
<bot>Stephen cannot stand alone facing the task and the world, quietly, unassumingly,Davin has appeared behind him.<endOfText>
<human>Davin , whatever his limitations, is standing on and in an Irishness which can be and is described and mapped, which is not a neutral zone, and which feeds and is fed by a language.<endOfText>
<bot>The world is in front of Stephen and behind him, as in some terrible children's game he is caught in the middle of a circle, in a kind of nowhere.<endOfText>
<human>He has no language, only an awareness of the languages of others.<endOfText>
<bot>erm anyone who has read the Portrait of the Artist will know the dizzying swings of feeling that chart Stephen's progress from arrogance to abjectness, from despair to hope, from self-sufficiency, to the craving for comfort, or the voluptuousness of renunciation.<endOfText>
<human>And they can all be tied to episodes or events, sexual experience, hurt pride, felt guilt, ecstatic awareness.<endOfText>
<bot>I want only to suggest that however closely those match, however complete they are, therefore, in the pairs they form, they all also work as imagines of the writer's relation to language, now confident, now uncertain, now lonely, now roistering and so on.<endOfText>
<human>And this is something more than a literary point.<endOfText>
<bot>Indeed, it is because it can't be a literary point for Joyce or for anyone from Ireland who's business is words, because language forever figures urgent and personal issues of belonging, of debt, of loss, of freedom and of dependence, because it is and does all this.<endOfText>
<human>The very notion of making a literary point about the writer's relation to language, however true, will have a cruelly mocking echo.<endOfText>
<bot>What then can this Stephen, who is so piercingly aware of these things, and yet who proposes to be a writer, what can he do?<endOfText>
<human>If he is to write at all he must, in the final irony, turn to language.<endOfText>
<bot>Something of that strange  that strangeness and that irony lies behind the famous claim ‘I will try to express myself in some mode of life for art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to use — silence, exile and cunning.<endOfText>
<human>Among the many things we hear in that oracular phrase is, against the odds, a bitterly won conception of language as rescue.<endOfText>
<bot>I suggested a little time ago that the surface indications offered both by Joyce's life and by his writing up to including The Portrait — he does leave Ireland to live with his Nora in Triest, in Switzerland, in France, in Switzerland again, until his death in nineteen forty one, visiting Dublin for the last time in nineteen hundred and twelve — he does give us in Dubliners and The Portrait a sharp sense of the traps he feels he must escape from, the church tentacular, pervasive, the seedy provincialism, the narrowness, the philistine complacency.<endOfText>
<human>I suggested that the evidence seemed, in the context of language as rescue, to promise a whole new set of preoccupations, to a point where even those undertakings Stephen had given to rework the stiff clay of his race, even these can seem unduly influenced by his still being among them.<endOfText>
<bot>But if it makes easy sense when we learn that after the ground clearing achieved in the early publications Joyce sets to work on an enormous new fictional venture, guesses about new preoccupations and the leaving behind of old collapse in face of the reality of Ulysses, for in it we read, among a thousand turnings and an wanderings, of a single day, the sixteenth of June nineteen hundred and four, in Dublin, and how two characters, separately and together, live out that day among the welter of their acquaintance, their needs and deeds and thoughts, their places of refuge and of risk, and if one of these two, Leopold Bloom, is new, the other is Stephen Daedalus, and Dublin is everywhere in the novel, almost to the point where everywhere is Dublin.<endOfText>
<human>Is Joyce then moving back, rather than moving on?<endOfText>
<bot>Both the terms and the meaning of that question are less simple than they seem.<endOfText>
<human>It is time we took up the second of my headings, language as screen.<endOfText>
<bot>There too there is no straightforward unchallengeable meaning, but let's see how far we can get with one immediately obvious sense of screen — that it is a something, noticeable in itself, behind which other things happen.<endOfText>
<human>And the language of Ulysses is noticeable in countless ways, taking now to the staccato bursts of signal flickering half thoughts, or the ebb and flow of daydream, now to extended disputation, now to pastiche, now to grotesque imaginings, now to the flattest or the sharpest of conversational exchanges.<endOfText>
<bot>The shifts in pace, in tone, in level, come at us without warning, so that even as one part of the brain tries to grasp at this or that, to make sense of it before moving on, the rest responds to the exhilaration of being swept along the verbal equivalent of a ghost railway.<endOfText>
<human>For among the effects is one that is new, and that nothing that I've said so far could have suggested this very exuberance, as well as the things it plays on, can make us smile or laugh.<endOfText>
<bot>Take this tiny sample: Leopold Bloom, the Dublin Jew, with his touching mixture of timorousness and courage, has looked in for a few moments at a church as a Mass is ending.<endOfText>
<human>We grasp the occasion only through the disjointed reflections.<endOfText>
<bot>Some of that old sacred music is splendid,mercadante , seven last words, Mozart's Twelfth Mass, the glory in that.<endOfText>
<human>Those old popes were keen on music, on art, and statues and pictures of all kinds.<endOfText>
<bot>Palestrena , for example, too.<endOfText>
<human>They had a gay old time while it lasted, healthy too, chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs  benedictine, green chartreuse.<endOfText>
<bot>Still having eunuchs in the choirs that was coming it a bit thick.<endOfText>
<human>What kind of voice is it?<endOfText>
<bot>It must be curious to hear after their own strong bases — connoisseurs.<endOfText>
<human>I suppose they wouldn't feel anything after <endOfText>
<bot>Kind of a placet, no worry.<endOfText>
<human>Fall into flesh, don't they?<endOfText>
<bot>Gluttons, tall, long legs — who knows.<endOfText>
<human>Eunuch — one way out of it.<endOfText>
<bot>Well consider again this brief moment, where we're given a new glimpse of someone last seen surrounded by a God-like power, the rector of Clongoes , where the young and impressionable Stephen had been to school.<endOfText>
<human>‘He walked by the tree shade of sunny winking leaves, and towards him came the wife of Mr David Shehee MP.<endOfText>
<bot>‘Very well indeed, Father.<endOfText>
<human>And you Father?’<endOfText>
<bot>Oh Father Conmey was wonderfully well, indeed.<endOfText>
<human>He would go to Buxton, probably, for the waters and her boys would be getting on well at Belvedere.<endOfText>
<bot>Was that so.<endOfText>
<human>Father Conmey was very glad indeed to hear that.<endOfText>
<bot>And Mr Shehee himself?<endOfText>
<human>The house was still sitting — to be sure it was.<endOfText>
<bot>Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed.<endOfText>
<human>Yes it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes, a very great success.<endOfText>
<human>A wonderful man really.’<endOfText>
<bot>And from such moments as these we will be whirled to the uproarious, the piercing, the magdalen, the strange and the voluptuous.<endOfText>
<human>Our screen, then, is no colourless obstacle, but a bewilderingly decorated surface that constantly draws our attention, tempting us with the thought that here is all.<endOfText>
<bot>That to read the novel is to attend exclusively to the detail of a patterning.<endOfText>
<human>And there are many readers, quick and subtle ones, for whom that is so, and for whom, of course, the sense of screen, which I have been suggesting, can serve no purpose.<endOfText>
<bot>At the same time, this screen, these games with and in words, can even now frighten off those readers who feel they must always know where they are when they read, or irritate those who see the games as a form of deliberate teasing or provocation.<endOfText>
<human>But since it is part of my intention to suggest how and why the work of Joyce provokes exceptional division among its readers, I shall, for that reason and for others which will emerge, keep the notion of screen in front of you.<endOfText>
<bot>And that takes us to the question of what it is that might be going on behind the screen — a question which leads not only forward and to Ulysses and beyond, but backwards, into a reconsideration of Dubliners and The Portrait of the Artist.<endOfText>
<human>For if, as I suggested, the enormous vitality of the language of Ulysses can, among other things, make us smile and even laugh out loud, that fact alone will underscore how little room there is for laughter in the earlier texts.<endOfText>
<bot>Is this, then, the rescue that I spoke of?<endOfText>
<human>That certainly would fit very well with the familiar notion of a writer shaking off the anguished preoccupations of childhood and adolescence, free now in his maturity to put ironic distance between himself and that world, but it won't do.<endOfText>
<bot>Let me catch up here some points left in suspension.<endOfText>
<human>There is first the fascinated attention we find in the stories that make up Dubliners.<endOfText>
<bot>I suggested that the insistent gaze, the awareness of detail, were of the kind we associate with love or hate, while the persistent emphasis on traps or limits that can never be crossed belonged rather with the very different forces of pity or fear.<endOfText>
<human>Now these don't just add up or cancel out.<endOfText>
<bot>The common claim the that the stories are remarkable for their even tone seems to me to miss the point.<endOfText>
<human>Love and hate are violent.<endOfText>
<bot>They get things done.<endOfText>
<human>Pity and fear slow us down, or send us away.<endOfText>
<bot>But there is one kind of feeling that can hold them all together — desperation.<endOfText>
<human>Not despair, not that last wild flailing about before we disappear into the pit, but desperation.<endOfText>
<bot>In it we cannot go to any of the extremes because we are aware of them all.<endOfText>
<human>We are pulled this way and that, but the effect of these contradictory pulls is to leave us fixed in the middle.<endOfText>
<bot>Now of course the stories are about people caught in this way.<endOfText>
<human>Such a one as Evelyn, who has the chance to escape with her Frank from the life of drudgery she has with her awful father.<endOfText>
<bot>Frank, going ahead of her to the boat, turns for her.<endOfText>
<human>‘She felt him seize her hand.<endOfText>
<bot>‘Come.’<endOfText>
<human>All the seas of the world tumbled about her heart.<endOfText>
<bot>He was drawing her into them.<endOfText>
<human>He would drown her.<endOfText>
<bot>She gripped with both hands at the iron railing.<endOfText>
<human>‘Come.’<endOfText>
<bot>No, no — it was impossible.’<endOfText>
<human>And Evelyn stays, and Frank is gone, and the story is done.<endOfText>
<bot>Evelyn and the others are, indeed, with greater or lesser urgency and awareness, immobile in desperation, but I want to suggest that for Joyce it is not the dispassionate artist's gaze which alone allows that strange steadiness commentators have called and even tone.<endOfText>
<human>It is not just the characters who know desperation.<endOfText>
<bot>It confronts and surrounds Joyce too.<endOfText>
<human>Now he it is, of course, who creates them, and by that very fact can claim to have moved triumphantly beyond immobility — the overall achievement of Dubliners, and within the stories the hints of differentness of which I spoke.<endOfText>
<bot>But what is for the most part in these stories a quiet desperation, is achieved at the cost of suppressing part of his own awareness, part of his own truth, and how bad that was we begin to see with The Portrait.<endOfText>
<human>Something else I've left hanging rather dangerously in the air is another and rather different hint, and because of the close correspondence of their careers, the milestones along their way, Stephen Daedalus is merely another name for James Joyce, so that the portrait itself would be a blow by blow account of its author's story so far, with the relevant identities politely concealed under pseudonyms.<endOfText>
<bot>Neither the one nor the other is the case.<endOfText>
<human>And this we come at not through consulting Joyce's biography, but through attending to the forces at work in his writing.<endOfText>
<bot>The space of desperation is a wide one, and if there is room in it for little stunted people, there is room too for figures that are a mile or an inch high.<endOfText>
<human>Stephen will be both.<endOfText>
<bot>If immobility is one of its effects, the swinging between the extremes that bound it — love and hate, pity and fear — is another, and that is how Stephen will move.<endOfText>
<human>And if given to us as actual temptations, the rather lure of the church, the Reverend Simon Stephen Daedalus SJ, and the lure of the flesh ‘He closed his eyes, surrendering himself to her body and mind, conscious of nothing in the world but the dark pressure of her softly parting lips’.<endOfText>
<bot>If these are given to us as actual temptations, there is no less of temptation in the resounding sentence that is the last but one of the portrait.<endOfText>
<human>‘I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.’<endOfText>
<bot>There, indeed, is Stephen hero, a young Titan, who is about to topple the gods.<endOfText>
<human>The serene and powerful artist figure, who remains within or beyond or above his handiwork.<endOfText>
<bot>Invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, paring his finger nails.<endOfText>
<human>But Joyce, his creator, is watching him as one of his own timorous school boys might watch a particularly daring companion, admiring, fearful, disapproving, conscious of unresolved guilt, above all divided.<endOfText>
<bot>Irishness and Englishness framed one difficulty from which language had to provide the rescue.<endOfText>
<human>Stephen has gone through confession, and is, he declares, ‘Ready to forge that language’, but he declares it in a language that will not yet take Joyce out of desperation.<endOfText>
<bot>What language will allow his confession to be made and yet not heard will by itself bring absolution and so release hi, yet all the while create his novel.<endOfText>
<human>It is as part answer to that question that I have put forward the notion of language as screen, the dazzling play of words and tones, fragments, sequences, movements this way and that — calls constantly to the eye and ear of the reader.<endOfText>
<bot>But even as eye and ear follow the darting changes here and there, as if they were the only reality, even as that happens we are made aware that the great screen is showing some sharply outlined human scene — the easy or awkward coming together of acquaintances in this pub, that cemetery, this newspaper office, that maternity hospital, library or brothel  the making and the unmaking of friendships and hopes — the experience of solitude.<endOfText>
<human>And then the scene itself divides.<endOfText>
<bot>In one version it is the highly particularized action of networks of people in the network of streets that is Dublin on one day and another, suggested to us as early as the title and continued through innumerable associations and hints, it is a vast and teeming world through which and erratic journeying is taking its course in space and time, inner and outer.<endOfText>
<human>These intimations of universal and particular timeless and now reach readers whether or not they have learned to call the sections of Ulysses by the names of episodes, characters, or places taken from the Odyssey.<endOfText>
<bot>Granted all that richness and diversity, to talk of language as screen may well seem simply perverse, even ungrateful, but just as we can't attend to the patterning without also seeing the patterns, the scenes, so the whole virtuoso performance is counterpointed by a performance of a different kind, the intricately woven language screen.<endOfText>
<human>Looked at from another angle is the grill of the confessional.<endOfText>
<bot>There is a murmur of many voices about it, but the one that comes through is not that of Stephen Daedalus, a little older now, but still recognisably kin to the Stephen of The Portrait, not his voice, but that of Leopold Bloom.<endOfText>
<human>Bloom is physically unimpressive, is incapable of Stephen's fierce intellectual of aesthetic leaps.<endOfText>
<bot>He lacks social adroitness, or any kind of personal magnetism, as he struggles to hold down a charmless job which depends on the goodwill of others.<endOfText>
<human>He is Jewish — that is condemned to be an outsider in a world which knows only the Catholic many and the Protestant few.<endOfText>
<bot>He is a husband who recites with dull pain the continuing succession of his wife's lovers, while he must comfort himself with fantasies — his own, or the kind printed on cheap paper.<endOfText>
<human>How can he matter?<endOfText>
<bot>In the screen of language the words that make him up are no more than some amongst many, a detail in the pattern, as a grotesque might be in early painting, or the straight man in a comic duo.<endOfText>
<human>But in the novel of which that screen is part, in the total enterprise, he matters very much and in different, crucial ways.<endOfText>
<bot>To start with, there is separate screening mechanism for Bloom himself.<endOfText>
<human>He is presented to us in the first instance, and decisively, but his failures, his weaknesses, his inadequacies.<endOfText>
<bot>The small, sad, trapped figures we met in Dubliners were, for the most part, you might say, given a quick deliverance, each firmly located within his or her narrow circle and then left.<endOfText>
<human>It is as if the economy, the restraint of much of the writing passed over onto them to give them a curious accidental dignity.<endOfText>
<bot>With Bloom the most secret stirrings of bowels or brains are exposed.<endOfText>
<human>The defeats and backslidings are not only those forced on him by others, or by circumstances, but those too, less pitiably, which come from within him.<endOfText>
<bot>It is as if he were all The Dubliners rolled into one.<endOfText>
<human>He is everybody's butt, not least that of his wife, Molly.<endOfText>
<bot>Yet, too keenly aware of his own different failings, to be able to outface them all.<endOfText>
<human>Such aspirations as he has are short-lived, stick almost in the throat, as the notes of the song might in the throat of an unconfident would-be singer.<endOfText>
<bot>And so gently, uncertainly, yet doggedly, he makes his way along through this day as, we must suppose, through the whole of his life thus far.<endOfText>
<human>Why then, given all this, do we see and hear so much of him?<endOfText>
<bot>If he can be put in his place by anyone, young or old, male or female, why do we come across him everywhere?<endOfText>
<human>Can the great Odysseus , strong and decisive, have shrunk to this Ulysses?<endOfText>
<bot>Well the obvious explanation is that that is the point that our modern hero, the connecting thread that runs through the whole design, can have none of the grandeur of the ancient one.<endOfText>
<human>But again, and in more than one sense, we see too much of Bloom for that to be the whole explanation.<endOfText>
<bot>We can get a little further by remembering that the affect of the screen is to present him by way of his weaknesses and limitations.<endOfText>
<human>So unambiguously marked are these, that they draw attention away from other features of his — his odd stock of knowledge and his quiet eagerness to increase it — his unassuming inclination for the arts, and particularly music  something different from the practical awareness that comes from being married to a singer — his compassion — his steadfastness.<endOfText>
<bot>We do not always laugh when all or any mock him.<endOfText>
<human>We do not always dismiss him when he is left trailing by the brilliant or the powerful.<endOfText>
<bot>I have suggested already that he is all The Dubliners combined — the lost child, the resigned girl, the lonely or frustrated man, the seeker of false comfort — now I want to come at his importance from a different angle.<endOfText>
<human>The Stephen of The Portrait also knows intermittent humiliation — the brutality of school fellows, or teachers, the sole grinding slide into poverty, the self-revulsion at sexual indulgence, the after effects of surrender to the embodied authority of priests, the awareness of cultural isolation.<endOfText>
<bot>But however low he is brought, the urgent forward and upward drive of the writing gives us such moments as stages on the way to eventual triumph.<endOfText>
<human>The humiliations may show us the strength of the opposition which the world, temporal and spiritual, sets up against him, but they promise too the kind of imaginative and moral strength which will raise him about it.<endOfText>
<bot>They herald those final reverberant sentences in The Portrait.<endOfText>
<human>But I suggested too that the resolution — this resolution — was something that Joyce saw and wrote, not something he yet new.<endOfText>
<bot>Stephen can confess his weaknesses, but he can go on to say ‘You talk to me of nationality, language, religion.<endOfText>
<human>I shall try to fly by those nets.’<endOfText>
<bot>He can break out of the space of desperation.<endOfText>
<human>For Joyce there is unresolved business.<endOfText>
<bot>There is first the admission of cravings, sexual and other, felt as unspeakably ignoble, and there is the unappeased fear that the very gifts on whose existence all rescue depends might be mere fantasy, delusion.<endOfText>
<human>That he may be destined to drift helplessly, tormented by unrealisable and therefore useless dreams.<endOfText>
<bot>A bit of a singer, a bit of an artist, a bit of a man.<endOfText>
<human>If Bloom is every kind of Dubliner it is because it falls to him to transact the unfinished business, to enact it and to get beyond it without dazzling gifts.<endOfText>
<bot>As he makes his way along within the quiet desperation of his life, he must reveal himself to us as cuckold, fetishist, masochist, outsider, victim, inferior, loser.<endOfText>
<human>Only that order of revelation of confession will permit recognition.<endOfText>
<bot>Bloom is not, and will not become, a hero.<endOfText>
<human>He is not Joyce any more or any less than Stephen is, but Stephen can only fly by the nets of nationality, language, religion and artistic mediocrity because Bloom cannot.<endOfText>
<bot>Bloom must accept a particular life so that Joyce need not, and Stephen must be shown in his byronic self-deception so that Joyce need not.<endOfText>
<human>The stories of Dubliners are not only disturbingly sharp representations from outside, they are fed too from inside by an intuitive closeness, an awareness that comes near to identification with these and those victims, male and female.<endOfText>
<bot>Stephen and Bloom are brought together in the final stages of Ulysses so that at last the space of desperation can be closed, the vertical pull of Stephen's iron ambition, set against the downward sucking force of Blooms ordinariness.<endOfText>
<human>The new writing can go forward without being founded on a central lie.<endOfText>
<bot>The most famous of all the sections of Ulysses, Molly Bloom's final soliloquy is above all a celebration of that freedom, and the freedom thus won.<endOfText>
<human>Molly is not every woman, or indeed any woman.<endOfText>
<bot>She is, above all, Joyce's central recognition, exultant recognition that yearning is not defeat and identification is not a proof of some fatal inner yielding to the pull of mediocrity.<endOfText>
<human>The vivid renderings of human prisons that we find in Dubliners are intensified, I have argued by secret sharings.<endOfText>
<bot>And the deepest of those secret sharings are with the child figure, the earliest stories of course, and with the women.<endOfText>
<human>Evelyn, or Maria, in the story Clay, or the nameless girl in Two Gallants, or Greta Conroy in The Dead.<endOfText>
<bot>For these above all, the culture insists, must hide their wound beyond the receiving end of experience, whatever their gifts or desires.<endOfText>
<human>The issue of identification takes off, we have seen, in a different direction in The Portrait.<endOfText>
<bot>For here the emphasis is on the emergence of Stephen's strength from the very depth of his own weakness.<endOfText>
<human>But as we also saw, that strength comes too soon, denies too much.<endOfText>
<bot>It is indeed still there, to be built on, in Ulysses in the further elaboration of Stephen, but it cannot be fully achieved unless the wounds are acknowledged.<endOfText>
<human>And now it is a man of sorts who carries that acknowledgement.<endOfText>
<bot>A man who is a new kind of victim, Bloom the Jew, the semi-talented outcast.<endOfText>
<human>But I said too a man of sorts, for the acknowledgement now includes crippled masculinity, and with that Joyce is free to embody and enact a different fear hinted at before in, for example, The Dead, but masked by the victim's status of the woman thrust on so cruelly by the culture.<endOfText>
<bot>But the culture can be not only cruel but stupid.<endOfText>
<human>What if real sexual freedom, real potency, real power, belonged in fact with the woman?<endOfText>
<bot>Molly's mixture of self-loving languor and irrepressible vitality is a splendid realization in its own right, but it also conjures a profound fear.<endOfText>
<human>And so it comes about, at the end of all the wanderings, that we find under one roof, in decaying Echo Street, that strangest of couples, Molly and Leopold Bloom and Stephen Daedalus.<endOfText>
<bot>Now at last dream and reality, part and whole, strong and weak, art and life, active and passive, can be confronted.<endOfText>
<human>Joyce has pulled together the separation representations of his inner world, achieved his rescue and finished his novel — cause indeed for celebration.<endOfText>
<bot>But there is a world of difference between celebration and victory.<endOfText>
<human>If there is any one awareness common to the great modern writers, it is that language will not do our bidding, that good or bad intentions do not so much pave roads, as poke up odd coloured weeds through the roadway.<endOfText>
<bot>That something actually achieved in writing gives no assurance, to reassurance for any writing still to be done.<endOfText>
<human>It is a version of something we all know now, and largely thanks to them.<endOfText>
<bot>For if, as ordinary people, we are acutely aware that when it most matters the words we say are not thunderbolts from heaven but hostages to fortune, ways in which we reveal ourselves in our limitedness and imperfection.<endOfText>
<human>If we are aware of this, we at least know that it must always have been so.<endOfText>
<bot>What in their different ways a , a , an Eliot, a Kafka or a Beckett — what they have had to come to terms with his the death of a tenacious pervasive yet curiously imprecise myth that somehow writing was different, that the masters of the past could in some way overcome this limitedness, that writing carried its own justification.<endOfText>
<human>With the myth gone, they were faced rather with what Eliot called the intolerable wrestle with words and meanings, or, as Beckett was to put it, nothing to express, nothing with which to express nothing, from which to express, no power to express, no desire to express, together with the obligation to express.<endOfText>
<bot>In this perspective to set up as a writer at all is an extraordinary act, while artist becomes a word only to be invoked only of others, never about the self.<endOfText>
<human>Yet it is just this act which Joyce accepted to do.<endOfText>
<bot>The energy and the single-mindedness with which, following on the achievement of Ulysses, he carried it through can still amaze us.<endOfText>
<human>For if, as I have argued, the dual difficulty of Englishness versus Irishness and of the divided self had lent and existential urgency to aesthetic ambitions and convictions, that urgency had surely gone.<endOfText>
<bot>Dublin and the past had been exorcised, even as the new fiction had been created.<endOfText>
<human>But creation and the means of creation had thrown up a new an utterly unexpected difficulty.<endOfText>
<bot>If Joyce's energy had been concentrated in the forging of a language adequate to resolve all that had been, then that language, whatever else it had done, had achieved something for him.<endOfText>
<human>Something remained out there which had not been subjected to the same refining fire.<endOfText>
<bot>That something was language itself.<endOfText>
<human>It is to the netting of that protean reality that Joyce now bends all his energies, and my mixing of metaphors can give no more than the faintest hint of what that strange act entails.<endOfText>
<bot>It is this that I had in mind in proposing at the outset my three notions and calling one of them, the last, language as replay.<endOfText>
<human>Replay — somewhere between re-run, the taking up again of a game, return match, and revenge — somewhere in that space is the verbal world called Finnegans Wake.<endOfText>
<bot>Within the frame that we have never left, Dublin, and which we meet again in the opening sentence, is to be enacted strange as the dreaming that permeates it, Joyce's relation to his languages, to language.<endOfText>
<human>Past, present, future, here, there, inner, outer, self, other, quotation, allusion, portmanteau word, syllable, letter and grunt — all whirl about two poles, their names forever changing, their enduringness graspable only by initials, A L P — the river, the Liffey, the woman and H C E, the man.<endOfText>
<bot>And as in Dreams separate realities can fuse in a single image or sequence, so here words fuse as Joyce attempts to cast in a single form the body of his culture, the depth, variety, the body of his feelings — the feelings of his body.<endOfText>
<human>Here indeed is the  assault on the gods, Stephen's boast unimaginably extended.<endOfText>
<bot>In view of this, it would be no more than proper and right for me to talk in some  in great detail about it, but I am not going to, and not just because I have an eye on the clock, or an ear for the protest of stomachs.<endOfText>
<human>Perhaps I can explain, and in order to explain I'll tell you a story, a literary story.<endOfText>
<bot>When we read Eliot's The Wasteland, we know we can never hope to speak it aloud satisfactorily.<endOfText>
<human>Even as the siren voices in the poem call us towards speech, we're aware that our own one voice can never hope to carry all these as we would want it to.<endOfText>
<bot>But they do call us towards speech, so that at least in the urgency and the felt inadequacy of our attempt to speak, erm to speak those words and lines, we can act out something of the quality and kind of our response, our shadowy awareness of what these incomparable and shrieking voices meant to the Eliot who was fighting for his own voice.<endOfText>
<human>Such attempts as we can make are essential.<endOfText>
<bot>Catching up, however badly, our recognition of the decisive tension between eye and ear.<endOfText>
<human>I can conceive no response, no criticism which does not include the practical recognition of that tension, but such is the nature of Joyce's last venture that I cannot, without cheating, read to you from it.<endOfText>
<bot>It is to the eye that you must turn if you are to read Finnegans Wake.<endOfText>
<human>Here in the final work, the shaping of a total unity, there returns a crucial division, and because I cannot read from it, even badly, I will not talk about it, which leaves intact your freedom to go and read it.<endOfText>
<bot>Read this proliferating, surging, skipping, mocking, smiling, looping torrent — what an enterprise it is — a man taking on human language.<endOfText>
<human>And not just some great abstract notion either, for the assault bears also on that aspect of language which embodies authority, the rules of language, those terrible received truths, which at least the older ones amongst you will remember.<endOfText>
<bot>That a preposition is a bad thing to end a sentence with, or that you can't have a sentence with out a verb.<endOfText>
<human>That certain words are less acceptable than others.<endOfText>
<bot>Above all, that the word is the irreducible, the minimum unit, itself enshrined for every in the silver columns of the dictionary.<endOfText>
<human>Division then returns, for this is a struggle to the death, or life.<endOfText>
<bot>The very notion of struggle will, of course, trigger widely varied responses among readers, quickening some, frightening others, bewildering yet others again.<endOfText>
<human>But if writing is not done in neutral ground, neither is reading.<endOfText>
<bot>Let us therefore remind ourselves of the huge distances, inner and outer, that Joyce has travelled, and take one final look at his total undertaking.<endOfText>
<human>There is a famous line by another Irishman, Yeates, a line too often thought to be transparent ‘Romantic Ireland's dead and gone’.<endOfText>
<bot>Don't you believe it.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you, Hercules.<endOfText>
<bot>I am very sure that you will agree with me, if I may borrow a phrase from Joyce, that we all hope that it's not at all unlikely that George Craig will come again to preach.<endOfText>
<human>His preaching was an outstanding success, and whatever exceptional divisions Joyce's work may continue to provoke among his readers, and whatever perhaps less exceptional divisions George Craig's lecture may create among some of the audience in respect of the substance of his arguments, and how could it not given the generous measure and richness of what he offered, there would be no division on the quality of his craftsmanship and the beguiling nature of his themes.<endOfText>
<bot>If I may speak as one who has heard all the centenary lectures and restraining myself from being invidious, I will merely say: George, it was an admirable centenary lecture, and the huge spinning top of words, despite its complexity, kept the patterns clear and sharp and arguable.<endOfText>
<human>I got some very new insights, in fact I'm going to look up to see whether Bloom's reflections on the eunuchs in the erm church were written in the same colour as some passages in Molly Bloom's soliloquy.<endOfText>
<bot>Most important of all, I think, there was an air of excitement, enthusiasm and high intellectual quality.<endOfText>
<human>What more could we ask for?<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you very much indeed.<endOfText>
<human>Hello.<endOfText>
<bot>The parents of children with dyslexia and other learning difficulties face their own set of problems.<endOfText>
<human>Today on Ideas in Action we'll discuss these problems and suggest some options open to local parents.<endOfText>
<bot>To start with I went along to visit local parent, Mrs Audrey Durrant, who told me the main problem she faces as the mother of a ten year old dyslexic boy.<endOfText>
<human>Trying to get the child to go to school.<endOfText>
<bot>There's usually some sort of scene in the morning.<endOfText>
<human>He doesn't want to get up or get dressed and get off to school.<endOfText>
<bot>There's some worry about something — either he's not going to be able to do the work, someone's going to laugh or has been laughing at him, he doesn't think the teacher's going to understand, and it's generally a terrible problem first thing in the morning to get him to get ready and get to school.<endOfText>
<human>What do you do to encourage him?<endOfText>
<bot>Try and find out what the problems are and find an answer to them, but sometimes this is extremely difficult.<endOfText>
<human>Sometimes he's so determined he's not going to go that we have to forcibly put him out of the door and get him into the car and get him there somehow.<endOfText>
<bot>As a parent, what would you like to see happen in the schools, or what sort of schooling would you best think would suit your child's needs?<endOfText>
<human>Well I don't think an ordinary school can really cope with a dyslexic child, and I don't think it's fair to expect them to do so.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean they have all the other children to teach and a dyslexic child has certain problems which need individual care and attention.<endOfText>
<human>Therefore I think it would be a better idea if units could be set up and the children could be taken out of an ordinary school for perhaps one or two or three years, according to how much time is required, where they could give the individual attention and the specialist teaching to help them to overcome this particular problem.<endOfText>
<bot>How did you first recognise that your child was dyslexic?<endOfText>
<human>Well we'd always had the problem going to school.<endOfText>
<bot>He seemed bright enough and very eager to learn, but when I went to the school to see his work I found that his handwriting was very, very bad and his spelling was absolutely atrocious, and although he was good at mathematics, as time went on he began to get very worried and very upset about it and when I looked at his work I realized that he was doing a lot of the words back to front and was getting the direction of figures mixed up.<endOfText>
<human>Reversing the numbers?<endOfText>
<bot>Reversing the numbers.<endOfText>
<human>If the answer to the sum was twenty four, he'd put forty two, and starting the sum the wrong side and getting very confused.<endOfText>
<bot>And then I began to become very worried about it and it just happened by chance that one Friday morning I heard a programme on Radio Brighton, and it was Doctor Wisbey speaking about dyslexia, and it dawned on me immediately that my son was dyslexia.<endOfText>
<human>And so I wrote in to Radio Brighton, and Doctor Wisbey very kindly saw my son and confirmed that he was, in fact, dyslexic.<endOfText>
<bot>Do children with learning difficulties have problems other than reading and writing?<endOfText>
<human>Well Mrs Durrant says yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Usually there's a co-ordination problem.<endOfText>
<human>Things like skipping were extremely difficult for him to do, playing football, running, all of those are very difficult.<endOfText>
<bot>I asked Mrs Durrant what suggestion she could offer local parents whose children have similar difficulties.<endOfText>
<human>Well I think if you think that there's something wrong, see the teacher and the headmistress immediately.<endOfText>
<bot>Ask if you can see the Educational Psychologist to discuss the problem with them, and really try and get specialist help.<endOfText>
<human>And if your child is dyslexic, reassure them that they are not the only child, there are other children who share this problem, that they in fact are not stupid, or mad — and quite often they think they are mad, they can understand what is wrong with them because they don't really understand what they're supposed to be doing.<endOfText>
<bot>There are many adults who've had to face up to this problem and have, in actual fact, overcome it  Susan Hampshire is one; I believe Hans Anderson, also, has suffered from this difficulty — that with help they can overcome this and live a normal life.<endOfText>
<human>I know you and other parents with you are working to set up a special dyslexic unit in the Brighton area.<endOfText>
<bot>How are your efforts going and what do you hope to accomplish?<endOfText>
<human>Well we very much would like to start a unit in January, but this is extremely difficult because of all the cuts in education and the education office really hasn't got the money to start a unit now.<endOfText>
<bot>We are desperately, desperately, in need of funds.<endOfText>
<human>I think it's about five thousand that we really require to establish and equip this unit.<endOfText>
<bot>We've had coffee mornings and various other sales, but they're very badly attended.<endOfText>
<human>We had one yesterday — hardly anybody came.<endOfText>
<bot>This is very disheartening and very disappointing because this is a major problem and it makes so much difference to the lives of these children.<endOfText>
<human>Some of these children, if they were given this attention over a two year period, could overcome this and go into the secondary school able to cope and take their place alongside the other children, and this is desperately important.<endOfText>
<bot>Dyslexic children have so many interests and this is very frustrating for them.<endOfText>
<human>My son, for example, loves science, he's very interested in engineering, he's interested in astronomy, he wants to find out everything he can about them.<endOfText>
<bot>We go to the library, he goes round the library, he gets books out that he wants to bring home and read, and of course when we get home he's not able to read them.<endOfText>
<human>I try and read as much as I can, but this extremely difficult when one's a mother with a family and there are other children as well to look after.<endOfText>
<bot>The worst thing for my son is that what he would like to do more than anything else in all the world is to be able to read like other people.<endOfText>
<human>Where can local parents turn for help with such problems?<endOfText>
<bot>Well one place is the East Sussex Dyslexic Association.<endOfText>
<human>Chairperson Mary Nash-Wortham states the Association's Function.<endOfText>
<bot>Our Association was formed nearly ten years ago and is aimed at helping parents to solve their children's problems through a local based scheme where they may contact a teacher who's qualified in their local area and that teacher will see the child and advise the parents whether individual tuition would help him.<endOfText>
<human>Any parent is very welcome to contact me as Chairman of the East Sussex Dyslexia Association on Eastbourne three four seven six two.<endOfText>
<bot>The address is sixty eight, Pashley Road, Eastbourne, or our local contact, who is a teacher, Mr David Pollack of thirty, Coleman Street, Brighton.<endOfText>
<human>Other options are available to parents, both inside and outside the schools, Mary Nash-Wortham reports.<endOfText>
<bot>Local parents should discuss the possibilities with the head of their child's school, and if possible get the child referred to the psychologist, who will assess the child for intelligence.<endOfText>
<human>If this method is barred because the headmaster does not agree that the child might have a learning difficulty called dyslexia, then the parents will have to go outside the school system and possibly go to the Dyslexia Institute at Staines, where a full assessment is carried out, with a report, which is sent to the parents.<endOfText>
<bot>Unfortunately this is not part of the National Health Service, and the parents will have to pay a fee.<endOfText>
<human>Miss Wortham stresses that children with learning difficulties can be helped with remedial work.<endOfText>
<bot>Certainly there are a number of children who can be helped quite easily, depending on the density of their problem.<endOfText>
<human>The older the child is the harder it is for him to overcome his difficulty, but there are courses and there are techniques available which definitely do help children to overcome their problems with reading and with spelling and with language as a whole.<endOfText>
<bot>I've been particularly interested in the clumsy child, who has co-ordination, rhythm and timing difficulties, and I have written a booklet which is now available for parents and for teachers who are interested, for the age range five years to eleven years, which gives parents exercises to carry out with their children to encourage the child in overcoming difficulties with co-ordination, rhythm, timing, and to help them with speaking, writing and reading remediation.<endOfText>
<human>What sort of remedial techniques can parents use?<endOfText>
<bot>Mrs Durrant describes her own method.<endOfText>
<human>When I started I had to right back to the very beginning and start from three letter words.<endOfText>
<bot>We did a great deal of work with music and in listening to sounds and in rhythms, and then a lot of work in which I actually read to him and he followed all the time what I was reading, so that he would try to link the sounds and the words together.<endOfText>
<human>And then we've gradually worked on building up the spelling.<endOfText>
<bot>We've worked on building up handwriting.<endOfText>
<human>Fortunately I was myself very interested in handwriting and had taught it.<endOfText>
<bot>It has entailed a great deal of study on my part.<endOfText>
<human>In fact I've scarcely been to bed before one o'clock any night since I first realized he was dyslexic.<endOfText>
<bot>Remediation works best, though, when parents and teachers co-operate, as Polytechnic Lecturer, Rod Smart, reports.<endOfText>
<human>I'm quite sure that the way forward for teachers and parents is within some kind of co-operative framework, and the only way that can work effectively is for each to be aware of other's needs and difficulties, and the kind of barriers that have existed in the past for parents to get into schools I think are being lowered by the schools, but it takes almost a generation, I think, for parents to stop being frightened about what school is doing and the kind of parents who've had bad experiences themselves in schools, I think, have enormous difficulties in approaching teachers and I'm sure the answer is in terms of co-operative activity — children and schools, schools and parents, and all of them together with myriad of outside agencies that are available for children with severe problems.<endOfText>
<bot>Local parents may also band together in support groups.<endOfText>
<human>Mary Nash-Wortham and Mrs Durrant agree that these are most important.<endOfText>
<bot>I think if parents are concerned and feel that their child is brighter than his performance shows, then it is time they took some action.<endOfText>
<human>The path is not easy for them, because they will be blocked by suggestions from the school that their child is a late developer, he's lazy, or that he doesn't like working, but this should not deter them.<endOfText>
<bot>They must take action and they must feel free to contact us, feel free to put their point of view across to the headmaster and to ask for a psychologist's report.<endOfText>
<human>And they must join with other parents who've got a similar difficulty, so that we can fight this very wide cause.<endOfText>
<bot>I think there should be a centre where the parents of dyslexic children could get together.<endOfText>
<human>It's so difficult and frustrating for parents and one feels so isolated, and one needs to discuss these problems with other parents and the parents working together, of course, could do so much in erm getting units started and getting people to understand this problem.<endOfText>
<bot>There's so many erm handicaps that children have that people can see.<endOfText>
<human>They're obvious.<endOfText>
<bot>But this can't be seen — it isn't obvious — a child can become the subject of ridicule and for a sensitive and intelligent child this can be sheer hell.<endOfText>
<human>Many thanks to Audrey Durrant, Mary Nash-Wortham and Rod Smart.<endOfText>
<bot>Again the local numbers to contact for information about learning difficulties are — Mary Nash-Wortham at Easbourne oh four seven six two, and Dave Pollock at Brighton six nine four three seven nine.<endOfText>
<human>Next week on Ideas in Action we'll discuss the emotional problems associated with learning difficulties.<endOfText>
<bot>Until then, goodbye.<endOfText>
<human>Hello.<endOfText>
<bot>When we started building the university twenty years ago we encountered a very unusual problem.<endOfText>
<human>This arose because although the site was nearly ideal for our purposes, right in the middle there stood a small cottage in which lived a retired shepherd, Amos Chatfield.<endOfText>
<bot>Because his rights as a tenant were protected and because in any case the university didn't wish to be seen turfing out an elderly man whose family had lived in the same cottage for five generations, we left him in peace and build around him, as it were, expecting him perhaps to move elsewhere or maybe to pass away.<endOfText>
<human>But now, twenty five years later, Amos is still in our midst.<endOfText>
<bot>Instead of finding students impossible to put up with, he appears to enjoy their company and they in turn appreciate him.<endOfText>
<human>He must now, by my reckoning, be nearly a hundred years old, but in no way does his enthusiasm for life appear diminished.<endOfText>
<bot>Although publicity shy, he recently and rather reluctantly agreed to be interviewed in his cottage.<endOfText>
<human>And here I apologise for the rather poor sound quality, but he refused to shut his parrot and dogs in another room during the interview.<endOfText>
<bot>Hello Mr. Chatfield, can I come in?<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes Mr Smith, the dogs won't hurt you, honest, they won't hurt you.<endOfText>
<bot>Come in and I'll make a cup of tea.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you very much.<endOfText>
<bot>Well let's have a cup of tea in a minute.<endOfText>
<human>There are just a few questions I'd like to ask you.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, don't worry about Corky the parrot.<endOfText>
<human>All right.<endOfText>
<bot>How long have you actually lived in this cottage Mr Chatfield?<endOfText>
<human>Well I've been here, it must be thirty five years.<endOfText>
<bot>And how old are you really.<endOfText>
<human>Well I've been  I really don't know.<endOfText>
<bot>I wasn't born really because I didn't have a birth certificate or anything so I don't know how old I am.<endOfText>
<human>Well you must be getting on for a hundred, because I believe you were in the Boar War, weren't you?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, that's right, Mr Smith, I was out there, oh I don't know how long it was.<endOfText>
<human>I got wounded, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>I was a Corporal and I got wounded and erm it makes me cough.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, sorry about that.<endOfText>
<bot>Mr Chatfield, you've been here for, well, as you say, thirty five years — what was it like in the old days before the university was put here?<endOfText>
<human>Well as you know I was a shepherd and I used to look after the Chichester Estate and we used to have a lot of erm  lot of erm sheep in those days.<endOfText>
<bot>I find it very difficult to breathe, but it was quite good in those days because they used to pay me well and I used to get up very early in the morning and go round with my dogs and that.<endOfText>
<human>Well you do get on very well with the students and they are very fond of you.<endOfText>
<bot>What do you attribute this to?<endOfText>
<human>Well they keep complaining about the refectory food so they come over here and have mutton stew with me from time to time, and they  I quite like their company.<endOfText>
<bot>They bring me dogs  bones for the dogs and they like talking to my parrot  I wish I could get rid of the bleeding thing though.<endOfText>
<human>Well how long have you actually had the parrot.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean life wouldn't be the same without you, of course, and without you parrot.<endOfText>
<human>Well the parrot he sort of came in the Boar War he did  he sort of flitted on my shoulder and I've been lumbered with him ever since and nobody seems to want him.<endOfText>
<bot>Well he is a rather unusual parrot, but not a very well behaved one .<endOfText>
<human>No, he's not, he cane be quite rude, can't he ?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, well, I think  we'd better leave his ruder sayings off the air at the moment.<endOfText>
<human>But you're obviously very interested in animals.<endOfText>
<bot>Now you've got what, nine or ten dogs?<endOfText>
<human>Well it's eleven actually Mr Smith.<endOfText>
<bot>I used to have three but I lost three sheep down when they built the university, and I haven't been able to find them, so I thought that they'd be useful to try and locate them, you know.<endOfText>
<human>It's very difficult, I had to pay for the sheep when the Chichester was here.<endOfText>
<bot>How do you manage to look after eleven dogs?<endOfText>
<human>We know that they are sheep dogs and very active, I mean what do they do for exercise?<endOfText>
<bot>You're joking — active?— look at them, they're all asleep.<endOfText>
<human>There's only one awake and he can't do very much, and I just don't know what to do with them.<endOfText>
<bot>They don't move for me any more and I can't whistle either.<endOfText>
<human>Well there are rumours that the dogs sometimes attack the students, or chase them.<endOfText>
<bot>Is that true?<endOfText>
<human>Oh they don't attack them, they're only playing with them.<endOfText>
<bot>They come out of lectures and then they round them up and put them in a small group, you know.<endOfText>
<human>It's quite funny to see them all in this group worried about these dogs.<endOfText>
<bot>And what do you actually attribute your long life to?<endOfText>
<human>Oh that's a difficult one.<endOfText>
<bot>I suppose erm modern living.<endOfText>
<human>As you can see, I've got gaslight and that's quite modern isn't it and what's this we're on — radio?<endOfText>
<bot>What's radio?<endOfText>
<human>Well if you  you surely have heard of radio?<endOfText>
<bot>No, not at all.<endOfText>
<human>I mean nobody tells me anything round here.<endOfText>
<bot>The students come in, but I don't know what else is around.<endOfText>
<human>Well I'll explain what radio is afterwards.<endOfText>
<bot>It would take to long to do it justice.<endOfText>
<human>Well, you know, I mean I'd like to know.<endOfText>
<bot>What's this thing stuck up my nose?<endOfText>
<human>That's called a microphone.<endOfText>
<bot>A microphone?<endOfText>
<human>Yes<endOfText>
<bot>What the hell's a microphone?<endOfText>
<human>Well I'll tell you afterwards.<endOfText>
<bot>Well I don't know what it is.<endOfText>
<human>Okay<endOfText>
<bot>here isn't it.<endOfText>
<human>Well anyway Mr Chatfield, thank you very much for allowing me to ask <endOfText>
<bot>Well don't you want to ask me any more questions?<endOfText>
<human>No, I think I've asked you quite enough, and thank you very much for talking to me.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, you know, I mean I'd like to know if I've answered them right, you know.<endOfText>
<human>You've answered them absolutely right and thank you very much.<endOfText>
<bot>Would you be quiet just for a minute.<endOfText>
<human>Well, you know, it's great to have visitors like you Mr Smith.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, thank you Mr Chatfield.<endOfText>
<human>That's all that we have time for today.<endOfText>
<bot>Next week we shall be <endOfText>
<human>Do you want a cup of tea yet?<endOfText>
<bot>Just a minute.<endOfText>
<human>Next week we shall be back in presenting our current series on disasters in our Ideas in Action programmes.<endOfText>
<bot>Until next week then, goodbye.<endOfText>
<human>Do you do this every week Mr Smith?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes we do.<endOfText>
<human>Goodbye.<endOfText>
<bot>Well I must have to try and buy a radio I think.<endOfText>
<human><endOfText>
<bot>I'm sorry that I was unable to get, well two things went wrong first of all the date of the exhibition's changed  Gaugin and his friends in Brittany, due to circumstances beyond our control.<endOfText>
<human>But in this programme you'll appreciate this planned months, its planned, when did I first contact you?, oh February wasn't it, right, so we thought we'd have pictures here and Sue would be talking in front of the pictures.<endOfText>
<bot>I didn't know at that time what the content of the exhibition was because Sarah who organised it all had to write to lots of people and arrange the loans and you know it is fairly recently that we discovered for example the tate would lend, their pictures because its very rare that they do, erm, and, so we thought the next best thing, when I discovered the change of dates would be to have slides of the pictures that Sue was using, but erm oh dear then wonderful that Sue was using a another book and this term allocated and I wasn't able to get the slides she picked, it was my fault that they're not on slide due to the amount of time that we had to do this.<endOfText>
<human>Therefore I'm afraid were going to have to pass Sue's book around , we'll leave the lights on and erm she's changed the scripture of her talks so that she will be describing the picture why'll its been passed round and could you please sort of pass it fairly quickly, I'll be at the back and then I'll come down into the front again, is there anyone who's a poet?<endOfText>
<bot>I know I enter the poem when there is one<endOfText>
<human>not every picture has its<endOfText>
<bot>some of these kinds telling you about how they write a poem, if I was going to<endOfText>
<human>Right<endOfText>
<bot>but erm, we'll, we'll spend start the whole questions again when we get to the next one<endOfText>
<human>and we do have, some of this slides which, I'll show at the very end, alright, but it means it er, erm, the first part of the talk we'll keep the lights on and then could I ask you, you know to look and then pass it around like school<endOfText>
<bot>nobody looks back and I rush<endOfText>
<human>oh yeah <endOfText>
<bot>right I'm pleased  pleased to introduce to us, er, er against all these difficulties and the nearer you are at the front the better, there's all stuff here look<endOfText>
<human>I'm sitting at the back<endOfText>
<bot>anybody at the back would like to move nearer then sit here  yes, ok, is that alright?<endOfText>
<human>Well I think I'll start off by telling you a little bit about myself erm, I'm a writer and I live in Durham, my work is here and I've also work abroad, if anybody can't hear me please say<endOfText>
<bot>No<endOfText>
<human>you can't hear me, right, ok, I'll try and speak up a little bit louder, erm my work, I work erm here and I work abroad and I live in Durham, er I'm a writer and erm one of the things that I'm most interested in is using art as an inspiration for my work as a, as a writer and I'd like to be able to show you by this talk, how I do that, erm, I have a few publications, my work's performed by a local group actually based in Newcastle and I'm a member of er a group called Another Story and my work's been put to music by a composer and er a play and the play and sing that, that the pieces of<endOfText>
<bot>erm another area of my work is  as I er writing workshops, the writing workshops are very different from the normal writing workshops there based at galleries and they take groups of people round an exhibition recording their comments on either one particular picture or the exhibition as a whole and then with my help we put the comments into poems that are then displayed along side the exhibits, erm this work I do with erm all sorts of people with children people with special needs, disabled people and, and that's really where my interest in art erm comes in and I find that its a great leveller for people who would like to express themselves and have perhaps have difficulty by aiding, by looking at paintings and being able to see perhaps emotions or images that they, they feel themselves, so in all areas erm I find painting in my areas of work, painting influences me and has done for as, as long as I can remember.<endOfText>
<human>Sometimes erm given me the questions and sometimes answering the questions for me, its always informing me and over the last few years I've erm, I said that to try and understand erm, how to use this information in my own work as, as a writer, and I see, I see parallels in all forms of art, communication is of course one, erm and the need to recognise and respond the plight of others is, is another area and the area that as a writer I'm particularly drawn too.<endOfText>
<bot>Physically and erm emotionally writing can be very isolating and so, for example a few years ago, I was writing a huge piece on Africa about Africa and I found emotions growing that I actually didn't have names for, erm and it made it impossible to finish the piece I was working on, and then I, I went to see an Afro Asian exhibition of art and I saw portraying some of these paintings the same emotions and it, it didn't give me a name for the emotions but it, it made me feel an awful lot less isolated seeing that erm other people have also, have also felt this.<endOfText>
<human>So I was going to rummage through these slides and we don't have them, erm so I'll have to, I'll hand the, the, the book around in just one minute, erm the poems that I'm going to read to you, very few of them are actually complete, most of them are sketches erm ideas and images of erm, that I've got, I've, I've got them from the paintings.<endOfText>
<bot>Sometimes when I, I write a poem I want to create a particular mood erm giving the piece erm a shape, a, a definite shape or just a shadowy shape erm and the overcoat in er Bon Jour Monsieur Gaugin, I found very, very expressive and the starting point for, for this particular poem I'll hand this round to you know, with the name of the, the front, right  I don't, has anybody, if you already know this picture, does anybody actually know it already?, no  I start with the overcoat obviously erm very expressive, not just because it was, people wear over , overcoats in cold days, but it was the size of the coat and the shape of it and, and it gave me a weight, I felt, er I felt a very definite mood erm about this picture because of the coat and it was a, er a ejective mood that I, that I felt from that, and the stick in the erm hands of the women over the bridge gave me the sound for, for this poem  would you like me to read as the, the thing being passed around, would that be ok?<endOfText>
<human>Yes<endOfText>
<bot>ok, this poem's called erm A Pause In A Moment  Worn out days dressed in damp wheat, heavy coat pulling at tired shoulders, memory pushed back, brought forward in the click of a stick, pause in a moment, sunset reflected in eyes offering the warmth of recognition , so that poem started with the overcoat and that was the mood as I say, that was the mood of rejection erm and there was something about the way the old girl was looking at the women on the bridge, almost as if there was this recognition and, as it brought back memories that perhaps went or as black as the overcoat, erm the next er painting which I'm going to read to you about is erm  have you<endOfText>
<human>its the Four Brettan Girls and does it, do any of you know, I'm sure most of you, some of you have heard that<endOfText>
<bot>erm  when I was looking at this, this picture of the, of the Brettan Girls, I erm, I was really particularly struck by the bo , the mild head of one of the dancers and the fact that she was rubbing her, her heal, erm and it gave me a voice for, for this poem, I was also drawn by the dismissal, there's a goose in the painting, there's four, four geese and one of them is dismissing the, the, the winner outright and erm I found his look very, very interesting and, and I couldn't help but compare the lies of these four dancers with those within erm from the later period as the eye that, that, that Gaugin painted later on.<endOfText>
<human>This, this poem's called Dancing Feet  Time found hidden in a hard day, dry earth becomes a dance floor, audience of three fowl, the fourth along with a reaper turns it back, wooden shoes meant for mud, rug on dancing feet   erm and, if you, if you take, were oops trying to pay particular attention to, if you can see the geese in, in this one here, there's a fate, there's a, there's a forfeit which is missing, what's going on and er, and the reason well in fact er which, which was er very much a vocal point for me in, in that painting <endOfText>
<bot>I think its got to be better if I hold it different.<endOfText>
<human>It is, but then you won't be able to compare the, the details against the<endOfText>
<bot>Well could you, we pass it round twice?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, yes, you could pass it round twice, that's ok with everybody<endOfText>
<bot>Yes<endOfText>
<human>Erm, how shall we do that?, as its going, read it again now?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes<endOfText>
<human>Ok,Time found hidden in a hard day, dry earth becomes a dance floor, audience of three fowl, the fourth along with a reaper turns it back, wooden shoes meant for mud, rug on dancing feet   Erm the next one is the still life on, on with three puppies, while I was looking at Gaugin's work I couldn't help but notice he's constantly struck by the fact that he use set of three symbols through out his work it seems, and very, very often three caricatures erm or lines of three or three objects and I found this very interesting, more point of view that something that I, I wanted to incorporate in my own work, but I wanted to find a line or a phrase to use in the same way, erm, all of my work starts as one or a series of visual images and, and I then turn them into characters, repeating a word or repeating a line would be a way of erm emphasising characterise erm and the puppies that are in this painting erm, they delighted my children so much, I don't know if any of you know, do you know the painting of the three puppies<endOfText>
<bot>its going to come round  at you in a minute, so I'll talk about it until it gets to you, erm, it delighted my children this particular painting, erm and I decided to put my sort of analytical approach to one side erm and do something with that later, so this poem is from my, my children's point of view and one of the things that are very interested, they were really worried, that, erm, I think it marks the height of the table and the fact that the puppies might fall off and do themselves some harm, that, I'll read it while its going round and then I can see then, that, so this is, ok, from my children's point of view this poem, its called Threes,Table laid and waiting, milk place in bowl not to high, they lap and swirl, played and roll, paws distance from knocking and breaking goblet, made from clay .<endOfText>
<human>There's something else the children were convinced that the goblets weren't actually clay, the goblets that were on the erm, the table as opposed to <endOfText>
<bot>would you like me to read that poem again?, would that be helpful?, right, we were<endOfText>
<human>with the, of the erm, the picture, Threes,Table laid and waiting, milk place in bowl not to high, they lap and swirl, played and roll, paws distance from knocking and breaking goblet, made from clay .<endOfText>
<bot>The next one is erm Van Gogh's sun flowers, that's it, that one, its erm, well its Gaugin, Van Gogh's sun flowers<endOfText>
<human>ok, I'll talk as its going round again, if that's alright with<endOfText>
<bot>is that alright?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, putting images into words is not always easy, a colour in a painting can give you a way in and the brown of Van Gogh's jacket erm affected me with this one particularly and the sun flower I felt was inappropriate misplace, in a vase to, to small, erm  and it gave me an image a very strong image of suffering and this poem is in its very early stages and its literally just a list of images and I wanted to be able to show you how I start off which is with a series of images and then I have to put some filler in and open them up a bit and, and make them more accessible and understandable, but this is just a list form.<endOfText>
<bot>Sun flower limping, water less vase, suffering eyes, desperados in caged , so from, from that painting I had a tremendous feel of something undergoing tremendous suffering and seem very desperate about the situation, and I didn't just see that in, in the picture of Van Gogh, but I could see that in the sun flower, so as, as a writer its images like that, that I would look for and open up and turn into characters or a way of portraying a particular mood, erm, the next one , were doing very well <endOfText>
<human>Its exhausting.<endOfText>
<bot>I suppose this is erm, a caricature, a self portrait  this little, I, in fact I was, really actually hilarious as I felt that, I, I, don't actually know an awful lot about Gaugin, but if, if I knew nothing about him at all, I would of thought he was having a bit of joke of himself with this, but er, being the person that he was I can't image that he had that quality, that, I don't believe he would be laughing at himself, erm, erm, the symbolism erm and conflict of this painting its dazzles me more than, than the colour or at least as much as the colours in it, but there's a, there's a half eaten, well it isn't half eaten, but there's half an apple at the top and, and that was the, the way into me finally, for, for writing about this, this again is a shopping list, I call it a shopping list, this is just visual images that, that will be opened out at some point and turn it into something, and my images were erm  Shoulders of the matador smoking snakes, dare to bit an apple, see one half gone and still I wear a halo intact , that I'm sure I've completely wrong about him as a, a person, but as the painting that's obviously something else, erm, I found that one of the things that were he's, I, I think probably that everybody who writes is that you'll come to a point when you can't write, you stop writing, you haven't got anything you want to write about, or your frightened of writing, and I devise exercises so that , that doesn't happened to me, I think writing is like any skill you have to keep doing it to be able to do it, its, you, some of it is a game and the rest of it is hard work, and one of the exercises I, I delighted using erm a portrait of a woman erm, its about erm the er still life, its the back one, yes this one here, I have, I, I hope to use this as a writing exercise I found the, the maths in this and the colour of the piece of fruit in the background, very interesting because most of the colours to me seem a, a lot less vibrant then many of his other paintings, and so they, they attracted me and have a, a strong sense of erm, er a hidden desire in that and so it, to use it as a writing exercise which I intend doing, it will be able about a situation of character's with erm something that's hidden, some desire, I don't, the, not even spoke about to themselves or, or generally, erm I like to sort of say that came from those two little, just this amounts of colour which seemed to be saying such a lot <endOfText>
<human>anything I do<endOfText>
<bot>if, erm while this is going round you have any questions, now would be, now would be a good time to ask them if you have any, there will be time at the end to talk, you can do<endOfText>
<human>Have you check to see if your<endOfText>
<bot>well erm, sort of in that erm, I was asked to come and do this talk, and so I, I organise to make sure that I had access to some of Gaugin's work and then to write poems about it, erm, so, erm, only in as much as that it was a waiting to hear this talk, but a lot of my work is through commissions and so I find myself writing about things that I perhaps don't have any interest in particularly, erm, or I find actually in a waiting, asked to write about anything is quite er exciting and actually using my skill I think it should be, as a writer I should really be able to write about everything.<endOfText>
<human>One of the things I was asked to write about this week I think was a radio, to, to write about er what I felt about radios, you know, er, erm, so anything could be thrown at you, and obviously I have my areas that I particularly interested in and I think sometimes I get a bit complacement and I'm writing about a, I find particularly interested in and a bit lazy, so its quite good to be stretched.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, the next one, we'll shall go erm, go to market will do, yes that's right, no<endOfText>
<human>No<endOfText>
<bot>you've got the wrong one<endOfText>
<human>, I was gonna say this is definitely not going to market <endOfText>
<bot>Yes, no, she's not going to market <endOfText>
<human>This one, are you sure your not going to market<endOfText>
<bot>This one, I, I, this is one of my favourites, I love this painting.<endOfText>
<human>The movement of this reminds me of er stage set and the figures on the bench could almost be actors and actresses and with the figure at the bottom here, the male at the bottom, well its not quite at bottom, tucked away at the side there, he, he, he looks like erm, like a harlequin figure, maybe a mischief maker, er I, I felt there was a lot of fun in this painting and a lot of erm, er gravado and, and stage specs, that kind of thing, so this poem is called for obvious reasons People Of The Nile, and I'll read it twice, probably be the best way  Ancient people drawn on a vase, tell a tale, warn a friend, man dressed in red holds back a curtain, over hears and tells, they are gossiping people, playing Chinese whispers , so I, I, I quite wanted to give that er a, a contemporary updated feel, erm, I read that again for the people who may of just seen the picture at the back People Of The Nile,Ancient people drawn on a vase, tell a tale, warn a friend, man dressed in red holds back a curtain, over hears and tells, they are gossiping people, playing chinese whispers , erm, the next one , we'll have to put you on wheels I think <endOfText>
<bot>Your<endOfText>
<human>this is erm, this is a bit like I went to an auction at erm Chesteny Street, and all the exhibits were brought out by hand, by, by the<endOfText>
<bot>erm<endOfText>
<human>keeps watch, I'm sure this is a, this side of<endOfText>
<bot>I in fact I've just been shown a different copy of this, Gwen has just shown me a different copy and the colour's is totally different, its a very, very poor erm print and, when I was looking at this through my book, the background was very strange and I felt that almost had been painted by a totally different artist, but having seen Gwin's, er Gwen's<endOfText>
<human>is much more of a go down in colour, erm so I think probably if I'd seen her, er prints I maybe I would of approached this erm differently, erm it gave me a very immense voice about crowds, erm, very, very different from the front of the picture apart from the alarm registered in the eyes of the, of the old woman erm, this is called Even Paradise Has Its End, sorry Even Paradise Has Its Price, sorry  Ours in the night laying between sleep and arousal held in balance, fragile as dust on a scale, night spirit's sit easy, in no hurry, even paradise has its price , would you like me to read that one again?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>As I say all these poem's are very dense and erm if I get round to, to completing them they'll probably have at least another verse, certainly extra words and rhymes, that open it out and make it a bit more plausible   Ours in the night , no I've got it wrong, sorry, I've moved on and I shouldn't've done <endOfText>
<bot>That's it<endOfText>
<human>This is right,Ours in the night laying between sleep and arousal held in balance, fragile as dust on a scale, night spirits sit easy, in no hurry, even paradise has its price .<endOfText>
<bot>The next one is not working, this one here erm the light framed split here<endOfText>
<human>erm falling on the ground is the curse of the, of the male's aunt<endOfText>
<bot>People and animals portray in this, in the Tahiti painting, never seemed to be in a hurry, erm, even when always relaxed even when working and I wondered how much of this was cultural and erm, how much was due to the large amounts of erm drugs consumed in most paintings at this, this period but that I suppose I'll, I'll never know for sure about, erm with this painting I found in the background, er there's a figure, that's looking in on the situation and I, I for myself think's its probably Gaugin, as he portrays himself as Christ, which I think he did quite a lot to me in, in, in a few of his paintings and so this painting gave me tremendous sense of being looked in on and this figure in the background, was the person that was doing the looking in.<endOfText>
<human>This is called It Was Good   In the afternoon when the sun half close his eyes, ants can be found not working, dogs in their cool places, vandal wall slice through heat, hold and let go of light in rays, in the afternoon when smoke curls like the back of a cat, people lean and braid hair, someone dressed like Christ looked in and said it was good .<endOfText>
<bot>Would you like that one again ,In the afternoon when the sun half close his eyes, ants can be found not working, dogs in their cool places, vandal wall slice through heat, hold and let go of light in rays, in the afternoon when smoke curls like the back of a cat, people lean and braid hair, someone dressed like Christ looked in and said it was good   now we have the dug out  how food is presented erm can say so much, at least it does to me and, so that, so that the beginning of this poem became from er the food, piece of food held in the hand of the mayor in this picture.<endOfText>
<human>Paintings erm have the power to take you back in time, I can look at a painting and remember something that's happened yesterday or years and years ago and as a small child, looking at this painting I remembered as a small child seeing for the first time erm the sea dipping into er, sorry the sun dipping into, into the sea and being horrified I was convinced that the heat of the sun would boil the oceans and the world dry and it reminded me for an awful lot of my childhood and I'm sure if I'd seen this painting years ago it would of persuaded me otherwise, erm  this is called In A Days Work  Satisfaction in a days work, chosen not given, eating the laxed food, face turned to steer a sun, making cloth into a gown and giving colour to the side of a boat <endOfText>
<bot>What is it called again?<endOfText>
<human>In A Days Work,Satisfaction in a days work, chosen not given, eating the laxed food, face turned to steer a sun, making cloth into a gown and giving colour to the side of a boat   erm we know come to a<endOfText>
<bot>here comes the last er picture in my, in my talk<endOfText>
<human>this is erm, this is going to be exhibited here on the twenty third of July, ok, erm, two, two of Gaugin's pictures, this is one of them, and several other artists er of the same period, and I think this is going to be the only venue in, in England, I don't think there coming, sort of worth seeing, but unfortunately I shall miss it cos I'm, I won't be here, erm  this is a poster of<endOfText>
<bot>I find this very difficult to erm, to relate, to relate hard work to the women portraying in, in this, we've got the postcard of that one, erm it must of been hard work and very tedious, but I think every now and then the moment breaks away and shines through at the back, and I think people like, like Gaugin erm captures those moments and then releases them on the canvass, and I hope that erm by, I hope I've been able to show you how I use art as a voice erm and a friend as my own work, even though we've maybe had to do such a sort of hand fist way, hand fisted way, erm, but, I, I've recently started to re-visit old favourite of paintings and I found that the story they tell sometimes has changed dramatically, maybe sometimes when your very little that, that, you know, sometimes dramatically as well, erm, but I, mostly, most importantly its, its still, I still find them, all of them compelling and challenging and, and something to stride for in my own work, erm, er only time will tell so I'll finish with the, the last poem which is erm comes from the postcard what's going round which is harvest, its called Patterns In The Grass,Wheat cut and falls, making lion head patterns in the grass, sickle shaped women bend and bow as a naive dressed as a dog steals the evening meal .<endOfText>
<human>I'll read that again  Wheat cut and falls, making lion head patterns in the grass, sickle shaped women bend and bow as a naive dressed as a dog steals the evening meal .<endOfText>
<bot>thank you very much for being so<endOfText>
<human>its been very difficult for everybody and I do hope you've managed to, you get something out of, out of this talk, if you have any questions I'll be very happy to, try and answer them.<endOfText>
<bot>I'd also like to er I attend, I've got a performance tomorrow night in Durham so if any of you want to come to that it would be very nice to see you , erm, if there are any questions please feel free to ask.<endOfText>
<human>Have you done many<endOfText>
<bot>No I, its not my speciality, I have tried and I, I really can't, I can't cope with the discipline of it at all, it, it er ruins the activity that I have, I know some people, one, one woman I was on the course with, it wasn't you was it Phillip?, it was somebody, was it you who worked, no<endOfText>
<human>somebody else that er we were doing a course with who had a tremendous skill with high<endOfText>
<bot>and said so much into the<endOfText>
<human>there's some woman I admire, but I can't think what her <endOfText>
<bot>Is<endOfText>
<human>seem to focus in or, or<endOfText>
<bot>in art, and you go for art by visual means, rather than say a piece of music and subject.<endOfText>
<human>I don't know, do you write<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, yes I do, both, my, my husband is a composer and a musician and erm just recently you, well I'll show you, basically that, we exchanged skills and erm I<endOfText>
<human>interpretations of his music erm, I, one of the things I would love to do and I'm hoping to do next year is to do something related to art using a dance<endOfText>
<bot>and words, I think with three mix, mix well actually, mix it with<endOfText>
<human>its exciting, but that's one thing I really would like to work with<endOfText>
<bot>I was asking you cos I'm always having arguments with the<endOfText>
<human>I, I, myself, I can see it as well <endOfText>
<bot>Yes<endOfText>
<human>and I think its<endOfText>
<bot>I was just wondering what you<endOfText>
<human>very much the same<endOfText>
<bot>its, the page is so important, yeah, very important <endOfText>
<human>and this is what I think myself, but lots of people<endOfText>
<bot>yes, yes that's right yes, yes<endOfText>
<human>but I mean it depends also I suppose erm, when your aiming for is the market, and I, I, I would like to have my work published but I also like to perform it and its got to be attractive to be looked at, in the first instance in, on a page its not known, er, there is, there is a lot of debate at the moment about using erm pages for poetry and some poets have actually starting using, writing from the wrong side and, and, and, and writing in the shape of a poem, for instance, if, what poem I was thinking off was a, was a waterfall so it was cascading the words cascading, you almost have to pick,ha ,ha , have a choice of, of words that you want to fit into a particular thing, erm I think that's had its place, but I think it can be a bit off putting as well, yeah, but it exciting, yeah definitely.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you try any other<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes varied, and there interesting, with, with children, particularly if they erm if I'm doing workshops er with art and writing workshops and we come across an abstract picture, the children music, and,we , as a way into their vocabulary which isn't as large as their, their writing skills, and there'll, there'll decipher an abstract picture, wonderful language and I like doing that you know<endOfText>
<bot>I'm thinking the<endOfText>
<human>abstract art<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, yes<endOfText>
<human>express<endOfText>
<bot>yes, oh yes, and erm, going back to somebody asked me earlier, erm, about how it, I feel I have to be able to write about, just about anything, erm, and so if I was given commission to write about any one thing I would have to put myself in a position to, to be able to do it.<endOfText>
<human>I think this idea of, of writers shutting themselves away and writing has gone, you know, very<endOfText>
<bot>that is a luxury I think erm to be able to do it, if you want to write and earn money, which I do as well as, as socialize while I'm working erm you've got to find ways of, of, of doing that and erm just writing books and poetry just wouldn't, I, I, I couldn't survive on that, I really do have to find other ways of, of earning money which is enjoying more and also uses of my skill and erm  I would think you'd need to be in contact with the situation rather than you not knowing, being able to write about that.<endOfText>
<human>Do you say whether you, identify the picture only on<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, that was very<endOfText>
<human>er, er, I mean that,<endOfText>
<bot>yes<endOfText>
<human>then they confront both of the<endOfText>
<bot>the visual image and the written words<endOfText>
<human>I'm sorry what<endOfText>
<bot>Do you identify the artist, do you<endOfText>
<human>Oh I see, yes, yes, I, huh, yes I would do, I, I, I would say in quite definitely that these words are inspired by such a such artist and, make it quite clear that I'm a writer and not a, I, I, I don't study art or I just don't understand science and painting and, and its my responses to that, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Just seems that it, it to me must be wrong, that it didn't identify them because a particular picture anyway, the reason why I find difficulty in making <endOfText>
<human>Absolutely, yes <endOfText>
<bot>way for them<endOfText>
<human>the, this, this is just one aspect of, of my writing and I write about all sorts of things and erm, erm the shows that I do, we use two artists that's erm, I, I've written erm two, two poems about erm, er Darren  and, and erm Stanley er you you've heard <endOfText>
<bot>and erm, and I have assumed wrongly that most people will know the work of their<endOfText>
<human>and luckily that the, the song that we did was funny and so people enjoyed it, but they didn't understand it and they didn't have a visual image of the artist's work, so I now have to take erm a couple of pictures, er prints with me if ever were going to read it and we sing those songs but not everybody does, and then they do become excessible you know, they can see, you know, that erm, yes erm if it, if I was going to publish a book of poem I, it would have to be stated that this related to this picture and presumably it'd have to be, it would be with it, with it<endOfText>
<bot>if anybody would be interested in doing.<endOfText>
<human>Does when you've finished the poem you read it out?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes<endOfText>
<human>That's right, yes .<endOfText>
<bot>That's right, yes it should, erm, these, these aren't completed, but even so the ones that we, we, I have done that too I've opened out, having performed them, you still need to have a little bit of an idea<endOfText>
<human>That's right<endOfText>
<bot>of the artist<endOfText>
<human>yeah<endOfText>
<bot>but as a, as a piece of work in it, yes that's right yes and I hope we, we did achieve that<endOfText>
<human>Yes<endOfText>
<bot>erm because they enjoyed the, there are a few funny lines in it you know and they enjoy the, the visual amatory of these people performing it, but to themselves to actually understand it they need to know which artist it was, yeah<endOfText>
<human>and you know<endOfText>
<bot>yeah, that's right<endOfText>
<human>yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you think colours with emotions are<endOfText>
<human>Oh very much so, yes new devotion, size, erm, it, it in one or two of these erm they gave me a definite feel and to a, to a, it new I was trying to write<endOfText>
<bot>I think Von Gogh was<endOfText>
<human>well yes absolutely yeah, and, and shapes I feel as well, you, you,<endOfText>
<bot>particularly erm, and one of things that I did find in Gaugin's painting of Von Gogh was that erm, er, erm, depression really, I, I could see it there and the des desolation very much as if he was looking in on somebody who was in that position er, although at the time I don't thing Gaugin and, er Von Gogh himself knew it<endOfText>
<human>No<endOfText>
<bot>I, I don't, I'm not an expert for poet, I, I, I feel about it, perhaps didn't <endOfText>
<human>Did you hope to show the slides that you've got?,<endOfText>
<bot>I mean is <endOfText>
<human>Yes, would you like to see, there's about three<endOfText>
<bot>.<endOfText>
<human>You need the lights off?<endOfText>
<bot>Where's the light switch?, erm<endOfText>
<human>Do you not fear that if you, if there is<endOfText>
<bot>and another, especially if your contracted with powerful paintings, that the approach you make suffer as the result of the artist's vision, or<endOfText>
<human>I think that we can<endOfText>
<bot>and see each other and also my interpretation<endOfText>
<human>yes<endOfText>
<bot>would be different from the reputation of, of the<endOfText>
<human>as I was holding on a particular images and create and then become those energy<endOfText>
<bot>right<endOfText>
<human>rather than doing it direct, erm conscription of the painting<endOfText>
<bot>right<endOfText>
<human>its my responses to it, that would be a very different approach, because of familiar with a, I mean with the postcard that was past around, familiar with that picture then looked at it one, I feel that about it.<endOfText>
<bot>When your reading<endOfText>
<human>I closed my eyes and I got a different feeling<endOfText>
<bot>Yes<endOfText>
<human>from your<endOfText>
<bot>and I can visualise, something totally different<endOfText>
<human>But is that what it should be?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, that's what, yes that's what I hoped for because I, I feel everybody's interpretation<endOfText>
<human>yes<endOfText>
<bot>is different, and you need an original<endOfText>
<human>yes<endOfText>
<bot>and you maybe miss something, from this you have your own, that's right and its somebody else teaches you another angle then there's possibility for ex ,ex , expanding possibility <endOfText>
<human>yes <endOfText>
<bot>which I find exciting, but, but interesting in it.<endOfText>
<human>You seemed to take it<endOfText>
<bot>with your poems<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I, I do<endOfText>
<bot>and<endOfText>
<human>I think I went down to most people to say they can't, but when you point out something to them, they say yes I can see that, look there's this as well and I think culturally er were led to believe if you don't succeed in it, erm but in actual fact I think that you all do, but perhaps I think the books do, either assess it and give it value or, or still allow it to happen<endOfText>
<bot>Mm, somebody<endOfText>
<human>I feel it did, I strongly feel it, feel that, but I'm also sure that its an awful lot easier than, than most people think , but its not going to work for us is it?<endOfText>
<bot>Its a shame we didn't have the slides, I think we'd see more<endOfText>
<human>Have you got the<endOfText>
<bot>If you'd like to hold a torch for me  I can <endOfText>
<human>its erm, I think Sue<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, ok I'll just, I can, I can do it winding up<endOfText>
<human>So this is called A Pause In A Moment  Worn out days, dressed in damp weeds, petticoat cling and tired shoulders, memory pushed back, brought forward in the click of the stick, pause in a moment, sunset reflected in eyes offering the warmth or recognition   Threes  Table laid and waiting, milk place in bowl not to high, they lap and swirl, played and roll, paws distance from knocking and breaking goblets, made from clay .<endOfText>
<bot>Can I just point out that something here, erm, was, I think I mentioned about my children it was the height of the table and its just so little that, that they indicate their in height in this picture, but it is there and, erm, that, I found that really very exciting and as I say the, The Threes, it, the three goblets, the three apples the three puppies, so often I've, I've found that there is three sets of, three objects and in<endOfText>
<human>I haven't actually got a, a poem for this, I was saying to you that I would use this, I intend using this as a writing exercise, because the, the colour of her mouth and the colour of the piece of boot in the background, just stands out to me, it says, its about to me hidden desire of some sort, either the artist's or hers or  mine  I don't know  <endOfText>
<bot>So, none of those pictures would be in the exhibition that you have?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>But this is our picture which<endOfText>
<human>This is erm, yes I don't have a, I don't have<endOfText>
<bot>I have got a poem for this, which we were, its been<endOfText>
<human>to Pam  now that would be interesting<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you very much you fascinate, battling against others.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you very much.<endOfText>
<bot><endOfText>
<human>I've come of a new  <endOfText>
<bot>please.<endOfText>
<human>Let's have a look.<endOfText>
<bot>This is the Noraday yeah .<endOfText>
<human>Noraday yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Everything okay on that?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, fine yeah .<endOfText>
<bot>Periods behaving?<endOfText>

<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I used to on er<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>other pill.<endOfText>
<bot>yeah that's right.<endOfText>
<human>But sometimes I don't have one or <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>sometimes it's just one <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>day.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, a bit erratic ?<endOfText>
<human>Er Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But <endOfText>
<human>Right, okay.<endOfText>
<bot>no problem at all.<endOfText>
<human>Yes , that can happen on Noraday Waterworks?<endOfText>
<bot>Bowels?<endOfText>
<human>Breasts?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah fine.<endOfText>
<human>All behaving?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Right, now what we do need to do today is to get your blood pressure checked.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>How are things going on from the other point of view?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm it get's<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>a bit off still .<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>we h we still haven't heard anything.<endOfText>
<bot>From the psychologist?<endOfText>
<human>Er no,go to see him .<endOfText>
<bot>you've you've got from them, certainly.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>But you're still in limbo as far as the <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>the civil action is concerned?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm even no second inquest, nothing .<endOfText>
<human>Oh.<endOfText>
<bot>But er apparently  got a solicitor.<endOfText>
<human>Er we haven't had to see anybody about that and he sent us a letter saying that he'd like to see us and we went and he says it there might not be a second inquest.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>Might go straight to court.<endOfText>
<bot>Ah.<endOfText>
<human>And then we had a phone call from the police, about a month ago.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh right, good.<endOfText>
<human>Saying that it had gone straight to court, it was in court, you know,<endOfText>
<bot>Oh right.<endOfText>
<human>but we haven't heard anything.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh well I mean they may have been adjourned or a<endOfText>
<human>Even though <endOfText>
<bot>it may have been referred to a higher court.<endOfText>
<human>You think so.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm<endOfText>
<human>I mean we we haven't heard anything directly, I'm only glad that the police are actually telling you something.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah yeah.<endOfText>
<human>It it was a big shock that day, when we had that phone call <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>But it was I You know, to know that you haven't got to fight,<endOfText>
<bot>That's right, yeah .<endOfText>
<human>T to take him to court.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm<endOfText>
<human>But it's a long process.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean we have dealings with solicitors for all sorts of things, asking for reports and we send a lot of notes away to have a lot of er  medical opinion reports and they take ages to come back.<endOfText>
<human>And that's a These are the preliminary things that the solicitor must go through before they get near court, so<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>the people <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>who it's actually They're actually dealing with are waiting months and months and months and er <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>it looks like that in your case.<endOfText>
<bot>We <endOfText>
<human>we may well have to provide the medical report on your behalf, yet.<endOfText>
<bot>God.<endOfText>
<human>But n no-one has approached me to do so.<endOfText>
<bot>No no.<endOfText>
<human>So er But it wouldn't surprise me if some sort of medical report on how you are doesn't reach court.<endOfText>
<bot>It erm Mr  who we see Psychologist erm The first week I went to see him, Oh .<endOfText>
<human>It t d certainly, you know erm<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>It's very <endOfText>
<bot>Erm <endOfText>
<human>hard.<endOfText>
<bot>We Do you know when we start doing something, we'll do it and even if we do things different  gonna say?<endOfText>
<human>We thinking well why are we doing it this way ?<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>So er everything's pulling at us,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>you know.<endOfText>
<bot>W we seem as though we do something and we  W we are absolutely drained ,<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>you get We want to push ourselves.<endOfText>
<human>That's right.<endOfText>
<bot>But do you know, once we start doing something w we're just drained all the while.<endOfText>
<human>In some ways you're in limbo cos you've you've got nothing to aim towards.<endOfText>
<bot>You've <endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>got I mean if Even if you had a date to aim towards, even if it was six months hence, at least that would help you, you could <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>aim towards it and work towards it.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But er and I think it's most unfair on you two really and the whole thing.<endOfText>
<human>And you you come off worse than anyone else and er but there's no real way of speeding that up, they can't give <endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>dates and they can't say what's going to happens  they have to go through, sift the evidence, arrange it all in a certain order,<endOfText>
<bot>and then go and<endOfText>
<human>Rachael, she's coming home Well she was she was discharged Friday from hospital .<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Oh right.<endOfText>
<bot>And er they thought Thursday they'd have to do an operation on her by taking a piece of bone from her hip,<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>and putting it in the leg.<endOfText>
<human>But they said it was knitting together lovely.<endOfText>
<bot>Good good.<endOfText>
<human>But then they took the pins out,<endOfText>
<bot>Ah.<endOfText>
<human>let her go home Friday, discharged her the day after.<endOfText>
<bot>She'd put too much weight on it, and she's back in hospital, she's broke it.<endOfText>
<human>Well they'll probably have to put at least the bone in there, it's a bone graft.<endOfText>
<bot>They've put it in plaster at the moment .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah,<endOfText>
<bot>But s you know she she's mending, it's erm<endOfText>
<human>She she's coming okay, I think<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>You know to see her as well, that's som you know<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>But we don't go as often now.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Erm,<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Lovely, and <endOfText>
<bot>Th The six packets of Noraday <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Your smear is due in December.<endOfText>
<human>Now I'm going to leave that with you.<endOfText>
<bot>If you really don't feel like coming up for a smear at that time, that's fine and we'll understand why.<endOfText>
<human>And w There's an awful lot <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>of pressure on you from an awful lot of other sources, so don't worry about it.<endOfText>
<bot>And<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But er you are <endOfText>
<human>actually officially due in December and obviously we'd like <endOfText>
<bot>Is that me three years?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>We'd like <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>to get that done.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Don't seem like three years.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, no I'm sure.<endOfText>
<human>The psychologist of course will continue to see you.<endOfText>
<bot>And if <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>you want to pop in and have a chat with me in between that's fine, but I'm not here next week.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So that's that.<endOfText>
<human>Er and I hope everything goes a smoothly as possible.<endOfText>
<bot>If there are any medical reports to do, we'll get them done as soon as possible but you know,a is that's very much out of our hands, and <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>we can only wait on your solicitors, their solicitors, there's the police, the court, the entire system.<endOfText>
<human>You see we haven't notified any solicitor at all, it was <endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>just when we got back off holiday we'd got a letter from <endOfText>
<bot>Well it's If the police are doing the prosecuting then you may <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>not have to bother <endOfText>
<human>Well it it Apparently there is a clause in Lee's insurance er that got the solicitor,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>and he notified us <endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>and he said he would b represent.<endOfText>
<bot>But then he mentioned, when we wen to see him, he says  we will deal with this but you must get somebody for civil <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>action.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>And we asked him if he did civil action .<endOfText>
<human>Oh right , yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>And he said yes he'd <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>he would You know he hasn't g The records haven't got to be released then to <endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>anybody else.<endOfText>
<human>he he will be able to get them.<endOfText>
<bot>But it's just hoping that everything goes right, but at least we <endOfText>
<human>haven't got to fight for prosecution.<endOfText>
<bot>No no.<endOfText>
<human>That should go through, but er it's a question of when it's going to be though.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Do they usually take time like this?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Things from er data whenever can take ages and ages and ages to And you know doctors get sued every now and again, perish the thought,<endOfText>
<bot>Oh  <endOfText>
<human>Perish the thought but when<endOfText>
<bot>y w you when you keep hearing reports in the medical journals about doctors being sued, and it can be several years after the event that the case comes to court.<endOfText>
<human>Now it won't be that long in your case, but it just goes to show how lengthy the whole thing can be .<endOfText>
<bot>Yea yeah yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And it's er<endOfText>
<bot>But it's so <endOfText>
<human>But <endOfText>
<bot>much hurt, you know .<endOfText>
<human>That's right.<endOfText>
<bot>but Pete he he still getting up very early, he doesn't sleep <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>very good .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I mean in some ways <endOfText>
<bot>And <endOfText>
<human>I think he's more effected by it than you.<endOfText>
<bot>And <endOfText>
<human>I Like erm Psychologist said erm<endOfText>
<bot>there's a lot of anger there isn't there?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>He says I'm still with denial,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>and Pete knows it's happened.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>I erm If i try not to give way, it leaves so much up here<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>I can keep thinking it's not happened.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>But <endOfText>
<bot>You know.<endOfText>
<human>But <endOfText>
<bot>wor working through it all, it's very very painful.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>And it's easier in the short term not to have  In the long term you get more problems.<endOfText>
<human>Yea yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I I've found that.<endOfText>
<human>You know, like I say, I try to do some things different, and then that don't work sometimes cos I think well why am I doing 'em like that.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I wouldn't be doing this if it hadn't happened.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you do you<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you now what I mean?<endOfText>
<human>So like you say it can cause  <endOfText>
<bot>that few more problems.<endOfText>
<human>But erm probably if we wasn't  so much and<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I think he 'd be  <endOfText>
<bot>I think sometimes he's still being protective.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>He's still being protective .<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>And erm Dunno.<endOfText>
<bot>The police i know, went to see Rachael, and they still can't understand why he didn't use an islander, you know?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>And it's just unbelievable.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>But everybody's allowed a mistake but<endOfText>
<human>when you've got a big articulated lorry ,<endOfText>
<bot>Bit of drastic mistake to make.<endOfText>
<human>You know if you You know I can't stop feeling as though that morning he used that lorry as a weapon.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>You know.<endOfText>
<bot>Er I don't  I think as it goes on y you do start and get that anger that anger so bad, but erm But I'll leave you to get on Doctor.<endOfText>
<human>And  <endOfText>
<bot><endOfText>
<human>Good afternoon, and welcome to On The Record.<endOfText>
<bot>Another seven people murdered in Northern Ireland, a dreadful end to a dreadful week, and yet on Friday there had been at least a little optimism in the air, John Major and Albert Reynolds getting together in Brussels for what were billed as substantive talks, where does all that go now?<endOfText>
<human>I'll be talking to John Hume, the leader of the S D L P, according to Mr Major his talks with Gerry Addams are at the end of the road.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll also be talking to John MacGregor, about the privatization of British Rail, has he really given in to his rebels who want B R to be able to bid for the franchises, or is it all a clever conjuring trick?<endOfText>
<human>Have Labours's modernizers run into the buffers?<endOfText>
<bot>I'll be talking to arch modernizer Harriet Harman, and John Cole takes a sideways look at the Chancellor's dilemma as he prepares his first budget.<endOfText>
<human>But first to Northern Ireland.<endOfText>
<bot>It's difficult, impossible perhaps, for those of us who don't live their to fully understand the sheer horror of it.<endOfText>
<human>On a crude arithmetical basis if the same proportion of murders were carried out on the mainland of Britain in relation to the population we'd have had a thousand dead in the past eight days.<endOfText>
<bot>Unthinkable, no government could allow it to continue and expect to survive.<endOfText>
<human>So what is happening to find a political solution?<endOfText>
<bot>Well John Hume's meetings with Gerry Addams have been overshadowed by that meeting between the prime ministers of Great Britain and the Irish Republic, overshadowed and overtaken, according to Mr Major, I talked about that to John Hume a little earlier this morning, but I began by asking for his reaction to the latest murders.<endOfText>
<human>Well just another appalling slaughter of very innocent people, and it really is quite incredible that the people who carried out these terrible murders said they were doing so as retaliation for similar slaughter of people in the Shankhill Road last week.<endOfText>
<bot>The people murdered last week were every bit as innocent as were the people in the Shankhill Road, and I would be certain that the families of the people in the Shankhill Road would be horrified that the murder of their loved ones would be used as an excuse as an excuse to do exactly the same to other innocent people.<endOfText>
<human>You'll have known that pub, of course.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh aye, I know that pub well, it's just outside my constituency but it's in the district where it's in the North West, and we all know one another very well there.<endOfText>
<human>I haven't heard the names yet, of the people who have lost their lives but I'd be I would be certain that I would know some of them personally.<endOfText>
<bot>Where do we go from here?<endOfText>
<human>Well of course I've been saying for some time now, for some time, and I want to underline that, and I hope the government are listening  that we've had twenty thousand troops on our streets, we've twelve thousand armed policemen on our streets, we have the strictest security laws in Western Europe, and none of these things have solved our problem.<endOfText>
<bot>The number of people who have died on our streets is equivalent to a hundred thousand people dying in the streets of Britain, if that were happening, then the House of Commons would be packed to the doors everyday, until they got it sorted out.<endOfText>
<human>If the Government keeps telling us in every statement they make that we're an integral part of the .<endOfText>
<bot>I think I'm making my point, I have been saying for some time now that given the fact that all that security hasn't produced the results, the logic of that is dialogue, and when I see the opportunity as I saw it, of dialogue, direct dialogue with Mr Addams that could lead to a total cessation of this violence, I felt it was my duty to do so.<endOfText>
<human>That dialogue has lead me to the point of issuing a joint statement with Mr Addams.<endOfText>
<bot>Now remember I am the leader of a party that has been in the front line against his violence for twenty years, and have been at many risks, as have been members of my party, but when I say that that dialogue is the best hope they've seen for peace for twenty years.<endOfText>
<human>And in tha in our statement we say, that we are talking about a process which involves both governments, all parties, and what we're talking about is agreement among the divided people to which all sections can give their loyalty.<endOfText>
<bot>The least I would expect would be an immediate invitation from the Prime Minister, come and see me, because if it was happening on the streets of any city in Britain and the MP stood up and said what I've said I think he would be in Downing Street within the night.<endOfText>
<human>And you've not had that invitation?<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Are you awaiting for it?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I would expect that the Prime Minister would, I think this nonsense that is behind all this is that because I am talking to Gerry Adams, they don't want to be seen to be talking to me because it looks this fingerprint argument<endOfText>
<human>Your hands are dirty .<endOfText>
<bot>I'm talking about saving human life  governments over the last twenty years, troops over the last twenty years, policemen over the last twenty years, laws over the last twenty years, and politicians, including myself, have all failed in all the efforts that we've made including condemnation of violence, everything, but I am now saying that this dialogue is the best hope I've seen or, surely I'm entitled to say to the Prime Minister, alright given that I have said that why don't you put me to the test?<endOfText>
<human>But have you not already briefed Mr Major, have you not already briefed Downing Street about those talks, and given that you have, what else is there, what else can you offer Mr Major, that you haven't already offered?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, er, I think that both governments have said er in their, and both Prime Ministers, er and I'm glad they met, er that the <endOfText>
<human>That's Mr Reynolds, I assume .<endOfText>
<bot>Yes that they are beginning a process involving both governments and er naturally er I welcome that very much, because I think the attention of both governments would have to be concentrated on this terrible problem, and of course if they take the trouble to read the statement that Mr Addams and I issued that's precisely what we said, that the two governments should begin a process involving all parties.<endOfText>
<human>So what else do you have to offer then?<endOfText>
<bot>I think that both governments are aware of the proposals that emerged from th my dialogue with Mr Addams, and the process that has emerged, that I have said, and he has said is substantial progress towards lasting peace.<endOfText>
<human>I want the governments to act on it, and act quickly on it.<endOfText>
<bot>But act on what, do you see, this is what we don't understand ?<endOfText>
<human>Sorry, I know you don't understand, and you're not going to understand on this program.<endOfText>
<bot>Why not?<endOfText>
<human>Because er it's a that's that's just the way it has to be for the present, at the end of the <endOfText>
<bot>But does the Government ?<endOfText>
<human>Sorry.<endOfText>
<bot>At the end of the day the whole community has to know what this is all about, but let me stress, there is no threat in this process that is being proposed, to bring about a total cessation of violence, there is no threat to any section of our community, none what so ever.<endOfText>
<human>Does the Government, does Mr Major <endOfText>
<bot>know precisely what went on in your talks with Mr Addams, and does Mr Major approve of what you had agreed, or discussed with Mr Adams?<endOfText>
<human>Well I have no evidence of any description of Mr Majors approval or disapproval<endOfText>
<bot>But does he know?<endOfText>
<human>what he has said is that he, it's a matter for myself to talk to whoever I wish, and that he respects my judgement in these matters, er according to the joint statement issued Mr Reynolds briefed him on his discussions with me on that on that  <endOfText>
<bot>Right, he does know.<endOfText>
<human>well, I er it it I am only reading what er their joint statement said.<endOfText>
<bot>And he has said Mr <endOfText>
<human>But I am available.<endOfText>
<bot>But Mr Major has said quite clearly that that process that dialogue between you and Gerry Adams has run it's course.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, he has said that and I am saying, I am saying, as somebody who has been in the front line against this violence, and with due respect to Mr Major knows a little more about it than he does<endOfText>
<bot>So Mr Majors wrong?<endOfText>
<human>I am saying Mr Major, as Prime Minister, if someone in my position is saying I believe, I believe, there is the best opportunity here for lasting peace, by which I mean a total cessation of violence, the least I expect is that you should listen to what I have to say.<endOfText>
<bot>So he, Mr Major, is wrong when he says he believes that that dialogue, that process that you began with Gerry Adams has run its course do you <endOfText>
<human>Well <endOfText>
<bot>believe that there is further that can go and that it should be exploited by Mr Major or Mr Reynolds, or by Mr Major?<endOfText>
<human>well, when I say that it's the best opportunity for peace I've seen in twenty years.<endOfText>
<bot>If er Mr Major is not going to look at why I say that then I hope that he, I assume from that that he has a better hope of peace an an <endOfText>
<human>But he's looked at it hasn't he?<endOfText>
<bot>I'm sorry, and I'm waiting to hear what it is.<endOfText>
<human>But he's looked at it, because you have told Albert Reynolds <endOfText>
<bot>Well, what, why?<endOfText>
<human>Albert Reynolds has told the Prime Minister, Mr Major, Mr Major has taken on board, has has considered, presumably, what it is that you've done with Gerry Adams, and concluded that it can go no further.<endOfText>
<bot>Well i I'm not aware of how far he has taken anything on board, what I would expect as a Member of Parliament and the House of Commons, and as the leader of a party in the House of Commons, I would expect that he would want to hear what I would have to say face to face, and tell me face to face what's wrong with what I have said.<endOfText>
<human>Given that he doesn't want to see you and your suspicion is that he doesn't want to see you because you have as it were the fingerprints of Gerry Adams on you now you're tainted because of your relationship with Gerry Adams, what do you now do?<endOfText>
<bot>Do you have more meetings with Gerry Adams, do you try and to push it forward unilaterally?<endOfText>
<human>I am an elected representative of the people of Northern Ireland, three thousand three hundred of our people have been murdered, that's the equivalent of a hundred thousand people in Britain, it is the responsibility of every elected representative to do everything in their power, everything in their power, to stop that, The least responsibility that they have, the least they can do, is enter into dialogue directly with the people involved and I apologize to no-one for that, and if anybody is telling me that I'm tainted because I do that, you know, I don't know what sort of minds they've got, because I think it's our responsibility to do everything in our power to bring this violence to an end, and what's more, what I'm doing has massive support of ordinary people on both sections of our community because I have never in my twenty years experienced the nature of the support and the way that it's being expressed to me by people in the streets, by telephone, and in particular by <endOfText>
<bot>You <endOfText>
<human>families of those who have lost loved ones, who don't want to see other families going through the suffering that they have gone through.<endOfText>
<bot>You say that, but aren't isn't it th the case that the loyalists, the Protestants in Northern Ireland are terrified of any kind of deal that might involve Gerry Adams because that would be as far as they are concerned the ultimate sell out, and hence there is the danger of growing sectarian violence because of fear?<endOfText>
<human>Well in the first place, I have made clear throughout, and I have a record their of over twenty years that people can have a look at, but I made clear throughout, as has Mr Adams, that we are not engaged in secret deals, secret deals don't solve problems.<endOfText>
<bot>What we have said we are involved in a process which must involve both governments and all parties, whose objective is agreement among our divided people an agreement which all our traditions must give their allegiance and agreement, and an agreement which must express which which must respect our diversity, now I have kept repeating that statement since we made it and I asked anyone to tell me what they disagree with it, now the loyalist paramilitary some weeks ago said that if the I R A were to k their impression they've given all along is that they're just a reaction to the I R A and if the I R A were to stop they would cease immediately, I immediately put out a statement welcoming that statement by them, I also offered to talk directly to them, but they have refused er given the nature of their campaign, particularly at the moment, I begin to wonder do they want the I R A to stop?<endOfText>
<human>Have they some other reason for their resistance but are able to use the I R A as their excuse?<endOfText>
<bot>Whatever Mr Major's motives may be for having concluded that your that the process is at an end that your involvement, effectively, with Gerry Adams is at an end, what about Mr Reynolds' motives?<endOfText>
<human>What possible reason might he have for agreeing with Mr Major that the Hume Adams initiative is dead?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I have no evidence from either of them, you know, er that er they are slamming the door on my initiative, other than the statement that was issued which if you read it, there's very little in it that you can object to, or that I could object to, which commits them, the two governments to an initiative, and indeed that's what er the last statement that Mr Adams and I issued asked them to do, the only er they also in in their statements say that my actions have been both courageous and imaginative<endOfText>
<human>But that th the <endOfText>
<bot>er but that the that the they're not paying attention to what's coming out of it  <endOfText>
<human>But you clearly don't believe that that statement, the the Reynolds Major statement goes far enough.<endOfText>
<bot>Well er n well oh f I'm not saying that er i I'm available.<endOfText>
<human>John Hume .<endOfText>
<bot>That's what I'm saying.<endOfText>
<human>John Hume.<endOfText>
<bot>Tomorrow the Transport Secretary John MacGregor reintroduces the bill to privatize British Rail to the House of Commons, it had a rough journey through the House of Lords and until late last week it looked set for a stormy passage through the Commons too, but then Mr MacGregor introduced a series of amendments that everyone assumes will satisfy the rebellious Tory MP s, but as Michael Gold reports, there are still obstacles for Mr MacGregor to surmount.<endOfText>
<human>Train now approaching platform two is the twelve fifty three  service from Glasgow Central.<endOfText>
<bot>It's been a bumpy ride, but the bill to privatize British Rail is almost at the end of its long parliamentary journey  but the battle isn't over yet, earlier this week hundreds of protestors from a variety of backgrounds gave up a day and travelled from the North to carry their defiant message to Transport Secretary John MacGregor.<endOfText>
<human>It was railway workers who were in the vanguard of the protest, worried about job losses and safety, but Middle England was also on the march, concerned that services might suffer, polls indicate that four out of five voters oppose the sell off.<endOfText>
<bot>It's ridiculous, I don't think they really realize what they're doing.<endOfText>
<human>You cannot privatize British Rail, it cannot be done.<endOfText>
<bot>It's only a few people at this moment in this country, that does believe in railway privatization, and that is the Department of Transport.<endOfText>
<human>Leave the railways with British Rail, and put the money in that they would spend on privatization to improve the service for all of us, and keep it as a national railway, please.<endOfText>
<bot>Why is the Government embarking on such an apparently unpopular privatization?<endOfText>
<human>Some Tories think it's a sop to the right from a weakened premier, the Government insist that the sell off is the best way to attract investment from the private sector into the railways, but there are signs that the break up of B R isn't proving as attractive to outside investors as the government hoped.<endOfText>
<bot>Mayfair's Park Lane Hotel, art deco rendezvous for London's deal- makers.<endOfText>
<human>Would you like coffee, sir ?<endOfText>
<bot>Coffee, sir?<endOfText>
<human>Er white, please.<endOfText>
<bot>This week it was the venue for a gathering of bankers, managers, and academics, exploring the future of transport.<endOfText>
<human>Few at this conference were a-quiver at the prospect of bidding for the Tilbury to Southend line.<endOfText>
<bot>Among the experts who were there was Professor Bill Bradshaw.<endOfText>
<human>My name's Bradshaw.<endOfText>
<bot>Good morning.<endOfText>
<human>The Professor was advisor to the Tory dominated Transport Committee, and he's convinced the sell off will be a turn off.<endOfText>
<bot>The private sector cannot invest in the circumstances set out in the bill, because they need very long franchises with control of all the means of production, the track, the trains, the stations, the total business.<endOfText>
<human>That is not provided in the bill, the private sector will not invest, and our railways will go on getting more unreliable.<endOfText>
<bot>The business men and boffins here have made money moving people from A to B across the globe, but very few of the governments they've advised have ever tried to privatize their railways, and none have tried in quite the manner Mr MacGregor proposes.<endOfText>
<human>One man who is used to spending millions helping finance transport projects is Frank Borgus, he's helped oversee privatizations in the U S but from his perspective the B R sell off doesn't look attractive.<endOfText>
<bot>What you need to do is to be able to provide a private sector a certain level of certainty, that the concession will be er granted long enough so that one can recover both your costs an=and certainly be able to to make a profit and so er to the extent that the franchises that are being considered are short natured, seven years, er that becomes rather disadvantageous and unattractive er concessions of twenty and thirty and forty years, and and really thirty thirty to forty year period er do make it in fact make it very attractive for private sector involvement.<endOfText>
<human>That might seem to leave the Government in the dark, but they're confident they know where there going.<endOfText>
<bot>British Rail employees and managers will borrow cash, so the Government hopes, in order to buy profitable services, like the East Coast mainline from their employers.<endOfText>
<human>Getting their hands on their own trains might seem attractive, but any manager tempted would be taking a big risk.<endOfText>
<bot>The prospects for management buy-outs are really very bleak, the reason for that is that the franchises which we're hearing about are likely to be very short, the franchisee will own no assets, no land, no rolling stock, nothing with which to go to the bank as security for loan.<endOfText>
<human>At the end of the franchise period he will have nothing to sell, so I cannot see how people could go away and borrow the working capital with which to run a business.<endOfText>
<bot>The profitability of flagship lines like the Gatwick Express sustains the Government's belief there will be management buy-outs.<endOfText>
<human>Few managers would think of embarking on such a course if they faced competition from B R itself, that's why the Government originally barred B R from bidding.<endOfText>
<bot>However, when the bill reached the upper house Lord Paignton amended it to let B R bid, for two reasons.<endOfText>
<human>First because it er offers the Government quite a good reason for dropping the bill altogether, er a er and bowing to parliamentary opinion in doing so that's not a shameful thing to do, er if it had been able to do that on the other hand it would have the benefit of in=incorporating in its own proposals a measure of continuity and experience which are no there already.<endOfText>
<bot>The Lord's vote had reverberations along the corridor at Westminster, a number of MP s hitherto quietly concerned about privatization now went public, they thought the Lords vote would take the sting out of the sell off because B R would win most of the bids, ministers vowed to defy the rebels, but just before the bill left the Lords the Government seemed to cave in.<endOfText>
<human>Your Lordships will be aware that the Government has been giving careful consideration to the issue of whether B R should be a franchisee in the light of the noble lord Lord Paignton's amendment, agreed at committee stage.<endOfText>
<bot>Clearly my right honourable friend the secretary of state will want to hear the views of another place, but I can say that he will not be recommending that the amendment should be overturned.<endOfText>
<human>Even as Lord Caithness seemed to buckle the Government were tabling their own amendments to fix the odds against B R bids a finesse, but the rebels bought it.<endOfText>
<bot>I want to see the er possibility of British Rail being able to say, well you know we could improve our act, we could do things differently, and er we we wou we have experience of running a railway, and therefore, you know, please let us bid.<endOfText>
<human>That's why I thought it was wrong that er British Rail should not be allowed to bid, and I think that the Government's compromise is a very sensible one.<endOfText>
<bot>It was passengers who were supposed to benefit from Lord Paignton's amendment, the rebels think they've safeguarded the spirit of that vote, but experts disagree.<endOfText>
<human>The amendment the Government has put forward does not hold out much real hope for B R managers about remaining in the medium or long term in charge of viable business, to that extent the amendment does not carry out what I believe was the intention of Lord Paignton in in moving the amendment.<endOfText>
<bot>So Mr MacGregor's hard work may yet come to grief, even if he sorts that problem out there's another obstacle to privatization running smoothly, many on the railways think the private sector will need a generous subsidy before they'd be interested, if their not attracted the state will have to spend more to make the new structure work, a lot more.<endOfText>
<human>On The Record's obtained a paper prepared by a committee including senior civil servants and the Treasury and Transport Department, called the Restructuring Working Group, the report forecasts an increase in the amount of taxpayer's money subsidizing the railways, this year it will be eight hundred and fifty million pounds, after privatization, the paper says, the central government grant requirement would total some two billion pounds in nineteen ninety four ninety five.<endOfText>
<bot>By owning the track and leasing the trains the Government can recoup some money, but will that calm Tories who see millions spent on privatization while other budgets are cut.<endOfText>
<human>Mr MacGregor's avoided one collision with his back benchers, but when they realize the bills cost and consider how B R 's been dealt with the question is, will they think again?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, will they, Mr MacGregor?<endOfText>
<human>Have you, or have you not, please, accepted the Paignton amendment?<endOfText>
<bot>Well firstly the bill didn't have that rough a passage in the House of Lords, because there are only two basic amendments, er that we're dealing with in the House of Commons that matter, and one of them is the one you've just mentioned, the answer to it is this, er I've had a lot of criticisms of giving B R the untrammelled right to bid, er right from the outset their criticisms to do with the danger that you wouldn't get competition for the franchises the private sector would be afraid, and incidentally this is not a sell off it's it's a way of getting the private sector into British Rail with all the advantages that brings, they would be afraid that they would face subsidized and unfair competition, above all, perhaps, British Rail ge=management would feel if they were bidding against their employer that would be a real discouragement to bid, and we've a lot of evidence er that they feel that and that there are many who do wish to bid in management/employee buy outs, so what we've done in the amendment is we've preserved the right for British Rail to bid, but we've dealt with those criticisms and worries which have come from a lot of quarters not least from within British Rail itself.<endOfText>
<human>So, have you accepted the Paignton amendment?<endOfText>
<bot>I have accepted part of it, and I've amended it to ensure that we can overcome the criticisms er that would have been involved if we'd left it er as it was, er and above all, and I think this is the most important thing, we've made sure that it will work, er and that it will meet our objectives of getting competition into the franchises, if we'd just ended up with one great monolithic British Rail, after all each franchise remember will be coming gradually, they won't be doing them all at once, there will be one next year, several the year after, and so on , if British Rail had been able to go around and pick them off, and say, Well we can run this now in the future much better than we've done it in the past, so we'll bid, and we'll bid a low bid, that really wouldn't have been getting fair and proper competition into the system, so what i what I've done is ensured, as I've done all the way through in this bill in accepting amendments, that we make sure we achieve our objectives, and that above all it's workable, the, as it was it wouldn't as it was the Paignton amendment wouldn't have been workable, because there would have been total chaos and confusion <endOfText>
<human>Alright but <endOfText>
<bot>within British Rail itself.<endOfText>
<human>The reality is that you've said to British Rail, you can bid for those franchises that nobody else wants<endOfText>
<bot>The<endOfText>
<human>which is the situation anyway, because if people if nobody had bid British Rail would would have continued to <endOfText>
<bot>Well, well <endOfText>
<human>run them anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>of course that is a point that we've made all the way through, it's not if nobody would bid, it's if the franchising director was not satisfied with the quality or the long term viability of the bids he'd received<endOfText>
<human>Yes<endOfText>
<bot>or didn't think they were  <endOfText>
<human>Comes down to the same thing in the end.<endOfText>
<bot>Or they weren't, or, you see the other important point here is that British Rail will be restructuring all the twenty five potential passenger franchises, they're starting on this now<endOfText>
<human>They've just finished one restructuring .<endOfText>
<bot>they will then they will , they've just started actually<endOfText>
<human>But they've finished one .<endOfText>
<bot>No, well the key point is the key point is that they they have to have a period during which they have a track record of running those separate businesses, so that bidders will know the basis on which their bidding, now if  if the franchising director, it's entirely his decision, decides that er he's not getting competitive enough bids or good enough bids, then yes British Rail would carry on, and this was clear right from the outset, would carry on running that particular<endOfText>
<human>Right, so you actually <endOfText>
<bot>franchise, so the difference the difference now, is that they will be able er in some, certain circumstances to come in and bid directly at the outset.<endOfText>
<human>But only if the franchise director decides that there is not a viable bid from the private sector or from B R management.<endOfText>
<bot>Only if he feels that a private sector or B R management would be er frightened off bidding, and he knew that there were viable bids in play <endOfText>
<human>Yes, precisely.<endOfText>
<bot>and if he feels it would not <endOfText>
<human>But <endOfText>
<bot>lead to proper competition, that's correct .<endOfText>
<human>So let so nothing in reality has changed, has it?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh I'm quite sure there will be situations in which er British Rail will bid, and will, well it's up to the franchising director, but is likely to get the franchise, there will be situations.<endOfText>
<human>But then even if they do that and even if they get the franchise, they're not going to be able to say, we can now hold on to it for five, or seven, years, however long the franchise is going to be, because if another bidder comes along in the meantime and says, we rather like this ourselves, they'll be thrown off.<endOfText>
<bot>No, if they bid for the franchise, then, and get it, obviously that franchise runs for the period, and by the way, a lot of the criticisms in the film, I think were based on a misunderstanding that all the franchises are going to be short, they're not, those where there's a substantial investment going in can be quite a bit longer<endOfText>
<human>Well well how long, how long ?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh ou we haven't, it would depend on the market place, on the reaction .<endOfText>
<human>But but I mean are we talking about really <endOfText>
<bot>We could be talking of ten years and beyond, er beyond ten years .<endOfText>
<human>What, twenty years?<endOfText>
<bot>I doubt it, we no we wouldn't wish to go to, I don't think, to twenty years, er but it would depend on the level <endOfText>
<human>Tha tha that's interesting <endOfText>
<bot>it will it will depend on the level of investment that the bidder is prepared to put in we're being very flexible, responding to the market forces <endOfText>
<human>So that it might be then <endOfText>
<bot>But <endOfText>
<human>fifteen years, let's say where we've <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>been talking until now about seven years, we might be talking about fifteen years.<endOfText>
<bot>Well some people have been talking about five to seven years, I've been saying all the way through that we're very flexible on this, and clearly if erm a bidder whether it's a management buy out with other people in the bid, others in the consortium, or an outright bid from a private sector consortium er if if they get the franchise and make clear that that's on the basis that they're going to put a lot of money into the capital investment, then clearly they will want a longer period and we have made that clear .<endOfText>
<human>Well I may have missed something you've said, but I haven't heard you say fifteen years before .<endOfText>
<bot>I've said quite often that ga it could be <endOfText>
<human>I mean <endOfText>
<bot>flexible to a certainly to ten, and in the right circumstances beyond that.<endOfText>
<human>So I can take it as as gospel this morning that some of these franchises will be fifteen years, how many might be fifteen years, might they all be fifteen years ?<endOfText>
<bot>If, if, if, they are prepared  if they're prepared to put sufficient funding in er into the capital investment side.<endOfText>
<human>So if they all come along with lots and lots of money they'll all have fifteen years.<endOfText>
<bot>Well now you see, I don't think they'll do that, because another, another, another,<endOfText>
<human>I'm sure they won't from what we've been told .<endOfText>
<bot>another mistake in the film was to suggest that in a a short franchise, say of seven years they would need a great deal of working capital, but they won't need a great deal of working capital or or share capital, they will actually be running a business where they get subsidy, because if er they're involving socially necessary lines, like commuter lines, or or rural lines, then we've made it very clear er that the taxpayers subsidy will continue, because these are loss making businesses, they will be bid they will bid for subsidy, and they will continue to get that subsidy, so they will have the flow of whatever income they can increase, in the passenger franchise, plus the subsidy, plus, and this is a very important point in what we're doing in the restructuring of British Rail, you see, nobody up till now has said that British Rail is perfect, everyone acknowledges that there are big improvements to be made, the way we're structuring it will get those improvements because the smaller franchises, not the great big monolithic nationalized industry, the smaller units,ha will be able to identify much more clearly where they can make the savings and where they can increase the revenue .<endOfText>
<human>But they won't be able to deal with their main sources of production, as er Professor Bradshaw said there, they're going to have absolutely you've got no control over the track on on which they operate, and they ar going to have to hire their carriages from and rolling stock from a separate leasing company, so their room for manoeuvre is limited to say the least .<endOfText>
<bot>That's, that's, that's in a very small, er short franchise which is very similar to operators in other<endOfText>
<human>What so they  <endOfText>
<bot>passeng in in other in other transport areas<endOfText>
<human>So that if it's a fifteen-year <endOfText>
<bot>but you see it, I me <endOfText>
<human>franchise, they may actually get, I'm I'm <endOfText>
<bot>They <endOfText>
<human>I'm very puzzled by this now so I ask for clarification, if it's a long franchise then, if it's a fifteen year franchise, are you saying that the franchisee will have control over the track?<endOfText>
<bot>And over the rolling stock?<endOfText>
<human>They may, let me just explain the track then, in those situations they may well be investing in the depots, maintenance and so on, but let me just <endOfText>
<bot>And the track?<endOfText>
<human>let me just go beyond<endOfText>
<bot>So but but just answer that bit first, so I'm clear <endOfText>
<human>not, not, not on the track as not on <endOfText>
<bot>Right so, so <endOfText>
<human>the track as such, can I just explain the position on the <endOfText>
<bot>Alright.<endOfText>
<human>track, because it it, no other transport business er has er does has to have a business, which op owns both the track it's operating on and the operating er facilities themselves, so the we're not doing anything new here, what we are actually doing, and incidentally the German government and other governments are going down the same route now because it's not true to say that others aren't privatizing, what we're doing is saying that we are having a separate track authority, and there are a variety of reasons for that, er but the an and that means actually less investment by the franchisee himself, but he will have control over the th the track operations, because he will have a contract, with Rail Track, to deliver certain services, and if Rail Track doesn't deliver them then he's able to claim penalties so <endOfText>
<bot>But he <endOfText>
<human>he will have the same relationship as so many other companies have er in relationship to other services they need to operate their business.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's just consider the political problem though you have still got a problem selling it to a lot of MP s, if they're listening to this interview and they are concluding, maybe rightly, maybe wrongly, that actually things aren't changing very much, and they may think they've been sold a pup with these amendments, indeed I hear that some of them have had to be bought off, well, is it true that one of them was sent off to Peru on an on an election er supervision mission in order that he might not be around when the bill came up .<endOfText>
<human>He's, he's actually going to be there to to vote for the bill  vote for the amendment <endOfText>
<bot>But was he, he was sent off to Peru as a sweetener, was he ?<endOfText>
<human>well there are, no, no, because he's going to be there to vote, but on, on <endOfText>
<bot>Yes  <endOfText>
<human>Can I deal with your main point, er and in's very important, er, to understand this, er, the vast majority of the parliamentary party supports strongly what we're doing, because they believe it will improve passenger services, it will deal with getting freight on, more freight on to rail, now they they backed it throughout the party conference backed it almost unanimously<endOfText>
<bot>Alright,n <endOfText>
<human>what we're dealing with is a small group of MP s who thought there were some advantages in the Paignton amendment I've discussed it very thoroughly with them for some time, and they agree that there were real difficulties about the Paignton amendment which I've now addressed<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, let me talk about money then, do <endOfText>
<human>so there are an awful lot of people, let me say, there is th it is a complete falsehood to suggest that the parliamentary party isn't behind the bill<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, money <endOfText>
<human>we had a meeting earlier this week were I got huge support, indeed some were urging me not to give way at all on the Paignton amendment.<endOfText>
<bot>Money.<endOfText>
<human>Two billion pounds, it's going to cost you, going to cost us, the taxpayers .<endOfText>
<bot>I, that, there have been endless position papers in the department and I haven't actually seen that one<endOfText>
<human>Well, here it is.<endOfText>
<bot>the I don't  <endOfText>
<human>You haven't seen it?<endOfText>
<bot>It's, it's, it's, it's a committee that you set up, the Restructuring Working Group that that your department set up .<endOfText>
<human>But they do loads of that way way down in preparing all these things, and loads and loads of different views expressed at different times, I deal with actually the recommendations er as we get to the point of decision, but on the on the investment point<endOfText>
<bot>Well is it true, or is it not true that it is going to cost an extra tw , total, I'm sorry, not an extra, total of two billion pounds.<endOfText>
<human>No I don't recognize that figure although it it er it what matters, is that we continue <endOfText>
<bot>Well that's not quite the same as saying it isn't true, if I can just push you on that a little bit, you <endOfText>
<human>Well <endOfText>
<bot>say you don't recognize it, is it true?<endOfText>
<human>Now that I know that <endOfText>
<bot>For, for ninety four, ninety five <endOfText>
<human>and I've told you where it's come from, can you say that is too much<endOfText>
<bot>It is not necessary, to have it on that scale er in nineteen ninety four ninety five <endOfText>
<human>That's not the same as saying it isn't true is it?<endOfText>
<bot>it isn't necessary, well it is the same as saying it isn't true, it isn't necessary er because this will be built up over a period and it will be for er the Government in all the normal ways in the public expenditure round to decide how much goes into the passenger franchises and through that therefore into the Briti the Rail Track investment.<endOfText>
<human>Either way it's going to be an awful <endOfText>
<bot>But <endOfText>
<human>lot more than eight <endOfText>
<bot>But <endOfText>
<human>hundred and fifty million pounds, isn't it ?<endOfText>
<bot>But can I just make the point that we have been investing a great deal in British Rail, and the idea that er all over the piece we're talking about non-modernized railways simply not true.<endOfText>
<human>Eight hundred million on the East Coast main line, four hundred million for rolling stock announced this week, four hundred million in new contracts, there's a lot of money going in right now .<endOfText>
<bot>The ex the extra cost of privatization is going to be one heck of a lot more than than without any privatization, in that year we're talking about immediately, is it not ?<endOfText>
<human>No it's certainly not, in nineteen ninety four ninety five, certainly not .<endOfText>
<bot>Not going to be more than eight hundred and fifty?<endOfText>
<human>Because were on not going to be of the scale that you were suggesting <endOfText>
<bot>Well <endOfText>
<human>for the very simple reason that we will at most have one franchise in er nineteen ninety four, ninety five<endOfText>
<bot>Well<endOfText>
<human>and so there will only be one franchise, this will build up gradually.<endOfText>
<bot>Well let me quote to you what your own document says, on <endOfText>
<human>I, I <endOfText>
<bot>the best view we have at the moment transfer of service from B R to franchises is likely to increase the subsidy requirement for the service in question a large upward leap in nineteen ninety four ninety five, now this is your own document and attending these on er on <endOfText>
<human>I, I <endOfText>
<bot>on this restructuring group it's British Rail, it's the Treasury, it's the Department of Transport, it's the franchise director.<endOfText>
<human>It is that is a paper from somebody, I know not who, but can I just explain, if we're having one franchise passenger service next year, which is pretty well all you can do because you do need to have that record, track record, the business operating as a separate business before bidders can bid, if we're having one next year, to suggest as I think the quote was, that the that would cost about one point two billion pounds is ridiculous, it's ridiculous, a single, a single,<endOfText>
<bot>What your group's quote, not mine, well must tell them then, will you go in tomorrow morning and say redo this working paper?<endOfText>
<human>a single passenger service costing that amount of money, absolutely not.<endOfText>
<bot>Well where did they suck it from then, I mean I <endOfText>
<human>Don't ask me.<endOfText>
<bot>know it's it's it's not something that I've put together.<endOfText>
<human>But it isn't actually the real point, the real point is that we will continue, well it <endOfText>
<bot>Oh it's a very important point, isn't it, if it's going to cost a great deal more to push privatization through when you've got a fifty billion overspend anyway, I'd have thought people who were worried about V A T on fuel would say that is a very significant point.<endOfText>
<human>But it isn't because I've just said to you several times that one point two billion for a single franchise is absolutely ridiculous .<endOfText>
<bot>Well, give me a figure then.<endOfText>
<human>It will be, it will depend on the bidding but it <endOfText>
<bot>Alright.<endOfText>
<human>for and we will continue the subsidies to the passenger service<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>individual franchises will vary, depending on how successful they are and what the bids are<endOfText>
<bot>Final very  <endOfText>
<human>but it won't be that scale.<endOfText>
<bot>Final very quick question, reports in the paper this morning that Chunnel, the the channel tunnel, the high speed link, and the tunnel itself are going to be delayed because the Treasury basically saying, we've run out of money, you can't do it, is that true?<endOfText>
<human>Delayed until two thousand and five, maybe.<endOfText>
<bot>The point about two thousand and five is complete speculation.<endOfText>
<human>So is the main report true?only got a few seconds, I'm sorry .<endOfText>
<bot>Let me tell let me tell you exactly Jubilee line is going ahead, er very large sums of money in the next three years <endOfText>
<human>Yes, lets talk about talk about channel tunnel high <endOfText>
<bot>We <endOfText>
<human>speed link.<endOfText>
<bot>The Cross-Rail and channel tunnel high speed link are at nothing like the state of preparedness of Jubilee Line, that's going ahead now after a lot of work, er th it it will not be the case er it that you can do either of those very quickly, Cross-Rail's only just started going through the House of Commons .<endOfText>
<human>So there is going to be a delay.<endOfText>
<bot>So, we can't tell what the final deadline date will be because there are so many pro processes, to go through.<endOfText>
<human>John MacGregor, thank you very much indeed.<endOfText>
<bot>Yesterday the Labour coordinating committee met for its annual get together, now this is the body that has set itself the task of modernizing the Labour Party, a difficult task at the best of times, made more difficult now because there is a growing shortage of volunteers for the cause, they can't even raise enough members to fill their own executive.<endOfText>
<human>Earlier this morning I suggested to arch modernizer Harriet Harman that she and her reforming colleagues had run into the buffers.<endOfText>
<bot>Absolutely not, I think there's a strong sense in the Party that moving forward with our traditional values, that what we have to do is to apply those traditional values to a very changed world, things are very different now from when the Labour Party was formed, or even from when the Labour Party was last in government, so that we keep our sense of values, they are what grounds us, but what makes us an effective government in the future is the fact that we are moving forward with the times, and the increasing representation of women is one of the things which is about moving us forward, and moving with the times.<endOfText>
<human>Talk about the increasing representation of women, there were meant to be more women in the shadow cabinet with the elections for the shadow cabinet produced a disaster for women didn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>They were abs <endOfText>
<human>a disaster for you.<endOfText>
<bot>They were absolutely not a disaster for women, obviously I would have preferred to stay on the shadow cabinet, but we have three women in the shadow cabinet, and we have a number of women in senior positions outside the shadow cabinet .<endOfText>
<human>You'd like to have more.<endOfText>
<bot>Well the trend though over all is absolutely clear, that the Labour Party is committed to increasing women's representation and is absolutely on that path, we've more Labour women MP s and increasing numbers of women in the shadow cabinet it's only in the end of the nineteen eighties, as recently as then, that we had no women in the shadow cabinet, now everybody agrees that it would look quite wrong not to have women in the shadow cabinet, we've got a woman deputy leader, three women in the shadow cabinet, and therefore we're definitely moving forward.<endOfText>
<human>You say the Labour Party is agreed that there should be more women in the shadow cabinet, but which is this Labour Party then, the parliamentary Labour Party certainly isn't, there was a conspiracy to keep women out.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think there was a conspiracy to keep <endOfText>
<human>Well Anne Clywd does.<endOfText>
<bot>Well I don't <endOfText>
<human>Lots of other people do.<endOfText>
<bot>No, I think that we would have liked to have seen more women, I would have liked to have stayed on the Shadow Cabinet, and I would have liked to have seen more women in the Shadow Cabinet, but to say it's a disaster, and somehow we've moved away from the path we've set ourself is simply not the case.<endOfText>
<human>Alright, let me substitute setback, for disaster then, how about that?<endOfText>
<bot>Well I think it's it's a hiccup, nothing more, but I think the trend is clearly established, and it's very much agreed, it's recognized in the Labour Party, that the world outside has changed, women are now half the workforce, women are now half the college and university graduates, women's work now represents forty percent of our G D P, so we have to increase women's representation to recognize the world has changed.<endOfText>
<human>Why isn't that message getting across to the P L P then?<endOfText>
<bot>Or to the er to the gentlemen in the P L P?<endOfText>
<human>Well I think that message is getting across to the P L P and we've seen more women coming into the House of Commons, sitting on the Labour benches at the last general election, but there also is a sense that the progress, although it's being made, needs to be speeded up, because when you have profound social changes outside the House of Commons, with a change in women's role in society, a change in women's role in the Labour force, and a change in women's role in the family as well, you can't allow your parliament to lag behind.<endOfText>
<bot>So bearing all that in mind then, you sent exactly the wrong signal, didn't you with the elections to the Shadow Cabinet?<endOfText>
<human>Well I think that it is possible that as a result of the reporting of the Shadow Cabinet elections, that the sense was out in the public that somehow this was a setback for women, and that Labour <endOfText>
<bot>It was, wasn't it?<endOfText>
<human>no, because the point is that Labour has not changed it's course, which is recognizing that at the heart of it's policies we have to show that we know the world has changed, and we've got a message to women, which is that we know that you are essential in your role in the family, but we know you're also essential in the economy,<endOfText>
<bot>But, but <endOfText>
<human>and as bread winners for your family, and the way we do that is making sure that we have a parliamentary Labour Party of men and women, and that we're a party of men and women at all levels, and all <endOfText>
<bot>But it's what <endOfText>
<human>and all Labour MP s would agree with that.<endOfText>
<bot>But it's what, well would they?<endOfText>
<human>I mean it's one thing <endOfText>
<bot>Yes, I think they would.<endOfText>
<human>to have a course, but if the crew on that particular ship mutinies, as they did during the last er Shadow Cabinet, then you're in trouble, aren't you?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean look,for forgetting the women, but just look look at who else did well in those elections and who did less well, you had the modernizers doing less well, the Tony Blairs and the Gordon Browns, and you had the traditionalists, or the perceived traditionalists if you prefer, er the John Prescotts, for instance, and the Frank Dobsons doing extremely well.<endOfText>
<human>Well I think it's not helpful to look at it with such stark divisions, I think everybody's clear <endOfText>
<bot>But those are the realities.<endOfText>
<human>No they're not the realities, because what we're saying is that we have to modernize the policies of the Labour Party, but the policies are absolutely based in our traditional concerns, I mean, let me give you an example, when Beveridge was talking about unemployment, and the life long need for people to work, he was talking about a male workforce, where it was a man supported by a non-working wife, now we still have at the absolute heart of our concerns in the Labour Party peoples need to work, but we're now talking about a situation, where women are sharing with their husbands the role of bed breadwinner, and in many families the woman is the sole breadwinner, and therefore our policies about employment and the economy recognize that the world has changed, our principles are the same, but the world to which we're applying it is very different, and, again, on that you see there would be no distinction between the so-called traditionalists and the so-called modernizers.<endOfText>
<bot>Well then what explains the er the rise and rise of the so-called traditionalists and the falling back of the so-called modernizers.<endOfText>
<human>Well I just think it's not helpful to look at it in those terms, you don't actually, if you pick <endOfText>
<bot>Well it  it may not be helpful, but it is the reality, isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Well no it isn't, no, no .<endOfText>
<bot>You can't close your eyes and say, it isn't there, if I don't look it'll go away.<endOfText>
<human>No it's not, because it simply attaches labels to the people and doesn't understand what's going on,<endOfText>
<bot>Ah, but <endOfText>
<human>and <endOfText>
<bot>the real politics of it is that those labels are attached, and you know that as well as I do.<endOfText>
<human>No, what we have to look at is not the labels which are attached to each individuals, but say do we have <endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>a good team of people in the Shadow Cabinet, do we have an excellent team i people in the parliamentary Labour Party, do we know where we've come from, and do no we know where we're going, and we do .<endOfText>
<bot>Right, now will let m l Let me ask you where you are going then as far as the Party's own constitution is concerned, we saw a development, a significant development that I no doubt you would say at the Labour Party conference er er down in Brighton, but not withstanding O M O B the trade unions still have one third of the votes in the selection of the leader of the party, seventy percent say on policy matters at conference, there is still a trade union block vote.<endOfText>
<human>That isn't a modern party, is it?<endOfText>
<bot>Well it certainly is, and we think that we've had an examin of our co , examination of the constitution, we've made a number of changes, but the task for Labour now is to press on with the issues of looking at our policies, and making sure that our economic policy and our social policy a actually meets the changes that are out their in the world .<endOfText>
<human>So that's it, that's, so that's it then for the modernization of the Party's constitution, we we what happened at Brighton was the end of the process was it?<endOfText>
<bot>What we've got now is what we're going to have in another ten years time?<endOfText>
<human>Well I think people think that a certain amount of time and attention has to be devoted to the Party's constitution, and there are two things that arose out of the conference in Brighton.<endOfText>
<bot>One member, one vote, for the selection of Labour members of parliament, but also increasing the representation of women, now people want to move on from that, they want a <endOfText>
<human>In what direction?<endOfText>
<bot>well, they want us to move on to developing the policies which have addressed the changed world .<endOfText>
<human>Ah, so that's it for the Party, though is it?<endOfText>
<bot>Well <endOfText>
<human>That, that the change to the constitution has ch that's it, all done.<endOfText>
<bot>Well I think people are settled on the changes that have been made, and want to move on, and I don't think <endOfText>
<human>Right, so the answer to my question, of I may just th th clarify this, the answer to my question is, yes that is it now, we have finished with the modernizing of the Party itself, lets forget about policies for one moment, we'll come back to that, but we have finished with the modernizing of the Party.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that people don't want to see any more constitutional changes, but there are many more changes in the culture, in the way the Party operates at local, regional, and national level, which we will be addressing, but what we're not going to have is more constitutional changes, because people feel that we've made changes, we have moved the Party forward, we're clear the direction we're going in, and now the Party at all levels wants to address itself not only to building our membership, but also to showing how the policies we've got meet the changed world outside.<endOfText>
<human>So it's okay in a modern Labour Party for the trades unions to have what is effectively still a block vote?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, certainly people are satisfied with where we've got to and want to draw a line underneath it and move on from there, and I think the prospect of going back to the constitution er issues, and they m once again being a key focus, I don't think anyone in the Party, or outside the Party, sees the Labour Party wanting to devote itself to that at this time .<endOfText>
<human>Alright, policies then, the economy.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm Gordon Brown is giving in, is he not to pressure from the traditionalists, when it comes to soaking the rich, or soaking the middle class, he's now saying, well maybe there will be a bit of soaking the rich, or soaking the middle class, whereas he wanted to say, and you wanted him to say, no we're not going to do that, we moved away from that.<endOfText>
<human>No, what we're saying is two things, firstly that we are not in favour of taxation for taxation's sake<endOfText>
<bot>Well no party is.<endOfText>
<human>it's not a reflex action that the Labour Party somehow engages in, but there are things that we need to rave raise revenue for, such as investment in the economy, like our social policies, and that the way that we will raise revenue is that we we will have a fair taxation system, that is very straightforward, and agreed by the Party, unlike the Conservatives who firstly don't recognize there is any purpose in investment in the economy, public investment, or investment in social policies they don't agree with, and secondly, when they do have to raise money they do it in the unfairest possible way, penalizing most those who can least <endOfText>
<bot>Let <endOfText>
<human>afford it.<endOfText>
<bot>Let me just suggest to you that you are sending all the wrong signals on women, on Party constitution, on economic matters, on policy matters, the modernizers have lost the impetus, they're sending the wrong signals.<endOfText>
<human>The Party is sending the wrong signals.<endOfText>
<bot>I think it's absolutely not the case to say that we're sending the wrong signals, I think there's a recognition in the country that the economy has been mismanaged, and the price that's being exacted by people is too high, high levels of unemployment, low levels of growth, and social services undermined, and people recognize that Labour is setting out a new way forward.<endOfText>
<human>Harriet Harman.<endOfText>
<bot>And now John Cole on the options facing the Chancellor in his first budget, one month from now.<endOfText>
<human>This year's battle of the budget is generating more anguish than any for years, John Major's cabinet now realize what a parliamentary mess December might turn into with week-long debates on both the Queen's speech and the budget to pack in, and worse to come in the spring, a budget combining taxes with public spending seemed a good idea at the time Norman Lamont announced it, but with November the thirtieth just a month away the political down-side is appearing, of course with a fifty billion pound deficit in the Government's accounts this years spending round would have been hard pounding anyhow, but the usual noisy haggle over the available cash among departments is now amplified by posses of Tory backbenchers trying to head off this or that tax increase, and there's an incentive to keep that up right through the finance bill after Christmas, since most new taxes would not come in until April.<endOfText>
<bot>A phrase from the Conservative's manifesto last year, we are the only party that understands the need for low taxation, has now returned to haunt them, for an MP in a marginal constituency this evokes the electoral ghost of George Bush, so he firmly rules out increases in income tax, but wouldn't mind putting V A T on newspapers and books.<endOfText>
<human>But would it be within the spirit of the manifesto to murmur, read my lips, no more direct taxes?<endOfText>
<bot>Really, he says, people don't notice V A T so much, others believe income tax will have to take some of the strain, but not by putting up the rates, that would be too blatant.<endOfText>
<human>The best bet is that the Chancellor will confine higher allowances against tax to the lowest grade, thus asking the better off to pay a bit more.<endOfText>
<bot>On the spending side, with the total fixed, the game this year is robbing Peter to pay Paul, or rather, to pay Malcolm.<endOfText>
<human>Defence Secretary Rifkind is reported to be grateful for support from the fourteen military minded Conservatives whose confidential letter to the Prime Minister was somehow left lying on a copying machine for a Labour researcher to find, but he is irritated by the leak, an insider murmurs that Malcolm's notching up black marks for the future.<endOfText>
<bot>Peter Lilley as a right winger has to combine his reputation as a zealous cutter of the state sector with a departmental budget that eats up to forty percent of the hole, one MP groans, rather inconsequentially, a weeks social security payments would buy a warship, even Kenneth Clark and Michael Portillo, sharpening their axes have to admit that Lilley did not exactly invent unemployment personally, but the burgeoning budget for invalidity benefit, together with much anecdotal evidence, suggest that somebody in Whitehall, well before his time, decided to cut the unemployment figures artificially by allowing, even encouraging people with little hope of jobs to remember that troublesome pain in their backs, and in the process get better benefits.<endOfText>
<human>But cutting this benefit will throw up hard cases, what worries a Tory elder is the way younger MP s approach the decision whether to support the Government on a pick and mix principle, he says, they no longer see the need to take the rough with smooth, to vote for the things they detest as well as those they like.<endOfText>
<bot>According to one loyalist thirties thirty or so of his colleagues think it's more fun to vote against the Government, a smaller number go further, they think a spell in opposition might enhance their own careers.<endOfText>
<human>But a member of the cynical tendency jeers that after all this brouhaha, a Prime Minister who's obsessed with political safety, will only allow minor pain, though back benchers will be encouraged to squeal so as to impress the markets.<endOfText>
<bot>But what, he demands, about the panic when interest rates go up to fund the deficit, and the City begins to think that Labour will win.<endOfText>
<human>A former senior minister who has been through many spending rounds says we take them all much too seriously, they are merely a mating ritual, he says, adding, and a barren one at that, no offspring.<endOfText>
<bot>Well you can tell that to the Treasury, or to the Marines.<endOfText>
<human>John Cole.<endOfText>
<bot>That's it for this week, until next week at the same time, good afternoon.<endOfText>
<human><endOfText>
<bot>Okay Ron there are, thanks for coming over for a start, there are you've got all the er the brochure and the er obviously the application form.<endOfText>
<human>The first time I've had a chance to have a look through this so could I erm<endOfText>
<bot>Yes by all <endOfText>
<human>ask you to while I read this the the six companies where we market our brochures or product <endOfText>
<bot>Okay <endOfText>
<human>are represented there.<endOfText>
<bot>Er for your background there's a there's obviously a a ha an obvious group but er those are the six companies.<endOfText>
<human>If I can just er read through this.<endOfText>
<bot>That company we bought erm in June last year so it's er a fairly newish launch for us but they're<endOfText>
<human>I've an idea myself for the golf er <endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>and that was erm supplying them with a complete mar tee marker board with a plan of the hole and an advert on that particular hole .<endOfText>
<bot>Oh you oh you mean up on the board or <endOfText>
<human>On the board.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes okay.<endOfText>
<human>Advertise sell that hole and er just basically supply the tee markers free of charge.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes all the er tees on our my own my own course are er sponsored by local businesses.<endOfText>
<human>Well that's what I was going to personally <endOfText>
<bot>that's individual eighteen holes mind you know.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>What I was going to do was erm just get a good quality joiner have he gives me a price for doing that and then I basically sell the advertising.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah that he we've just completed  up here and one or two others er so we're we're getting some big boys in now .<endOfText>
<human>But you've not you've not done that particular idea, tees?<endOfText>
<bot>No no we've we're we are er publishers printers that's where our background is.<endOfText>
<human>That's where we've been for the last twenty years so erm this company er that was already doing it  and we bought it into the er into the fold.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>Er can I just pick up on one or two points er Ron.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm at present you are employed by  and you you've got own you've got a company car.<endOfText>
<human>Have you got your own car?<endOfText>
<bot>Er no but that's no problem to buy a car.<endOfText>
<human>Well if you think it's no  problem fine .<endOfText>
<bot>So rather than have er two cars plus a company car I just sold my car.<endOfText>
<human>Well I understand that I mean a lot of people do that.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm however erm a company er a car is needed to do this job so I I home in on that.<endOfText>
<human>Er when we have erm when you come down for, you know if if if we decide that this is for you, er when you come down for a training course they expect to see a car.<endOfText>
<bot>You know in other words <endOfText>
<human>will help me driving.<endOfText>
<bot>In other words erm they won't allocate an assignment unless you have er have a car.<endOfText>
<human>It's as simple as that cos we could send you off to St Andrews or something like that to er to well I'm just I'm homing in on the erm on the golf on the basis that I you you're er you're representative for a a company that does is involved with golf equipment.<endOfText>
<bot>Yep?<endOfText>
<human>Erm  sports or just  golf industry.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>Oh I've seen there in fact my wife's got a set of Howsons so<endOfText>
<bot>Has she?<endOfText>
<human>Is that the  <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm you've been with them since August.<endOfText>
<human>Er what why are you er?<endOfText>
<bot>Well quite simply er my reason is that erm I'll read the letter to you that I dictated to the Sales Manager a week ago.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>It says,To Mr  Sales and Marketing Direct .<endOfText>
<human>Dear Graham, Further to our recent conversation by telephone I now wish to put on paper my complaints regarding you and the company.<endOfText>
<bot>You employed me in August nineteen ninety three at  to join  Sports U K on their behalf.<endOfText>
<human>Your offer of employment was accepted on the terms of the contract agreed that if my figures attained would reach your targets I could earn twenty five thousand per annum minimum.<endOfText>
<bot>The salary would base as my basic salary plus commission plus bonuses on a monthly basis and most importantly the promise that because the basic wage was so low, the lowest in the golf industry by your own words, er that there was to be a rise of approximately four thousand in January nineteen ninety four.<endOfText>
<human>Which you repeated many times to the sales reps and that you also would be have er would get us new cars.<endOfText>
<bot>The cars were honoured as agreed.<endOfText>
<human>I also took on the position knowingly of the bad reputation in Scotland of  Sports to the trade regarding hotel sales of your equipment, but was promised that this practice would be cut out.<endOfText>
<bot>It never did and you continued to supply a person who to this date continues to do these hotel sales.<endOfText>
<human>I have also complained to you continually about the loss of orders I have taken from my customers, ie back orders which get lost on the computer or they are not delivered due to the lack of stock.<endOfText>
<bot>The customer gives up after a few months waiting.<endOfText>
<human>In the past few months the complaints from my area from my customers that they are disgusted with the service they have received from  Sports.<endOfText>
<bot>Er at least thirty percent of my business erm have either stopped their accounts or reached the limit of their patience.<endOfText>
<human>With regards to my salary increase of January ninety four, recently you have now stated my increase with be take place in April ninety four.<endOfText>
<bot>Another promise broken.<endOfText>
<human>Even though I have reached my monthly target I still receive no bonuses but you tell me I am on target for the large bonus in April.<endOfText>
<bot>Er and I have put in brackets, What a month this could be.<endOfText>
<human>I have also found that rep the reps are all on different basic wages.<endOfText>
<bot>When challenged about this you replied, Yes, but you have the least experience in the golf industry.<endOfText>
<human>And I have replied er, Who in the past six months has reached their targets percentage targets above mine in the last six months?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah okay.<endOfText>
<human>I think I've got your drift.<endOfText>
<bot>Basically what I'm doing is<endOfText>
<human>Can I can I just go back hotel sales, is that where they supply er <endOfText>
<bot>They are they er are doing a practice which is the only golf company in industry who are supplying a friend of a friend who is going round Scotland doing hotel sales cheap.<endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah all right.<endOfText>
<bot>There are so many clubs they should <endOfText>
<human>I think I think I've been to one or two in York.<endOfText>
<bot>Well they're selling them cheaper than I can supply my customers.<endOfText>
<human>Are your customers mainly<endOfText>
<bot>Pro professionals.<endOfText>
<human>On clubs or<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>And shops golf shops?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>So basically they've broken their contract with me and he's not even responded to that letter.<endOfText>
<bot>So<endOfText>
<human>But his response is likely to be well part company, is that it?<endOfText>
<bot>I anticipating that is what response will be because I have er basically called him and er<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>If that's his case then I'll take him for breach of contract.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>On the basis of that you're actively looking around?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>Now my colleague John  spoke with you and he he outlined as much as he possibly can on the on the space on the telephone.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm and his interests in you was twofold.<endOfText>
<human>First of all he heard the voice was  okay .<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Because he would have told you I hope that er we sell advertising space into, well you've seen some samples over there.<endOfText>
<bot>Er I'm going to step, sorry before I go into a bit more detail in your C on your er application form, three things will be decided here today Ron and that's first of all whether you and I think that er  is a lau a launch pad for you to earn erm er some good money<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>and er I'm sure John will have told you how good the money can be if if we<endOfText>
<human>We didn't get to depth and and<endOfText>
<bot>All right.<endOfText>
<human>I I we're only talking ever averages and on target earnings.<endOfText>
<bot>We don't promise or guarantee anything.<endOfText>
<human>What we do say is that we will give you an opportunity erm er if you like a platform for er for earning good money <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>and er it is all down to the graft er an individual puts into it.<endOfText>
<bot>The only reason er top earners are top earners in our company is they don't sit back and take one deal a day<endOfText>
<human>That's right <endOfText>
<bot>they feel comfortable<endOfText>
<human>Er er if there if there's a part there I've dis I think I've answered that question in er personal at the end<endOfText>
<bot>Over over here?<endOfText>
<human>Yep.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm I think just I've answered that just probably the way you put it.<endOfText>
<human>Yep.<endOfText>
<bot>I er in fact you've wrapped it up in one sentence.<endOfText>
<human>That's the only way that any I believe anybody even when they're on a salary.<endOfText>
<bot>Because salary company car BUPA and all that is only commission in another form and they can take it away and and not give it to you just the same as any other company.<endOfText>
<human>Erm well okay so we'll decide today er you and me whether we feel  's the right er er space for you to be.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm and you realize of course that it's self employed commission only hence the need for the car.<endOfText>
<human>Er secondly if we get a if we if we get round that that er corner then the other two are fairly easily decidable and that is er where you and I also think erm your talents and your even your desire to be environmentally, that's the environment you work in erm most er suitable.<endOfText>
<bot>There are six companies there er five of which erm I can recruit for.<endOfText>
<human>I'm in the luxurious position of not just saying that one person comes in here for one job.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Erm I have four or five people I can take on for any one of those companies so nobody's in competition with <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>each other today.<endOfText>
<bot>And secondly erm because we're rather keen for people to er carry on the momentum we actually say to you when can you start and if it's next week wonderful.<endOfText>
<human>If it's the week after fine.<endOfText>
<bot>The further out of course it's a bit a bit messy.<endOfText>
<human>And so we are we look for that sort of commitment before people leave er the room today.<endOfText>
<bot>And I would tell you ninety nine percent of the time we get it and you know we s we s we do agree a date.<endOfText>
<human>Er that depends entirely on which company you go in because erm er some of the courses start at different er times.<endOfText>
<bot>If we've agreed all those three things er we also erm er recognize the need to to erm advise people or guide people on how advertising's sold.<endOfText>
<human>I see from your application form that you've sold space er for three or four years which<endOfText>
<bot>Well I have been er involved in various projects.<endOfText>
<human>Erm I had a company called  and Advertising erm where I went along to a company and would conceive promotion for them.<endOfText>
<bot>Was that your own company ?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>And I would build a package to suit their company.<endOfText>
<bot>Er if it was a double glazing company or a kitchen company I would conceive a promotion.<endOfText>
<human>Er there's one thing I was involved which er unfortunately turned out er was quite national, it was a  promotion<endOfText>
<bot>What the the disastrous one?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Er well the one I got involved with er was the free flights to er Europe<endOfText>
<human>All right.<endOfText>
<bot>which was very successful and er I was one of the instigators of that promotion.<endOfText>
<human>Er but<endOfText>
<bot>So everybody else can blame you for this  <endOfText>
<human>Well not really.<endOfText>
<bot>The the pen to paper I put the con er the package basically together with another two or three people<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>and erm it was then up to  to decide what company was going to handle the promotion.<endOfText>
<human>Er their mistake was that they chose a company which was down market and basically didn't go into er depth of that company.<endOfText>
<bot>Well that was their fault.<endOfText>
<human>The the concept of the promotion was absolutely brilliant and it could be handled from Europe<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>erm and it was so successful that they asked us again to do one from the United States<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>which we says no because it couldn't be possibly done.<endOfText>
<bot>We believed.<endOfText>
<human>Becau we thought that the  should may be too high.<endOfText>
<bot>What are you saying that you were the ori the company who were originally asked to do the<endOfText>
<human>My company was involved with er the people who put the promotion together.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>And er quite simply that if they'd left it alone on a European side because obviously you can get flight from London Gatwick for approximately forty nine pounds<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah right.<endOfText>
<human>and we presumed that the redemption would be no more than twenty percent which was pretty high for a promotion.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Erm as long as as long as the customer went through the channels and the procedures there'd no more than twenty percent.<endOfText>
<bot>So much so that we took out insurance er if it went over twenty percent we were covered.<endOfText>
<human>But then what happened it was so successful for  and I think  got so greedy on it they decided to go an American<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>er promotion.<endOfText>
<bot>But there were two separate companies who set up the the both promotions.<endOfText>
<human>So as you know the American one collapsed and of course were  thirty million pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah and there are some people are still fighting to get their er flights right <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>now aren't they?<endOfText>
<human>And I erm I had various er promotions.<endOfText>
<bot>I had er  put a promotion together with a few travel agents in Scotland where I gave out holiday spending money.<endOfText>
<human>It was quite simply we we were taking the business away from the high street erm glossy type travel agents and giving it to the back street travel agents.<endOfText>
<bot>And as long as he was prepared to give the spending money, ie in the form of a voucher, er we were taking away the market share away from etcetera of this world.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>And that worked very successfully.<endOfText>
<human>Okay this is all part of the  promotion and advertising <endOfText>
<bot>Yes <endOfText>
<human>time?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Because the rest of your er er your application form I mean er gives us a span of er twelve thirteen years in sales <endOfText>
<human>particularly in direct sales.<endOfText>
<bot>Vacuums is that vacuum<endOfText>
<human>Yes <endOfText>
<bot>cleaners?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>cleaning machine was an American machine.<endOfText>
<human>Right, yes I think I've heard of them.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Erm very successful priced basically out of the price  the market eventually.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm they're still in the market today but er you're talking about  <endOfText>
<human>Are we talking VAX type things or<endOfText>
<bot>No no.<endOfText>
<human>You're talking about a home care system.<endOfText>
<bot>That is a vacuum cleaner, that's one of the functions it does<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>but it done approximately thirty odd diff different  <endOfText>
<human>Oh well shampoo carpets okay and I suppose er er suites of furniture and things <endOfText>
<bot>I had the sales force who called in and done a demonstration in a person's home.<endOfText>
<human>All right.<endOfText>
<bot>So I had to take it from the telesales side to get the appointment to get in the door to do a demonstration and then to do the after sales.<endOfText>
<human>Right okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm<endOfText>
<human>You cut your teeth there didn't you?<endOfText>
<bot>I erm I was <endOfText>
<human>If not before.<endOfText>
<bot>I was a European top salesman with er that company and then moved on as a franchise.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>You seem to erm er you you leapfrog into erm after  into electrical appliances again?<endOfText>
<human>Er yes because obviously I was in that type of field.<endOfText>
<bot>Er I was in the market and we came out with a machine that produced lager from top tap worker.<endOfText>
<human>That's still going isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>And you just poured the water in top press a button and you get draught lager and they have now produced I believe, er it was network marketing, and I wasn't involved I didn't want involved in network marketing and it now produces gin and tonic vodka lemonade.<endOfText>
<bot>Well it's been on er consumer selling <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Very good product.<endOfText>
<human>Excellent product but er the f the network marketing is not my side and you could not direct selling.<endOfText>
<bot>All right.<endOfText>
<human>It's all done okay.<endOfText>
<bot>You had to bring someone into the business and they brought someone into the business and that was their form of selling.<endOfText>
<human>Well that's that's big business nowadays.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>In fact in the State I think twenty percent of er all products are sold through network marketing now  <endOfText>
<bot>That's right  <endOfText>
<human>In fact the Institute of Directors of which I'm a member er said er that network marketing's a thing of the future.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes definitely.<endOfText>
<human>I mean it started <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah if if you're if you're happy to get into that.<endOfText>
<human>Can cost you some money but it's er it's it's it's prefer it's preferable to er pyramid selling which of course is outlawed now.<endOfText>
<bot>The reason I went to erm  Sports<endOfText>
<human>Mhm?<endOfText>
<bot>erm which quite simply I had some money of my own and I wasn't that hungry er to jump in to any job at all.<endOfText>
<human>So I wanted to get into something I enjoyed doing.<endOfText>
<bot>And I'm a very keen golfer and I had built up a reputation erm by playing in open tour open tournaments and meeting professionals and<endOfText>
<human>Yea.<endOfText>
<bot>so I had a lot of contacts and I enjoyed it.<endOfText>
<human>Erm but it unfortunately things have not worked out with er this particular company.<endOfText>
<bot>Well no it doesn't sound by that er letter you wrote.<endOfText>
<human>I think you f you felt <endOfText>
<bot>I I have done my job.<endOfText>
<human>My targets er have been broken every month.<endOfText>
<bot>I had a hundred and twenty seven percent er sorry twenty seven percent above target er for the quarter and most of my other com my sales reps er the other sales reps in the business didn't even reach a hundred percent.<endOfText>
<human>Well how do you feel I mean a lot of a lot if not all of your work here has been done face to face.<endOfText>
<bot>Now <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>John will have told you the way we operate er we we we er we <endOfText>
<human>Telephone <endOfText>
<bot>only sell on the telephone.<endOfText>
<human>That's what people .<endOfText>
<bot>Well erm you know we've had a lot of people come to us and say we've qualified sales by telephone, I don't present that a problem with that, but we have discovered people have not listened to what we've been saying, even on the training course, when they go out there to sell the space they keep making appointments to go and see people to talk about advertising.<endOfText>
<human>That is not the game.<endOfText>
<bot>And as long as somebody realizes that that's our top people erm do that.<endOfText>
<human>They don't make appointments to go and see people.<endOfText>
<bot>What what I mean where do you see yourself fitting into that after<endOfText>
<human>If I if it was sat trying to make an appointment with you for example er and I don't know too much about the product we're just getting <endOfText>
<bot>No fine.<endOfText>
<human>Well there I mean there's the product there's <endOfText>
<bot>Well give me I'll give you an example.<endOfText>
<human>If I was phoning you from  Publishing and I phoned up G A<endOfText>
<bot>Aha.<endOfText>
<human>and I says, Good afternoon could I speak to the person that does advertising etcetera, and I get through to that particular person, and I said, How would you like to save money by us printing all your portfolios free of charge high quality er portfolios it wouldn't cost you a penny.<endOfText>
<bot>Right let me stop you there because I think you've got maybe the wrong end of the stick.<endOfText>
<human>All right.<endOfText>
<bot>We don't sell that product to anybody.<endOfText>
<human>No no you give that product away free.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay but we don't your the responsibility of the sales consultant here is not to approach the estate agent or the golf to sell that, somebody else does that.<endOfText>
<human>Oh I thought I had to get the estate agent first and then get the space .<endOfText>
<bot>No no no no we the the the assignments that are, that's why I stopped you there <endOfText>
<human>Oh I see <endOfText>
<bot>just in case there's any confusion.<endOfText>
<human>Right okay.<endOfText>
<bot>That product there already either exists or we're going to do it for the first time for an estate agent<endOfText>
<human>Right okay.<endOfText>
<bot>and that has been done by a marketing exec who goes round the country contracting with those clients.<endOfText>
<human>Oh right.<endOfText>
<bot>This is our client.<endOfText>
<human>So that's the job there.<endOfText>
<bot>That's the job for our consultant <endOfText>
<human>So okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Now let's let's say Mr Mr Plumber<endOfText>
<human>So you're you're talking to Mr Plumber and you don't even mention our company name<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>you are representing G A <endOfText>
<bot>G A <endOfText>
<human>at that er so and so<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>Er good afternoon Mr Smith I'm phoning er from G A General Property Services in such and such<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>Now you you live in the catchment area of that particular company, how would you like to er, how would you like to participating in that particular company's brochure which is handed out to all the people in your catchment area?<endOfText>
<bot>Whereas if a house is being sold your name is going to be seen on that particular product.<endOfText>
<human>All right.<endOfText>
<bot>Now I'll I'll stop you there Ron because you've got the you've got the drift of it because when we get down to deciding people come on a course then they have<endOfText>
<human>Training.<endOfText>
<bot>we we we speak for two days at least in compiling a script.<endOfText>
<human>And that script has been built up over twenty years experience.<endOfText>
<bot>But you've certainly the idea of what it is.<endOfText>
<human>Telesales er telephone erm I have sold products obviously without the customer even seeing me, I've sold them over the phone.<endOfText>
<bot>I am confident on the phone<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>and<endOfText>
<human>I don't think you'd have any problem doing this job, I'll be quite frank with you.<endOfText>
<bot>Er I<endOfText>
<human>Not with this background here.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean it's such a variety and it's involved both face to face and direct sales that er er I know I stopped you right in the middle of your spiel there.<endOfText>
<human>Now what you would say to Mr Plumber, This is this is the whole deal this is what it would cost you.<endOfText>
<bot>You see in traditional sales we don't tell people the price until the last minute.<endOfText>
<human>At that particular time I wouldn't tell them anything, all my all at that particular time is waiting for an appointment to see them.<endOfText>
<bot>Now that's what we don't do Ron.<endOfText>
<human>Oh you don't go out and see them .<endOfText>
<bot>Absolutely that's what exactly I'm asking you to listen about.<endOfText>
<human>The reason I'm asking you about that is erm I had er I had when I had my own business I was approached and we've got an estate agent in the Hamilton called   <endOfText>
<bot>Oh oh yes big one.<endOfText>
<human>And I had a phone call <endOfText>
<bot>Big one in Paisley here too.<endOfText>
<human>I had a phone call from somebody who was obviously be doing exactly the same thing, and he actually just was booking an appointment to come in and see me.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Well in fact it I would be very surprised A if he was one of ours and B if he was successful.<endOfText>
<bot>Because quite honestly we tell them absolutely everything on the phone before we we go.<endOfText>
<human>We don't make appointments and chase our tail.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>And I'll tell you from experience.<endOfText>
<bot>My first week our there I did that and I didn't earn anything.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>I got to the appoint yes come round Rod I'd like to talk to about it have a cup of coffee.<endOfText>
<human>And I just spent three quarters of an hour to an hour with him and he said, Well I've had a look at this erm, no thanks not for me.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I had wasted<endOfText>
<bot>So you phoned<endOfText>
<human>my journey there.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes all of those people would have committed on the phone to taking that advertising space.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>See why I want I wanted to be <endOfText>
<human>Yes yes <endOfText>
<bot>absolutely certain.<endOfText>
<human>Because that's exactly what traditional sales people would do including<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>this boy who'd been doing it a few years.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>So and they will te they will tell you that.<endOfText>
<bot>Now that's what the company preaches.<endOfText>
<human>There are going to be one or two occasions of course when it is likely  <endOfText>
<bot>come come round I want to I'll I want to see the product.<endOfText>
<human>In the main we tell them exactly<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>what what's going on.<endOfText>
<bot>But you you've got the drift and as long as I I persuade people to listen to the people who've been doing it for so long<endOfText>
<human>Obviously.<endOfText>
<bot>They know it's successful.<endOfText>
<human>They know that you don't make appointments and chase your tail.<endOfText>
<bot>Because one of the commitments I hope John er may have told you on the phone, one of the parts of the contract we have with G A is that they provide a list of businesses.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>That's obviously that's I would<endOfText>
<human>Yeah now that I'll come on to that in a minute.<endOfText>
<bot>But er that is is half the battle.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>On the basis that I don't think you've got any problem doing this and nor do you, you're confident enough to do this job especially with your background.<endOfText>
<human>Erm if I was to give you an option a choice of which market area you think you would be most happy with, where do you think?<endOfText>
<bot>Where is the market areas, what is the choices?<endOfText>
<human>Well the choices are estate agents and there are two companies there, that's one you're holding there and then the folders at the top.<endOfText>
<bot>There's medical practice areas, that's working in medical centres and surgeries.<endOfText>
<human>Er schools universities and colleges.<endOfText>
<bot>Area health authorities up here which we're not looking for at the moment and er because the Government is hashing them around and we're a bit uncertain in that area.<endOfText>
<human>And of course golf clubs.<endOfText>
<bot>Well golf clubs erm I mean it's a bit limited advertising in a in a market er on this particular thing to look at .<endOfText>
<human>You've got five you've got probably somewhere in the region of four thousand pounds worth of advertising there.<endOfText>
<bot>What in this?<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay so they're paying approximately what<endOfText>
<human>Nine hundred pound for a nine hundred pound for a full page.<endOfText>
<bot>Per annum.<endOfText>
<human>Per annum for two years.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>Er and you're only needing approximately two or three, you only need two or three<endOfText>
<bot>Well the fact that we've got three there, there there that's how many we got on that card and we were quite happy about that.<endOfText>
<human>But the card and the planner's sold together.<endOfText>
<bot>Right can I ask you then.<endOfText>
<human>So you're s you're saying the plan of the course er when <endOfText>
<bot>We call it planners that the yardage chart in fact.<endOfText>
<human>There's also another thing that a golf course has is a where you want a distance marker.<endOfText>
<bot>If you go along to a good quality golf course they have the score card a planner but they also have a little script that tells you about the hole.<endOfText>
<human>Well no we don't go into that.<endOfText>
<bot>That's fi quite expensive to produce.<endOfText>
<human>Right okay so <endOfText>
<bot>That's a stro that would be what you would call a stroke saver.<endOfText>
<human>We would call that, there's that and the ca and the score card.<endOfText>
<bot>So if I had if I had one course to go along and find approximately how many adverts for it?<endOfText>
<human>Well we're talking about ten.<endOfText>
<bot>Ten adverts?<endOfText>
<human>That's five five on each.<endOfText>
<bot>Er and of course nine hundred pounds to advertise.<endOfText>
<human>Well that's if they che if they all took full pages.<endOfText>
<bot>Because there're there are facilities to split the pages and there are small strips.<endOfText>
<human>If you where your hand is now if you look down the bottom, no no on the on the other side there, there are two strips.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>Two hundred and fifty pound each those are.<endOfText>
<bot>Now the question is how much can I earn for doing that<endOfText>
<human>Right well I will go into that if if that <endOfText>
<bot>If I were to make my decision obviously<endOfText>
<human>No<endOfText>
<bot>because<endOfText>
<human>Well the the same earning ability is across all those products.<endOfText>
<bot>The same earning <endOfText>
<human>Doesn't doesn't matter which company you go into you have the same er percentage, you have the same thirty percent or thirty five percent depending on how far away it is and you have the same bonus structures.<endOfText>
<bot>They all come into being at the same time.<endOfText>
<human>So whichever company or environment we agree is suitable for you.<endOfText>
<bot>Well I mean<endOfText>
<human>The natural place would be of course golf clubs.<endOfText>
<bot>But you said you were a keen golfer.<endOfText>
<human>Where do you think I see the dangers in that?<endOfText>
<bot>I'm captain of my club this year right?<endOfText>
<human>I wouldn't trust me on the golf club scene.<endOfText>
<bot>You wouldn't trust yourself?<endOfText>
<human>Why why?<endOfText>
<bot>I could kill the advertising simple.<endOfText>
<human>Probably because you would want to go and play.<endOfText>
<bot>Aha.<endOfText>
<human>Erm<endOfText>
<bot>So I'll tell you what, if we put a keen golfer out, and we have we've we've put one or two golfers,<endOfText>
<human>If I<endOfText>
<bot>if we put a keen golfer on that it's even bigger er position of trust.<endOfText>
<human>Well can I say something to you in that case then?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes sure.<endOfText>
<human>I I I visit approximately about thirty golf clubs on a weekly basis<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I have never played golf  time .<endOfText>
<bot>You haven't got time have you.<endOfText>
<human>You haven't got time.<endOfText>
<bot>Here we're talking about basing yourself for three weeks on that same golf course.<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>Doing erm two or three dozen phone calls<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>and getting nowhere and you're saying I think I'm thor thoroughly annoyed about all this<endOfText>
<human>And I'm going to get nowhere if I get on the golf course.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah that's right .<endOfText>
<human>No I don't think that worry would be there.<endOfText>
<bot>I I have to say that we we I I we just we just see that we point out to people it's an even bigger po position of trust.<endOfText>
<human>But it would be natural for me to put you in the golf club area.<endOfText>
<bot>Er well I don't think I'd be I don't think I'd be going out to play golf if I hadn't earned any money.<endOfText>
<human>That's right.<endOfText>
<bot>Er<endOfText>
<human>Well<endOfText>
<bot>I'd go hungrier.<endOfText>
<human>So are we are we talking er do you see this as a as a as a launch pad?<endOfText>
<bot>How well have you done on the golf courses?<endOfText>
<human>Well the one those since since June we're doing quite well.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>We did we've just completed  we've done three or four others.<endOfText>
<bot>But I don't I have to keep in touch of course with all companies how we're doing.<endOfText>
<human>So I don't go specifically into that.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Next question is<endOfText>
<bot>Aha?<endOfText>
<human>The golf course is no problem because you're getting it done free of charge.<endOfText>
<bot>That that's easy for you to get a golf course.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah we we have no problem with that.<endOfText>
<bot>Is that an up market golf or is it just<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Any type of golf course <endOfText>
<human>Any golf course that wants those providing they can tell us that there's erm there's going to be a useful amount of sponsorship you know er advertising available for us to approach.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>But it would be no good to them and say well you know right in the middle of nowhere, cow er sheep or cow country, there are a number of courses we wouldn't touch because we wouldn't be able to get enough sus er you know even with five erm major businesses.<endOfText>
<bot>There there I have to say there'd be very few.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Can I approach my own golf clubs or is that going to be done through you?<endOfText>
<human>No you must not do that yourself.<endOfText>
<bot>It's got to be done by you.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah if if you know of one because we we have cir you know we have circulated and we have a sales exec that goes out<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>to the courses.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm that doesn't mean to say that you can't mention it.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>But you see you will be so busy<endOfText>
<human>Just I know the topography probably better than erm <endOfText>
<bot>Oh sure.<endOfText>
<human>the person that's doing it, just er no disrespect but he's probably coming from over the border<endOfText>
<bot>No no they're all Scots people up here.<endOfText>
<human>Ah right.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>We're only having two or three up here anyway for the for the .<endOfText>
<bot>And you're saying that one golf course I could be there for two or three weeks?<endOfText>
<human>Two to three weeks.<endOfText>
<bot>We have to get off after three weeks.<endOfText>
<human>What is my earning potential in that golf course for that two or three weeks?<endOfText>
<bot>Right well I'll go through that in detail so we're talking about that.<endOfText>
<human>Okay I'll show you the details.<endOfText>
<bot>Well looking at that I wouldn't I'd like to leave it a wee while my options open because in the in the<endOfText>
<human>Sorry how d'ya how d'ya mean?<endOfText>
<bot>Because I feel there's also a possibility that in erm private private er homes etcetera there's a big market erm for producing your private.<endOfText>
<human>And in Scotland just now there's an awful lot of erm private homes open now.<endOfText>
<bot>Private residential you mean nursing<endOfText>
<human>Yes yes <endOfText>
<bot>Well that that comes under the medical side.<endOfText>
<human>Yes well that again is a<endOfText>
<bot>But you cannot do one you only do one you can't do both.<endOfText>
<human>Right okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm so I think I would be between the golf and and erm the medical side.<endOfText>
<human>Right the medical side erm we are producing medical practice booklets all right.<endOfText>
<bot>The only the only approach to residential homes and nursing homes is as advertisers in those medical books.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>What do you think in your opinion or in your experience would the best avenue be for me to follow?<endOfText>
<human>I I  I think you have an option in both.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean the advertising's more expensive in that but er erm it depends on how good you think you are.<endOfText>
<human>Well it's <endOfText>
<bot>You you know the golf<endOfText>
<human>Nine hundred pounds to me erm if it's an up market company anyway, erm nine hundred pounds for a year's advertising isn't that expensive.<endOfText>
<bot>Well it's not really.<endOfText>
<human>Not when you compare it with what they might advertise in Golf Monthly or something like that where <endOfText>
<bot>That's right.<endOfText>
<human>where they will be seen once and it's dumped.<endOfText>
<bot>That's right I mean this card is carried with them and looked at all every every basically everybody will look at that erm because the good quality <endOfText>
<human>If I was to tell you that given a perfect world that has the highest earning potential of all our companies<endOfText>
<bot>Well let's decide and look at that then.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Because er there are two there are two products.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>And remember we we resell every two years.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>And I take it erm the commission structure is just the same if I am continuing a contract on for the following year.<endOfText>
<human>Let me let me just let me get this pack out for you to take away.<endOfText>
<bot>Is this is this an area where you think you might earn some money?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>All right we can give you the we can give you the platform.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>What we have to decide here is that you think  is a is a<endOfText>
<human>I think is a very blue chip company.<endOfText>
<bot>I've look at er your own presentations.<endOfText>
<human>It's a blue chip brochure that.<endOfText>
<bot>And it's a blue chip brochure and I think obviously what I needing now after by the experience I've had with  is to get behind a company who will give me the backing.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Well there's er one thing I can tell you right now that I would not personally be involved with a company that did not have erm a backing.<endOfText>
<human>There are <endOfText>
<bot>All right.<endOfText>
<human>plenty of companies that er er this these er these can be printed by most printing companies what they don't have is the infrastructure and the backup er <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>back in head office to do that with.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>And when we when we ask people to go out we it is er a total trust self employed but they are quote employed unquote.<endOfText>
<bot>Because one things we one thing we don't have is people running other businesses alongside what we give them.<endOfText>
<human>So in other words if you're there for two to three weeks you're solidly for .<endOfText>
<bot>There isn't er er there is no, people have gone because they've been doing other things other than er .<endOfText>
<human>But it's a full time commitment.<endOfText>
<bot>As long as the earning capacity's there then  get a hundred percent.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>And that's all we ask because we'll give it a hundred percent.<endOfText>
<human>These are some samples for you to take away okay?<endOfText>
<bot>But let me show you exactly what we  I'll I'll bring in to being the list of businesses which we invite the golf club to forward to us.<endOfText>
<human>When the sales er marketing exec goes round to the golf club to sign them up in the contract with the contract we will print one or other or both.<endOfText>
<bot>The contract will state whether they have both or not.<endOfText>
<human>All right?<endOfText>
<bot>That means that if they only take the score card then you're in there fairly quickly do the advertising sales and come out and on to another site.<endOfText>
<human>So you don't expect there to be two to three weeks work there.<endOfText>
<bot>If you're doing both then of course you're you're looking to offer the options to er  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah if you can do it in a week all the better.<endOfText>
<bot>Some advertisers go on both by the way.<endOfText>
<human>They want to be on both.<endOfText>
<bot>Rod can I ask you a question?<endOfText>
<human>Yes sure.<endOfText>
<bot>How many contracts you're basing them on two to three weeks.<endOfText>
<human>Let's say that erm I was  these contracts within the first ten days.<endOfText>
<bot>How many contracts am I going to get in a year?<endOfText>
<human>Well you work it out.<endOfText>
<bot>It depends on how much time you want off.<endOfText>
<human>No how many contracts can I physically get if I want?<endOfText>
<bot>You can have as many as you want.<endOfText>
<human>The the way the company operates is that we will assign you to a golf course.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>We have in our contract that more or less we will get out after three weeks.<endOfText>
<bot>You know what whatever the situation is we we  done it by then, but er we we do they they are guaranteeing to supply us with an office and telephone facility for up to three weeks.<endOfText>
<human>Okay maximum.<endOfText>
<bot>Maximum.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm or fifteen working days.<endOfText>
<human>I mean if there are two or three days off during that or one day off you take for instance, as long as it's fifteen working days.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm and that is to do er one or the other or both.<endOfText>
<human>They might extend it if we have to do both.<endOfText>
<bot>So will you will you <endOfText>
<human>So so you can if you took if you took one week off every three assignments<endOfText>
<bot>Aha.<endOfText>
<human>all right?<endOfText>
<bot>You can work out that over a period of time you would have somewhere in the region of fifteen assignments during the year guaranteed.<endOfText>
<human>We guarantee continuity of assignment.<endOfText>
<bot>How many erm are already signed up at this present day for someone to follow on to now?<endOfText>
<human>I suppose I could only use the word tons.<endOfText>
<bot>Tons of them right.<endOfText>
<human>So there there are basically a waiting list?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>On all of our products.<endOfText>
<human>We have six hundred assignments alone on the medical side.<endOfText>
<bot>Because we're reselling.<endOfText>
<human>We haven't got to the reselling stage with these yet because we've been going about six months so the first resale is eighteen months away.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>But we've got so many new courses so worry about that er that doesn't present a problem.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm the timing for golf courses.<endOfText>
<human>Obviously these cards<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>have got to be ready for the season starting?<endOfText>
<bot>Not always.<endOfText>
<human>Er we we go in and sell the advertising if they er we'll take over as soon as the current supply runs out we we'll start offering er and supply it for them.<endOfText>
<bot>That that doesn't present a problem to us.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>More so on schools because they're closed for <endOfText>
<human>Yeah that's right.<endOfText>
<bot>the summer holidays, sometimes.<endOfText>
<human>But even that we're we have special arrangements for.<endOfText>
<bot>We don't worry about the seasonal er aspects.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>They ju er you know people hear er the sales consultants doing courses right now erm you know find that that we'll print them and we'll probably print them in in by May although they'll have needed some cards.<endOfText>
<human>So that <endOfText>
<bot>Do you give the customer unlimited supplies of these?<endOfText>
<human>Er it's agreed by the er<endOfText>
<bot>Executive that's doing it.<endOfText>
<human>by the by the er s the sa sales the marketing executive and the golf club agreed a number.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>All right?<endOfText>
<bot>We will know somewhere how much we need definitely  <endOfText>
<human>To print <endOfText>
<bot>to make sure of the print.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Because the second year where no costs come out of the second year's er payment that's our that's where we make our money.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>The first year we<endOfText>
<human>Because the plates have already been set up etcetera etcetera .<endOfText>
<bot>Absolutely yes.<endOfText>
<human>All the costs your commissions marketing executive's commission right.<endOfText>
<bot>Now we ask er the club to supply er in between us signing them up for to to do the cards to them to the consultant erm er getting there getting there to do the assignment could be five or six months.<endOfText>
<human>We don't you know we've got clubs still waiting that we signed up last year.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>Er we we make that quite plain to them all right that there might be a delay.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>All right until their number comes up as it were.<endOfText>
<bot>Er in the meantime we we leave them erm er a list or a a sheet like or something similar to this, I haven't got one for  at the moment, erm asking them to list out all those business with which they have some er may be some link up.<endOfText>
<human>You just have to look round a lot of trophy cabinets and you can see a lot of locally sponsored cups and trophies in there.<endOfText>
<bot>Plus a lot a members have their own business.<endOfText>
<human>Plus plus yes and especially if if I went, we went to  and I think it was er from the membership.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>I would imagine a lot of it could be.<endOfText>
<bot>And these are very typical er advertisers and erm, whether you agree with it or not, these are.<endOfText>
<human>Whoever supplies the bar.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>It may be this any of the suppliers.<endOfText>
<bot>So there's a lot of scope a lot more scope on these to be more direct because they're quality ads and they're quality product.<endOfText>
<human>My particular er my particular club has about approximately thirty businessmen in various varying from double glazing kitchens<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>What what a what prestige.<endOfText>
<bot>who would love to be involved in their own club .<endOfText>
<human>Absolutely yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Absolutely.<endOfText>
<human>So we've you know that's why I believe that this is this is gonna be our real launch pad for the future.<endOfText>
<bot>This will be easy for me.<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>Put that in quotes will you?.<endOfText>
<human>I I mean <endOfText>
<bot>I well if you've got that confidence fine.<endOfText>
<human>And and when that when the when the assignment comes up when Ron  is assigned to X club wherever that is erm that will be the sheet the sheet will be provided<endOfText>
<bot>For me?<endOfText>
<human>for you to work on.<endOfText>
<bot>Now one of the most important things that we've established erm is that er you need to sit down still with the secretary of the club and say right now you've got this list of businesses tell me more about them.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>It's not simple<endOfText>
<human>You should not just say, oh there's good I'll phone him now because you need some valuable information.<endOfText>
<bot>So we make, but all that is is tau is is is<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>directed on the course.<endOfText>
<human>So that's going to be very useful and you will get information about all these firms it could be that member has already been advised and he's willing.<endOfText>
<bot>Could be little notes here already notified us that he's happy to go on <endOfText>
<human>He wants to go ahead with it.<endOfText>
<bot>He wants to go ahead.<endOfText>
<human>Wonderful.<endOfText>
<bot>That's how quickly you can you can speed up the operation.<endOfText>
<human>Erm now to to give you and there would be other details by the way er other er information concerning that assignment like how many cards we're printing like what the target is.<endOfText>
<bot>The average target across all of our products is somewhere in the region of six thousand.<endOfText>
<human>But I'm going to show you a bit more detail for .<endOfText>
<bot>First of all let's give you an idea of what the the prices are, we've talked about prices.<endOfText>
<human>Now we talk full pages most of the time.<endOfText>
<bot>If we can get full pages fine but sometimes it's better for us to get these.<endOfText>
<human>It could be that there's more money avail <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>You can you can work that out for yourself.<endOfText>
<human>But erm a full cover is nine hundred pounds full front cover.<endOfText>
<bot>Now what happens there some some, particularly motor companies, will ask permission if they can put some cars in front of the club house if there's a photograph of the clubhouse and have them photographed.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>That's considered to be a full page.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>Full front cover.<endOfText>
<human>Now some clubs are quite happy for an ad to be there and for the golf club name to be there.<endOfText>
<bot>It <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>really depends on the choice of <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>the individual.<endOfText>
<human>That and then front cover strip down the bottom here that one there is six hundred pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>So that you can you can see there's a a some options here.<endOfText>
<human>My mention on the planner that the strips oops those strips, all these prices are identified here and when you take this away you can have a look at it.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay?<endOfText>
<human>Erm and er there you will see how the the volume is made up.<endOfText>
<bot>If you have filled all the spaces available those are the two totals.<endOfText>
<human>You're looking for five thousand three hundred and eighty<endOfText>
<bot>And four thousand seven hundred and sixty.<endOfText>
<human>Let's have a look which is more important to you.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's have a look at how your money is made up.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Score card has always a target of four thousand pound.<endOfText>
<human>Now that's an internal target for us to work on and for you to to have fixed in your mind because everything above four thousand pound you will get forty five percent commission instead of thirty.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>And that's made up of thirty percent and tha that's the total revenue you can get on, sell all that card and that's the total revenue you can get.<endOfText>
<human>Thirty percent of that equals that<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>the bonuses will be or the bonus will be that and your total on the card therefore is eighteen twenty one.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>If you're doing the planner at the same time thirty percent and that's the that's the total amount you can get on a planner, but the target there is thirty two hundred.<endOfText>
<bot>That target is really star is for the the bonus purposes.<endOfText>
<human>In other words after that we start paying another fifteen percent.<endOfText>
<bot>What's the percentage for er both doing the score card and the course planner for a cou er a golf course?<endOfText>
<human>Well you would treat them as a separate entity.<endOfText>
<bot>You you mean in terms of bonus or?<endOfText>
<human>No what is the percentage-wise of taking both er the the golf course when both done ?<endOfText>
<bot>I I I can't answer that I really don't know.<endOfText>
<human>Because it's there's if I'm there for three weeks and they only want a score card done then my potential earnings er total earnings are that but I'm there anyway so if I'm getting both of them done then I can earn a lot more money.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh you can earn a lot more money certainly.<endOfText>
<human>But you'll you'll if you're only doing the card you'll do that much quicker .<endOfText>
<bot>Yes and then <endOfText>
<human>And then you're straight on to the next job .<endOfText>
<bot>I'd be out of the door quicker.<endOfText>
<human>You'd be out of the door quicker.<endOfText>
<bot>So it's it is swings and roundabouts there.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>If you're doing both then that's your total income and if you did that in three weeks I would think you'd be very happy with that.<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Er<endOfText>
<human>That's a thousand pound or plus a week.<endOfText>
<bot>Yep.<endOfText>
<human>Erm <endOfText>
<bot>And I believe that with with your background and knowledge then sure that that's achievable.<endOfText>
<human>I wouldn't I would like to think I could .<endOfText>
<bot>Because if that if you had if you had a perfect year it is that.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>Then of course if you want to take time off and things like that.<endOfText>
<human>I'm being honest er Rod if I can earn myself twenty five thirty thousand I'm not I'm not looking for you know fortunes.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm looking for a decent income with the right company.<endOfText>
<human>Right well you twenty five thousand a year is about the minimum the company er you wouldn't be doing the job if you were below that.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean net I mean net.<endOfText>
<human>I  tax <endOfText>
<bot>Okay right .<endOfText>
<human>In that case you're looking for thirty five thirty six thousand which would be mister average in our company.<endOfText>
<bot>Right okay.<endOfText>
<human>I don't want to be mister average so we'll go for the fifty five.<endOfText>
<bot>We'll go for the fifty five.<endOfText>
<human>Well if you have that attitude then you'll do it.<endOfText>
<bot>We'll go for it.<endOfText>
<human>All right.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay well that's erm every assignment to you you always have and this is being this had been updated we haven't got the new one yet but you will have what we call a blank.<endOfText>
<human>And you will go around er using this to show people well I've sold that and that's mister so and so or that's such and such business that's gone so that you can show people that you've actually sold these.<endOfText>
<bot>In other words that's your work horse.<endOfText>
<human>Can I can I honestly make a suggestion?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean there's<endOfText>
<human>Well if it's to do with anything you've seen here please make it in the right quarters not  at me .<endOfText>
<bot>No the suggestion is we're in the golf club and we're doing a planner we're not doing a score card<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>and I know it's not erm your business to be doing tee markers  <endOfText>
<human>Plea please can I ask you if you bring in any other ideas of business you'll be considered to be<endOfText>
<bot>No I'm talking about the company doing it.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah yeah but forget it for now.<endOfText>
<bot>Right okay.<endOfText>
<human>They are not of any interest to us.<endOfText>
<bot>They are they do not they're not printed.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>But they would be printed.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah but they're not they're not part of our range now.<endOfText>
<bot>Because if you start getting if you get bogged down with discussing people about other products they'll think you're either gonna be doing them<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>as a side<endOfText>
<human>It's some once as a customer you can do it later stage.<endOfText>
<bot>All right.<endOfText>
<human>Because you start talking too many other businesses, and this is a bit of advice for you<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>if you start talking any other business about wha except what you're doing there then they'll think that you're doing that as an as a side.<endOfText>
<bot>And they'll take they'll take everything away from you no messing around.<endOfText>
<human>are very strict on that.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh no no no no there are no intentions whatsoever the only thought was that er if you're into that type of advertising there's another eighteen spaces for the company.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>We're not into that advertising.<endOfText>
<human>There are plenty of other companies doing that.<endOfText>
<bot>Is there?<endOfText>
<human>But we are only interested in this particular product.<endOfText>
<bot>Right okay .<endOfText>
<human>Okay .<endOfText>
<bot>This is this is fairly new to us we bought the company because it was doing exactly what we were doing on other products.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>But we are not interested at this stage in tee markers and if you keep mentioning them Ron they'll think hello <endOfText>
<human>Well could could you tell me er how many <endOfText>
<bot>Sorry that's just a bit of advice  <endOfText>
<human>That's that's no problem I thought it was just erm a thought for yourself maybe you could give out .<endOfText>
<bot>Oh oh they they will have in fact the guy who's who owned this company who's now general manager of the company within the group<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>erm has been has had his erm er his feelers out for all sorts of advertising.<endOfText>
<human>Because even tee markers is not the end of the story.<endOfText>
<bot>Where is the golf company based?<endOfText>
<human>There're all based at  head office.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>But you work from the clients premises at all at all times.<endOfText>
<bot>Will that be in Scotland?<endOfText>
<human>Well it's in it it we have enough assignments up here to consider that that's probably right.<endOfText>
<bot>But we've just had somebody from Glasgow go down to do my own course in Humberside.<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>Now that was er er more or less a favour to me.<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>But er what we say is that we will pay thirty percent up to a hundred miles away from home<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>okay above that we will pay thirty five percent.<endOfText>
<human>And that's one way by the way not a fifty mile round trip and all we say to everybody whichever company they go into, we say to everybody who sits in your position there <endOfText>
<bot>Can I refuse an assignment then?<endOfText>
<human>You can discuss an assignment.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>But if that's your only opportunity to earn money that week<endOfText>
<bot>Obviously then I'm going to take that<endOfText>
<human>or that time, you'll take it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Erm the guy down who's just done my my club earned himself eighteen hundred pound in one week and he paid about a hundred a twenty quid out for bed and breakfast.<endOfText>
<bot>And probably forty pounds worth of of petrol there and back.<endOfText>
<human>So his expenses are his own.<endOfText>
<bot>Aha.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>But if we were to send people consistently Glasgow to Humberside I don't think we'd have them very long.<endOfText>
<human>And there are enough golf courses up in Scotland.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>And that that guy has just been transferred to another group so you know we're now one short well in fact we're three or four short up in Scotland so.<endOfText>
<bot>How many people er in this particular erm assignment would you have in Scotland, just the one off?<endOfText>
<human>Aha.<endOfText>
<bot>At the moment.<endOfText>
<human>That's why I'm very keen about to get about four up here because that means at the moment we've got several several golf clubs waiting.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>Quite a number in fact.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>Because this is a the hive of the golf club industry.<endOfText>
<bot>So those are the if you like the financial details and any any questions you have about that then er<endOfText>
<human>No I'm I'm very happy with<endOfText>
<bot>In terms of paying commissions we pay them all the following week.<endOfText>
<human>I think John will have told you that.<endOfText>
<bot>And certainly we have kept the amou the amount of administration down to a bear minimum if I can show you.<endOfText>
<human>We have the same contract for all of our products whichever company the only difference is that they're slightly colour coded.<endOfText>
<bot>If you're colour blind tough.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>All right they're colour coded.<endOfText>
<human>Er there's not a  one there yet.<endOfText>
<bot>And what we in fact the the reason we tell people everything on the phone Ron is that there are some things that  pen I did have one here,<endOfText>
<human>Here you go.<endOfText>
<bot>that's all right no I've got one over here somewhere  <endOfText>
<human>It's some day it's turned out.<endOfText>
<bot>Wow I think we'll get that on the tape recorder.<endOfText>
<human>The things that we make sure people know before we get there is the price all right, I've already mentioned that.<endOfText>
<bot>The fact that we need a thirty five percent deposit cheque.<endOfText>
<human>The fact that er we take the balance of the first year's payment through a banker's order.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>If you don't tell them about the deposit cheque if you don't tell them about the banker's order they will say, Well just a minute Ron you didn't tell me that on the phone.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't deal with<endOfText>
<human>I like the idea of thirty five percent up front and  <endOfText>
<bot>Well well that's the only way we can pay you your money then the following week.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>Because in fact when you go to a client you're picking up your own deposit cheque.<endOfText>
<human>It will be made out to us and we pay you the following week.<endOfText>
<bot>Is this a two year contract?<endOfText>
<human>It is and wherever you quote nine hundred pound you quote them nine hundred pound per year <endOfText>
<bot>Per annum.<endOfText>
<human>for a minimum of two years.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>Even though the cards are reprinted every year it's it's still<endOfText>
<bot>So you really need some sound businesses you don't need your<endOfText>
<human>You don't need your penny <endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>You will not get your local er plumber er on these.<endOfText>
<bot>You're looking for high fliers and even car firms can go bust the second year .<endOfText>
<human>track record <endOfText>
<bot>So you have to tell people all about.<endOfText>
<human>Hello  I wonder if you'd mind asking him to wait and I'll er be with him in about ten minutes.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh can you offer him a coffee?<endOfText>
<human>Please thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Yep you need some sound businesses<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>there's no doubt about it.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm and they will want the prestige of being on the golf club and quite honestly, the golf club card, and quite honestly so does the golf club want<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>prestigious.<endOfText>
<human>That's why their list will be erm if you like pre-vetoed you know.<endOfText>
<bot>They have they have the right of veto on whoever goes on there.<endOfText>
<human>However it's in their interests of course to allow you to get on and do your job.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>But if you don't tell them about things like banker's order about the signature, particularly if two s two erm signatures are wanted on the cheque and the banker's order, if the other guy's not there you don't go round until he's available.<endOfText>
<bot>Of course.<endOfText>
<human>If you've left that contract with them you'd never see it again.<endOfText>
<bot>The other aspects of erm that's the contract you've already got the contract and the cheque.<endOfText>
<human>The other thing that we want from the client advertising client to make it a full deal so that we can pay you the thirty thirty percent commission is copy.<endOfText>
<bot>Now this is the only product we have where it's full four colour.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>So it's very important to know before you go round if if they've got copy.<endOfText>
<human>You say that I need to discuss copy when I've got there if you've got copy if they've had full colour before then they will have bromides and separations and things like <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>that.<endOfText>
<bot>They will probably be using an agency.<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>And at the training school Ron they will tell you exactly how we deal with those.<endOfText>
<human>Yes okay.<endOfText>
<bot>There is a form which once again will exp be explained at the er on the training course.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>But that's the form.<endOfText>
<human>If they've never advertised before which is unlikely if we're going for high fli you know high flier <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>companies, that's the space down there.<endOfText>
<bot>But I'm not going to er sit here teach you or show you how to do that because that's the training course responsibility.<endOfText>
<human>This is probably the most important form.<endOfText>
<bot>And that is the commission form.<endOfText>
<human>All right.<endOfText>
<bot>We c there once again all of these forms are colour coded, there's your  one.<endOfText>
<human>All right so you can see that they're the same form.<endOfText>
<bot>Advertising position the advertiser this will be the golf club that will be the town full and approved contract of what I've just described.<endOfText>
<human>There are a number of companies that we have across our erm all of our products which are what we call approved.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>And in fact you will have seen on those cards over there a BUPA hospital.<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>Those are covered by a special arrangement where we don't have to collect a cheque we don't have a banker's order but it's done through a erm a company invoice<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>All right.<endOfText>
<bot>The difference there is instead of the cheque and the banker's order you have to pick up an official order from the BUPA hospital.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>And BUPA hospitals, although they're very common of course on the medical side are are going to be obviously popular on the golf club side.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>They're going to be popular on the golf club?<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes.<endOfText>
<bot>There's one if you pick up one there I think one of those cards there has got one on the planner and one on the erm<endOfText>
<human>Oh yes I see yes yes.<endOfText>
<bot>One thing about advertising Ron is er is the danger of prejudging who will and who will not come into our product.<endOfText>
<human>And we've we've proven that er some people have said, Oh well he won't come on he can't either afford it or he doesn't want to.<endOfText>
<bot>And we've turned it round.<endOfText>
<human>I've found that many times in  sales .<endOfText>
<bot>Okay now erm the only question mark we have at the moment Ron is the car.<endOfText>
<human>Question mark for me or the car?<endOfText>
<bot>Well if you can give me some reassurance <endOfText>
<human>Oh no no problem.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>I mean<endOfText>
<bot>Right because I have to put that on my notes you see and I <endOfText>
<human>I the car I had before I gave up the company car was a Mercedes Sports S L<endOfText>
<bot>Oh right.<endOfText>
<human>But I'm not to obviously going to buy a Mercedes Sports S L necessarily at this stage.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>All we all we say we need<endOfText>
<bot>Is a reasonable<endOfText>
<human>I a bit worried about my pen.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Erm right well when you've got on your form here on your er you need to give a couple of week's notice .<endOfText>
<bot>Well what what I'm looking for there Rod obviously is a response to this letter I have sent to .<endOfText>
<human>If they don't respond to me in the next forty eight hours I'm going to send them a second letter er tel .<endOfText>
<bot>Basically what I am doing is I want them to reply.<endOfText>
<human>I have only written the truth in my letter to them.<endOfText>
<bot>They have got to respond to it.<endOfText>
<human>All right.<endOfText>
<bot>Er and if <endOfText>
<human>I mean what happens if they they give you everything you want and er <endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>No I will not want for this company again.<endOfText>
<bot>All right.<endOfText>
<human>I am out of.<endOfText>
<bot>Doesn't matter what  <endOfText>
<human>Well the way you've approached it there I guess you're not going to be er sales director<endOfText>
<bot>It's not it's not the point of the money it's the fact is that they've lied to me erm and really I want =em .<endOfText>
<human>What actually happened was my a friend of mine or really was a friend of mine for a short time, he he was in the company when I joined, and er after two months he told me he was leaving.<endOfText>
<bot>And I said why are you leaving?<endOfText>
<human>Because I hadn't experienced all this<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>and he's Ron you're going to experience a lot of things that you're not going be happy about he says but I'll let you find out for yourself.<endOfText>
<bot>Well may be you shouldn't have done if he was a  friend .<endOfText>
<human>So he left.<endOfText>
<bot>Suddenly he got another job in the golf industry and he left.<endOfText>
<human>And when he he was told to bring in his car the next day and his company stock.<endOfText>
<bot>He says no problem.<endOfText>
<human>He went down to his car and down to his company stock and he says now what the money's due to me you'll get them in the post.<endOfText>
<bot>And he says they told him to get out the building<endOfText>
<human>Mhm.<endOfText>
<bot>and give him a rough time and he was the longest serving rep with .<endOfText>
<human>Well of course I mean the the point there is <endOfText>
<bot>you get you get your money first before you hand over your car and the stock.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Now this is what happened.<endOfText>
<human>They sent him away and he's waited four months and he has not had a penny.<endOfText>
<bot>He's written to them numerous times and they say what money.<endOfText>
<human>All right.<endOfText>
<bot>So he is now in a position he can either take them to court or he's forgetting it.<endOfText>
<human>Because he's still in the golf industry he's forgetting it.<endOfText>
<bot>Now it's something like eighteen hundred pounds.<endOfText>
<human>Now what I want to do is I want them to respond first.<endOfText>
<bot>If they don't respond I will say the next letter will be, okay I am now resigning and your car and your stock won't be returned to you er but I'm holding them in lieu.<endOfText>
<human>Yes okay <endOfText>
<bot>towards money due to me.<endOfText>
<human>What but what what we're talking about timing here because we won't we won't er we won't for ever and ever you see .<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>Can I say definite I'd be quite happy to start within the next four weeks.<endOfText>
<bot>Er four weeks from now.<endOfText>
<human>Or <endOfText>
<bot>Well <endOfText>
<human>is that too far away?<endOfText>
<bot>Well let me just er just check on when the<endOfText>
<human>the course is.<endOfText>
<bot>the course is.<endOfText>
<human>Well let's say I'd be ready for your for your next course if it's not till  .<endOfText>
<bot>Okay well there's a course running next week so we know that's out.<endOfText>
<human>The next one is the fourteenth of February.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>I'd be happy going the fourteenth of February .<endOfText>
<bot>Okay but that if you delay it's two weeks.<endOfText>
<human>Because they're held every two weeks here, whereas the rest of the companies are every week.<endOfText>
<bot>So you get the fourteenth and then the following one is the twenty eighth February?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>And this is now well .<endOfText>
<human>Well can I say can I say definitely Rod I will I will go on if accepted on the twenty eighth of February.<endOfText>
<bot>Can I say that for definite?<endOfText>
<human>All right.<endOfText>
<bot>Now <endOfText>
<human>Just in case they hold me to a four week<endOfText>

<human>I says well you'll need to cancel it because they send an appointment to that person.<endOfText>
<bot>We will be charged for it, even if they don't attend.<endOfText>
<human>That's right, that's what I thought.<endOfText>

<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>thanks very much.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay John.<endOfText>
<human>Cheerio now.<endOfText>
<bot>Cheerio.<endOfText>
<human><endOfText>
<bot>Those people who have the record sheets from last week, ten, ten people that are doing work for the British National Corpus.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, could you just put your hands up if you're doing recording for Corpus.<endOfText>
<bot>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, who's the tenth?<endOfText>
<human>You're all sharing  so who's, who's got their partners ?<endOfText>
<bot>We've got all partners here <endOfText>
<human>So, who hasn't got their partner here?<endOfText>
<bot>So only nine people with their hands up.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, Jill, erm,<endOfText>
<bot>There're going to be ten of you.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, are you happily doing it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>I've got some more of these sheets if anybody wants them  There are a lot of them on my door, and not very many of them are taken away.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, so, if they are on my door.<endOfText>
<bot>They've been on my door since late <endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>If you want more of these <endOfText>
<human>difficult.<endOfText>
<bot>Really got to define what  mm.<endOfText>
<human>actual and description from different you know different conversations  to one complication.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, I'm just about to give you an assignment sheet, those ten people.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, and actually formalize the assignment, so people will see what you've got to do, if the others will bear with me for a minute or two.<endOfText>
<bot>But before I give you the assignment sheet, erm, how are you getting on?<endOfText>
<human>Are there any, erm, unforeseen, erm, problems?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah <endOfText>
<human>It's more difficult than I thought actually.<endOfText>
<bot>About background, like with most people, there's always something on in the background <endOfText>
<human>conversations  <endOfText>
<bot>like the radio, T V and it muffles it all out.<endOfText>
<human>So.<endOfText>
<bot>Got to try and talk without the T V on.<endOfText>
<human>So th the problems were acoustics,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>rather than problems with remem remembering the tape recorder which  comes out, it<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>actually  so don't let's feel you haven't coped.<endOfText>
<bot>Any other problems?<endOfText>
<human>Has, has anybody <endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>How do you all like, if you tell people, you know, without causing offence, do you normally tell people after you've done it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And no doubt, everyone said fine.<endOfText>
<bot>Has it been <endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>by the time you've taped something, it's done.<endOfText>
<human>Few.<endOfText>
<bot>Helen.<endOfText>
<human>I'm still on my first one, actually<endOfText>
<bot>Tape one of two.<endOfText>
<human>Two.<endOfText>
<bot>Got one.<endOfText>
<human>One, yes, right.<endOfText>
<bot>So you will obviously erm, if you can, try and do a bit more, because this time next week we're into  back.<endOfText>
<human>Next Friday morning, I think you were all here when we were planning this, but just to remind you, next Friday morning, erm, somebody else is coming from the team in Harlow.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't  know if it will be the same person.<endOfText>
<human>To talk about transcription, and we will run that on a workshop basis, I hope.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll try and look to sort of student access   erm, total theoretical  will have, erm, some of your own transcripts by then.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, so could you all, including those people who aren't working on this project, bring erm, one of your tapes, because you're all taping the assignment, anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>You may not have got round to doing it yet, but bring something next week.<endOfText>
<human>A a tape, and B a short piece of transcription.<endOfText>
<bot>It may not be the bit that you're going to eventually use for your assignment, because you're a bit unsure  taped up your assignment, but bring a short transcription, at least one side of A four, because if you do that, you will, if you've given yourself a chance of actually trying it out, you will begin to see the problems and  and the whole thing will be much more interesting and more rewardable.<endOfText>
<human>If I'm boring this time, you haven't tried it, but if you, if you can do it then erm, it'll be a really interesting session, of sort of getting together in groups and discussing the problems and sorting ways out of problems.<endOfText>
<bot>So let's be free  at least one tape erm, at least, at least one side  based on the tape.<endOfText>
<human>And have your tape wound to the place that you've transcribed, so that, if necessary you will be ready to replay the bit that you can't transcribe it, to the others, or to one of us, erm, to explain why you can't do it.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, we won't say too much about transcription systems at the moment, erm, just do, do it according to what you think are the most important bits to get down onto paper.<endOfText>
<human>When you're trying to write down speech, you can see that there are all sorts of problems initially, of how much you write down.<endOfText>
<bot>And, all of you will probably make different choices.<endOfText>
<human>Do you write down, for example, the pauses, and if you write the pauses, do you try and write how long they are?<endOfText>
<bot>And what, erm, decided you to use the pauses.<endOfText>
<human>Do you try and write down hesitations?<endOfText>
<bot>And if so, how do you write them down, what, what, how do you spell a hesitation?<endOfText>
<human>The ers and the erms.<endOfText>
<bot>How do you  spell that ?<endOfText>
<human>Do you want  spelling for all hesi hesitations,ju ju ju just to show that somebody's hesitated?<endOfText>
<bot>Or do you want to show exactly how they've hesitated?<endOfText>
<human>All these sorts of things are going to be the sorts of things that we'll bring up in discussion, but you won't realize what the problems are until you tried doing it.<endOfText>
<bot>Today we're going to try <endOfText>
<human>Has anybody actually found  writing it all out because as soon as you do, you'll be faced with hundreds of choices.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you just do it like a school dictation in French, writing down the words, with conventional punctuation.<endOfText>
<human>Full stops at the end.<endOfText>
<bot>Or do you try and put in all these extra things like pauses, hesitations, intonation,<endOfText>
<human>rhythm, stress  you can go on, getting so detailed, that it, as St Steve said last week, you can spend sort of half an hour on half a sentence, if you put it, if you try to put in everything.<endOfText>
<bot>That's obviously unprincipled.<endOfText>
<human>So you got the whole spectrum of, or if you're just doing it like French dictation, it won't, if words tend to just, to just be spoken language, right through to an immensely detailed erm, attempts to put everything down, including tone of the voice, and all these other ones which are extremely difficult to   I think you noticed that I was standing looking at the transcriptions  near each team.<endOfText>
<bot>And you listen to the voices.<endOfText>
<human>If you read the transcription first, there is only a very small proportion of the actual information get right to the .<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, totally missing, really is the voice quality, which is a, one of the main ways in which we judge somebody's character, isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>And, so would you want to put some more of that in, and erm  all these, all these things, as I've said, will help you to, to speak.<endOfText>
<bot>So, everybody you're looking at.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Sorry, what about, erm, so people have been taping,th actually it's ten people.<endOfText>
<human>Mm <endOfText>
<bot>Erm, you've apparent problems of lack of clarity, well that's absolutely normal erm, but they've built into the system.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, what, erm, also  you haven't had a problem with being rejected.<endOfText>
<bot>Have, have you had a problem of remembering to turn it on, remembering the batteries  <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>It's quite difficult to tell how much tape's gone, if you got  that much tape left, you think you can get more conversation on and you can't.<endOfText>
<human>It's difficult to judge the  especially when the person that you  for by someone just popping round and picking something up and they stay for ages,and they didn't know I was taping and then  something clicked up in the middle of it.<endOfText>
<bot>But I mean I lost half the conversation, they wondered what was going on.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, it would have been quite useful to have given that tape as some indication on that little diagram on the tape recorder, about a minute or, they're all standard tape recorders, how much measure, how much is it in terms of time, a minute of your tape is ten minutes <endOfText>
<human>And also of course, a, a, a problem that you can't solve is, you never know in advance how long a conversation's going to be.<endOfText>
<bot>Can you?<endOfText>
<human>So you may think you've half a tape left, which is, should be <endOfText>
<bot>Fifteen minutes.<endOfText>
<human>No, forty five minutes.<endOfText>
<bot>Forty five each side.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, even if you know how much time you've got left, you never  how long they're going to talk for.<endOfText>
<bot>I think they're bound to respond to that, I mean, as you turn it over and keep going on.<endOfText>
<human>So that's cer certainly a problem.<endOfText>
<bot>Any other things that we can, perhaps solve?<endOfText>
<human>So it's easier than  you said it's more difficult than if you want to get clear recordings.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, somebody said that, it's alright now, though.<endOfText>
<human>That's, well, that's good, well, there aren't any other problems that we need to talk about now.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, good.<endOfText>
<human>got something <endOfText>
<bot>Was it, were you there when erm, Steve  was saying that he would leave behind with me a recorder's  programme.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, tell me if I'm repeating it, because I have said it to a couple of other groups I know, especially the Wednesday group.<endOfText>
<human>So tell me if I've told you this before.<endOfText>
<bot>That he did leave behind a after lunch, when you, after you'd gone, a couple of very useful disks.<endOfText>
<human>One was the disk erm, which actually held about  erm, three hours' worth of conversations straight from the corpus er banking, er composition.<endOfText>
<bot>So that we have got a disk which we can put into the machines down there in the computer room, a whole lot of transcriptions that they've already made.<endOfText>
<human>They are all based round one person, one speaker, somebody called Fred .<endOfText>
<bot>He lives in Croydon, erm, he's old, so we've got quite a lot of  conversation.<endOfText>
<human>I think he's seventy five, he's retired.<endOfText>
<bot>But you got conversation with him and his family  two generations of his family at his house perhaps in Croydon.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, with his brother I think from Hemel Hempstead, erm, and a lot of pub conversations, in a pub called The Lion in Croydon, with erm, I think it must be an ex-girlfriend.<endOfText>
<bot>It's quite suggestive kind of conversations, especially for a seventy five year old.<endOfText>
<human>Quite suggestive .<endOfText>
<bot>And, and, it's all very very spontaneous and really quite quite nicely done.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, when I really learnt to use this myself, in the computer room   go along there for, half an hour one Friday, and have a look at it, because you might, in your second assignment possibly like to, to use this data in some way.<endOfText>
<bot>Look at it.<endOfText>
<human>I've got transcriptions, I've got printouts as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, but use it in order to look at ready made conversations in order to collect .<endOfText>
<human>So you can get these conversations up on computer screen, all of them, and you can pick them out .<endOfText>
<bot>Well, that doesn't sound too exciting, because basically you're ending up with transcripts, well, ready made transcripts.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, but as I say it's a good thing that you're doing yourselves.<endOfText>
<bot>Just more of the same.<endOfText>
<human>The interest on this, is that he also left a second disk.<endOfText>
<bot>And that is, now did he mention that or didn't he, or did I  because .<endOfText>
<human>Do you know what ?<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, well, this is the interesting thing, in a way, that bring, you might, very well like to go and play with them in the computer room.<endOfText>
<human>Some time, anyway,set my work.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, you, this is the second program, it's relative with the conversations, and relative with the recording  as well.<endOfText>
<human>Well it can access all the words, er, on the disks.<endOfText>
<bot>So if you wanted to look for example, at hesitations, and try to do an analysis of where he had hesitated and why he hesitated, who hesitates more than others.<endOfText>
<human>Just to take an example.<endOfText>
<bot>You type it on your computer, erm, say er, or erm, or other hesitation markers, that you will predict will mark hesitation, and on your scr you type this on the keyboard, and on your screen, you will get a whole list of  places where this is used with the beginning bit of the sentence, and the end bit of the sentence, and all the ers will be listed down the middle of the screen, with the line numbers, here, so you can check back to where it comes from.<endOfText>
<human>So that you may find that all the hesitations are by women, or most of them by women, or most of them are in the pub, or most of them are a after ten at night, or ar you know, you can look at the context in which certain words, certain conversational gambits that some of them use.<endOfText>
<bot>And it's a very quick and very interesting,by comparing data  and looking at what you've got.<endOfText>
<human>Because obviously you could do this by hand, you could do it by  it took ages and could be very boring.<endOfText>
<bot>You can get it spaced up on the screen, and you can print it out.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, I don't know whether you can think of any other words that would be use useful but erm, if you weren't looking at hesitations, you might look at erm,<endOfText>
<bot>Perhaps use the first names and put out the meaning of the first names of the <endOfText>
<human>Yes, that would be quite interesting, wouldn't it, when we talked about some forms of address.<endOfText>
<bot>Wait, I've got an instant who's taking part in the conversations and you could type in the first names of those people and then again you'll get back some why the use of the first name.<endOfText>
<human>Which would surround the context and you'd be able to see when people, the real  first names.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, perhaps those aren't very  of examples, but, I think you can see, that there are enormous scope for erm, looking at a large amount of language.<endOfText>
<human>They're very economical, and very interesting way of .<endOfText>
<bot>So as I say,when I've got erm, actually to know  how these  reference disks work, then I'll be able to use them and talk.<endOfText>
<human>We will then look at  thousand and one bits and see what effect and follow that up.<endOfText>
<bot>And next year's student, or even next term's, perhaps, depending on how quick you do it, your conversations, what you're doing now, once they're transcribed and put onto disk would be very interesting, because we'll have a disk from our St Mary's  students, transcribed, because Steve promised he would get them all transcribed.<endOfText>
<human>And they would go on disk <endOfText>
<bot>And  but he can get them on to a disk.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, God, don't want mine on a disk.<endOfText>
<bot>Well,if you don't want them on, that's the whole problems of  obviously saying, erm, in fact, we don't, if we don't want them on a disk at all, we don't have to have them.<endOfText>
<human>But I think this would be a very useful, erm, useful thing, because we'll have all your conversations on a disk and we'll be able to record and explain too, looking at typical seminars<endOfText>
<bot>erm, and all the other contexts and situations that you've recorded.<endOfText>
<human>Don't forget that when it's transcribed, when it's professionally transcribed, all the names will be changed, so you'll all be anonymous.<endOfText>
<bot>That's part of the system.<endOfText>
<human>They, they shouldn't be erm, identifiable, because the names and the addresses, telephone numbers, anything that helps you to identify an individual, will be changed.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, but, but think that out, because the, your reaction then was interesting.<endOfText>
<human>Perhaps in a way, if you feel that it's going to be too revealing to have this   <endOfText>
<bot>Don't they keep <endOfText>
<human>We, we needn't do it, it just seems to me that it would be  <endOfText>
<bot>Like with the names  do they the  personal?<endOfText>
<human>Names were changed,to protect the innocent.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, all the names would be changed, all the, all the names will be changed, automatically.<endOfText>
<human>He said that that's part of the transcription system.<endOfText>
<bot>So in fact, erm, on the disk that we've already got Fred isn't really Fred it's Char it's a substituted name.<endOfText>
<human>Unless you name drop in the conversation, that's the only  thing that might be a bit revealing.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>What do you mean, if you refer to somebody?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Well, that would also be changed.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, really <endOfText>
<human>All, all proper names with capital letters, would be changed for <endOfText>
<bot>Oh, right.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, would there be anything else on your tapes that might give the game away?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Well, think about that.<endOfText>
<bot>This obviously isn't going to come up as an issue for quite a long time, since transcribing this'll be a long time.<endOfText>
<human>But  I think what, perhaps the, the best thing to do is when the transcriptions come back, and this may not be till the summer  because it is a very long long process, when they come back, they will all go back to the person who made them  ten people.<endOfText>
<bot>And if you don't want to be put onto  list, censored, because obviously, that's very important to  what would happen there if you want it preserved.<endOfText>
<human>But if you don't want it preserved, I think it would be  so nice to have in college, if only for next year's students, and you also would be around for the next two years, I mean  if you're doing, if you're doing a language erm, option next year,or even a language recitation erm, this would be quite nice material to use for that.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos you will be around to, to, to make use of it at home.<endOfText>
<human>Anyway, so much for that  Assignment sheet  I'll give this to all of you, because  I wouldn't, I don't want to be unfair.<endOfText>
<bot>If you think that this assignment is, is sort of preferable to the ones that you've been looking, you could all choose this one, you'll have to do some recording like the others on your own machines, but you could  <endOfText>
<human>have we still got to do two thousand ?<endOfText>
<bot>No, hang on, no hang on.<endOfText>
<human>No, I'll change the length for those people who are doing a lot of recording.<endOfText>
<bot>And there's more transcribing.<endOfText>
<human>So listen very carefully.<endOfText>
<bot>Listen, listen very carefully  shh, because this is important to get right, erm, because the assign because the assignments are part of your degree mark, and have to go to the external examiner, and has to be monitored etcetera etcetera etcetera, it's all quite formal and so we do need to get this right.<endOfText>
<human>I, I've got to have something from you ten people, you ten recording people because, because it's reasonably erm, represented, like, I can't give it, in other words I can't give you a chance to explain this as much as I would like to, because it's not fair on the other people.<endOfText>
<bot>And it's also, but not fair on you or me, because I felt, the guilty, you know, we won't be, we all do it.<endOfText>
<human>There won't be any depreciation.<endOfText>
<bot>Some people won't do anything less than the others.<endOfText>
<human>I've got to have something that I can mark, to the representative marks that show your, your ability and how much you've put into it.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, so, supposing you're all doing this.<endOfText>
<human>You don't have to, but supposing you all choose this.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's put two columns.<endOfText>
<human>The British National Corpus  those ten people were doing British National Corpus and the others.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll write down any differences on here and make sure you write them down at the end.<endOfText>
<human>Transcription  this project is based on a study of recording two, that wouldn't apply to all of you, should involve  recording itself, audio cassette.<endOfText>
<bot>The others can  them from that.<endOfText>
<human>You can't, because you are doing audio cassettes for the erm, audio .<endOfText>
<bot>And your transcription of two to three set of minutes of talk.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, a transcription  two to three minutes, you can do a short transcription.<endOfText>
<bot>The Corpus people, you're going to spend much more time doing on the art of transcribing.<endOfText>
<human>So you'll have five minutes to do some.<endOfText>
<bot>He's put at least five minutes, five minutes plus.<endOfText>
<human>At least five minutes of transcription, erm, which you'll learn to do next week on Friday.<endOfText>
<bot>Now I'll put a line to do a transcription   transcription goes in an appendix, put your transcription at the back of your work, in according to Appendix A and number the lines, so that you can refer to them in the body or wherever.<endOfText>
<human>You'll find ten as an example of whatever.<endOfText>
<bot>Temptations are particularly evident in lines sixteen to seventeen etcetera.<endOfText>
<human>It saves a lot of time to change numbers.<endOfText>
<bot>You should follow your transcription with an exclamation   if used to indicate stress intonation, pauses, local effects etcetera etcetera etcetera.<endOfText>
<human>Er, in other words a key.<endOfText>
<bot>So everybody   put in a general key.<endOfText>
<human>A transcription is a key.<endOfText>
<bot>And this explains what you'll do next week.<endOfText>
<human>Don't worry about the key because that's just what erm,discussing, next time.<endOfText>
<bot>if you go into appendix as well.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, let's call between appendix two, just to make it absolutely cut and dried.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, Appendix A transcription and Appendix B was  .<endOfText>
<human>Erm, you can use ordinary spelling, you probably will use ordinary spelling, or phonetic transcription, this may be for short sections.<endOfText>
<bot>That's entirely optional, we'll talk again about that next week.<endOfText>
<human>a transcription you remember last year, we had about one week on phonetics, and John , some people came to the John  talk, where we didn't really talk about phonetics script there.<endOfText>
<bot>Phonetic script is something that people usually, fills people with horror, so don't worry about it.<endOfText>
<human>Some people, there are always a few people who, who love it.<endOfText>
<bot>Who like playing with it.<endOfText>
<human>But there are very few, so that's optional.<endOfText>
<bot>It is very useful, if you're trying to write down something like accent, say northern accent, would be, but would sound in words like cook,there's no way of really doing that unless you use phonetic transcription.<endOfText>
<human>But, erm, you may not, you may not want to do that.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, but so give, give a brief note to justify your choice, and use transcripts or you haven't because  that's at the end of your .<endOfText>
<human>That's, that's the next .<endOfText>
<bot>Introduction  your introduction should explain briefly why you chose to analyze this particular sample.<endOfText>
<human>You people, the Corpus people will have a large sample by then, you'll have a lot to choose from.<endOfText>
<bot>So just put a paragraph in, saying why you've chosen this particular bit, and in fact, all of you can do that.<endOfText>
<human>The introduction will be same for all of you.<endOfText>
<bot>Explaining your choice   this conversation especially interesting.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, do a general account of recording material indicating its source and giving background information.<endOfText>
<bot>But when I say recording material, I just mean one conversation that you're, you're transcribing.<endOfText>
<human>If you were to do, if any of your transcripts in lots of little bits.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>So I just want two, two to do two comparing tape.<endOfText>
<bot>Got two conversations of different people but they<endOfText>
<human>They vary in interest <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, don't don't make it too bitty.<endOfText>
<human>I'm just thinking if you did lots and lots of little bits, I think you'll find it quite difficult to make the rest of it coherent.<endOfText>
<bot>If you've got something that's crying out in comparison about two labourers or two women or whatever.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>But that would be two and a half minutes each, roughly.<endOfText>
<human>Between two and three <endOfText>
<bot>Erm, so, this material, whether it's one longer bit, or two shorter bits, it's up over there.<endOfText>
<human>Do you have any indication of its source, and say something about the background of people.<endOfText>
<bot>What kind of things will be important for the background to mention it do you think?<endOfText>
<human>Age.<endOfText>
<bot>Age.<endOfText>
<human>The relationship with them.<endOfText>
<bot>Relationship.<endOfText>
<human>The setting <endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>In fact, all those, yes, all those, I did briefly mention all those things on the diagram er that we had before.<endOfText>
<bot>You could do this, erm,you could photocopy<endOfText>
<human>Introductions<endOfText>
<bot>introductions.<endOfText>
<human>Source, the background<endOfText>
<bot>The background information.<endOfText>
<human>These things here, could be, you could photocopy these, the diagram that you've all got.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, maybe photocopy it a bit smaller.<endOfText>
<human>So that you've got an A four size.<endOfText>
<bot>Or even, even try to get perhaps, piece, a piece of A three paper.<endOfText>
<human>I'm just trying to think of a clearer economical way of putting it.<endOfText>
<bot>Perhaps a double size piece of paper you can fold in your  and then put the diagram in the middle, photocopy it, and stick it on, glue it on, the diagram.<endOfText>
<human>And then you could put arrows round the outside, for comments that you might  conversation, erm, conversation A and B, if you're doing two.<endOfText>
<bot>Then you would need two of the , two of these sheets if you were doing two conversations, but only one if you've done one.<endOfText>
<human>And then  say, for example, the thing over here was, something like bystanders, wasn't it, on the left hand side.<endOfText>
<bot>So you could just  all out in rhyming prose which takes a long time.<endOfText>
<human>A lot clearer could be erm, let's say bystanders,bystanders three, two of whom were half listening.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, just a short note, if you see the big  lot of  over there, and er, I think it would have been probably easier trying to describing it.<endOfText>
<human>Is that Appendix C?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, well I put it at the .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>You  it's in the introduction here.<endOfText>
<human>You could have an instruction  full details of the situation are given in Appendix C.<endOfText>
<bot>Or you could put it into your introduction depending on which way you feel it is to handle.<endOfText>
<human>So, is that clear?<endOfText>
<bot>Introduction, why you've chosen to, to analyze this sample, and what is a source on the background information.<endOfText>
<human>Indicate the focus of interest in the approach you intend to take.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll come back to that.<endOfText>
<human>. Next, the body of your essay.<endOfText>
<bot>Analyze your material by means of selected description of interesting and significant features of material transcribed.<endOfText>
<human>With reference if necessary to features, in the rest  transcribe it.<endOfText>
<bot>Recording.<endOfText>
<human>And conclusion, comment on the insights of your final analysis.<endOfText>
<bot>The body, shall I say.<endOfText>
<human>The other people who are  two thousand words.<endOfText>
<bot>And follow this thing about the body in your essay.<endOfText>
<human>So that you want to say exactly what is interesting and significant to you too.<endOfText>
<bot>So you pick up these things.<endOfText>
<human>Once you've done this, pick out the things that you think are significant.<endOfText>
<bot>The bystanders may not be significant.<endOfText>
<human>There may be two bystanders, but they really, you don't think they made any particular difference to the way the conversation went, so you might pick out relationships in general, or topic, or something else, but pick out the things that you think being significant in the conversation, and describe them.<endOfText>
<bot>In some detail, because you've got two  to do it  I think that's all.<endOfText>
<human>And then, conclude by what have you learnt about the talk,make sure the  and then the appendix should include your transcription which a key.<endOfText>
<bot>There's one not, not in there, not for example, the book you've already got tells you  transcription and submit your tape round to the position at which your transcription  two thousand words.<endOfText>
<human>So really Harlow do not do Corpus or at least were not aware of it.<endOfText>
<bot>If you are doing a lot of work  reports, you're going to do a longer transcription, and the transcription's going to , cos you've got to make sure that your transcription's according to the basis of  consistent in its way around.<endOfText>
<human>It's useable by  it's going to go into the, the archives for public consumption.<endOfText>
<bot>So the trade lock for this extra transcription is if you do more than, or if you do a lot, erm do the same introduction, but your essay, the body of your essay, erm, can be very short, the body of your essay, erm, about  one paragraph only, you're just going to need to do something quite short, and your conclusion on the insights is what, is what is going to be important .<endOfText>
<human>Okay, so that's, that's short.<endOfText>
<bot>The main body of yo the work wo with Corpus will be doing more of the transcription and linking up with what insights have been found about  transcribing.<endOfText>
<human>Any facts about transcribing  finished .<endOfText>
<bot>And the whole thing can be shorter, one thousand .<endOfText>
<human>I don't think you should have so much, and I'm not going to count, so I'm not going <endOfText>
<bot>You'll obviously want to make it, you don't want to make it too short  you're going to have enough words to get yourself a good mark.<endOfText>
<human>So you can wr do more transcribing.<endOfText>
<bot>Even if you're doing more recording, more transcribing,nicely.<endOfText>
<human>The writing will have a different focus.<endOfText>
<bot>Insights about the, the actual recording and transcribing.<endOfText>
<human>Transcribing .<endOfText>
<bot>Erm,fact clear.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>in saying, erm, we in fact, you know, backup our  transcription.<endOfText>
<human>Erm,<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, the more you can do, the better it gets.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, do use, you need a bibliography, all of you need a bibliography so you can make comparisons  what other people have found, so to read round before you do  but erm<endOfText>
<human>If you balance, tape recordering , but, but you notice one particular piece that you would rather do an essay on rather than that bit there.<endOfText>
<bot>Can you do the other one?<endOfText>
<human>If  takes it  to transcribe it, can we still write the essay?<endOfText>
<bot>Rather than do this.<endOfText>
<human>You know what I mean?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Do the essay on the left,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>to be transcribed on the right.<endOfText>
<bot>Even though?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, I think it would be a pity if you did that, because we got all this, you know, equipment and stuff, if you don't, why do you think it might be ?<endOfText>
<bot>Transcription gonna take ages to type.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, right.<endOfText>
<bot>days.<endOfText>
<human>No, I don't think it'll take days.<endOfText>
<bot>Because conversations are usually quite slow, and to, and there will be a lot of pauses <endOfText>
<human>It is difficult to guess how much transcription is needed.<endOfText>
<bot>I think maybe  what I'm going to do with transcriptions again.<endOfText>
<human>Cover the variations in speed, I'm going to try and define it in pages rather than speed, because finding it difficult is speed,whereas if you got a sl a slow speaker there are longer pauses and hesitations.<endOfText>
<bot>This is going to be a lot more  erm, let's call it two pages and five pages.<endOfText>
<human>A four pages.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, and I've no idea the time <endOfText>
<human>Let's change it to pages.<endOfText>
<bot>Because, it is, I think that's much fairer than doing minutes, cos you still get the <endOfText>
<human>Do you mean pages as in both sides, or sides?<endOfText>
<bot>Sides, sides.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>So there are  sides.<endOfText>
<human>Sides, two sides.<endOfText>
<bot>So would it very boring just to go through this again?confusion.<endOfText>
<human>I'll just go through this again, because it's, you know, two different groups.<endOfText>
<bot>Who's not doing this?<endOfText>
<human>Who's not doing the Corpus?<endOfText>
<bot>Two thousand words, you can use video if you want to.<endOfText>
<human>That's audio.<endOfText>
<bot>You can tape it off the television or the radio for that.<endOfText>
<human>That's if you want to <endOfText>
<bot>Your transcription is shorter, cos they're two sides.<endOfText>
<human>Your key is the same.<endOfText>
<bot>You do your introduction at the back, with why you've chosen this as background.<endOfText>
<human>Why you've chosen this bit, and what is the background.<endOfText>
<bot>And then you just follow through with the introduction at the end.<endOfText>
<human>Corpus books, do also essays, many use audio, your transcription is long, let's see either side.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, it's the whole thing,<endOfText>
<human>I think he'd<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>The introduction, why you've chosen this particular conversation.<endOfText>
<bot>Then, just a little bit about the background.<endOfText>
<human>Or what you found about the conversation, but your completion is mainly about the insights of doing this erm, transcription.<endOfText>
<bot>No actually, it can't be, can it?<endOfText>
<human>I don't think it does count.<endOfText>
<bot>It doesn't, it doesn't <endOfText>
<human>It's in the appen it's the appendix at the back <endOfText>
<bot>Mm, you gonna ask her <endOfText>
<human>I'll ask her .<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, is this something to ?<endOfText>
<human>No,if you can do that, do that.<endOfText>
<bot>So we've got the choice?<endOfText>
<human>You've the choice.<endOfText>
<bot>You've got the choice.<endOfText>
<human>But, erm, I just thought perhaps erm, it would be unfair not to give you a choice.<endOfText>
<bot>Anne.<endOfText>
<human>The transcription is separate from the total number of words, isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes,<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>transcription itself,almost the  number of words.<endOfText>
<human>It would take ages to <endOfText>
<bot>words.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay.<endOfText>
<human>How soon .<endOfText>
<bot>If, if there are problems, because you can see I'm a little bit unsure of length, myself.<endOfText>
<human>I haven't done this before.<endOfText>
<bot>If there are problems,le we could work them through together, but I think this is much more interesting to be, sort o I think to be linked in with an outside project like this, and just to be working away in isolation, and so we'll feel our way experimentally.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, cos I mean, the conversation you might wanna use, well may go on much longer than five sides, so  you've got <endOfText>
<bot>Good point, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Take, just take a, a sa sample of it.<endOfText>
<bot>If you, yes, certainly, you can use bits, you  bits  of a long conversation if necessary.<endOfText>
<human>Are you gonna do  with Jo?<endOfText>
<bot>In case bits from the examiner penalizes yes, certainly, I'll justify that  he won't.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, because, if he, if you're worried about the external examiner.<endOfText>
<bot>Al although our college regulations say that, these  should be two thousand words or equivalent.<endOfText>
<human>It always says, or equivalent, that's  just in order to open up the possibilities like this, so that we're not caught by some legalistic oath.<endOfText>
<bot>So if you can use <endOfText>
<human>And so the equivalent for you who is doing the  <endOfText>
<bot>Sorry.<endOfText>
<human>One long conversation, you can use different parts of that one long conversation  is that what you say?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, no I didn't.<endOfText>
<human>I said,you got a, a long, a long conversation, say, ten minutes.<endOfText>
<bot>For our purposes you just need to take any bit, either the beginning, the middle or the end, that seem to be the best bit, the interesting bit.<endOfText>
<human>If I take out a chunk, you can do <endOfText>
<bot>I do think that you're, when you're doing it, thinking of doing two bits,<endOfText>
<human>But I just like to <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>But you're, well you, supposing you've got two long conversations, what you want to do is two  bits, I can transfer bits out of <endOfText>
<bot>If erm, you know the way the transcript was written down.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, sorry.<endOfText>
<bot>Well,to write on it, because it, you'll have some on one <endOfText>
<human>The overlap, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, let's talk about those technicalities next week.<endOfText>
<human>You may have to do it in longhand.<endOfText>
<bot>Too difficult to type.<endOfText>
<human>Wh when it's, when you get, when you're getting interruptions, like we just had then<endOfText>
<bot>Great <endOfText>
<human>you're transcribing this  erm, it is, it is a problem  wordprocessor.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And er, of course, if you're really ca cunning, you may say well, five sides is a difficult, erm, difficult criterion, because let's write B,<endOfText>
<bot>but we can't, we can't up against every  use your commonsense on that.<endOfText>
<human>Do you have to type the essay?<endOfText>
<bot>Preferably yes, it's much easier to mark it, and I must say, research, research shows, that a clearly typed essay does tend to get a better mark.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, I hate typing essays  <endOfText>
<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>It does what?<endOfText>
<bot>There has been.<endOfText>
<human>Get that mark.<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>People have done research,giving marks to <endOfText>
<bot>long though.<endOfText>
<human>the same piece of work handwritten and typed.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, and it, it does score higher <endOfText>
<human>when it's typed.<endOfText>
<bot>People are influenced.<endOfText>
<human>We're human and you, you're influenced by presentation, so if you can type it  it's not compulsory, but it is, would be in your interest that it's typed, if you can.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you going to do the one on the left hand side.<endOfText>
<human>Would you still have to mention things like eye contact and gesture, and  that?<endOfText>
<bot>Or does it ?<endOfText>
<human>I can't do that, I  thing on our tape.<endOfText>
<bot>have we been through the  of this group?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>We went through them, didn't we?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>What was that all the talk about <endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>No, that's the second part  <endOfText>
<human>We haven't done anything, have we?<endOfText>
<bot>assignment.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, you're right.<endOfText>
<bot>We went through the situation and background, but I don't think we did that.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, when we were looking at all the markers like erm,<endOfText>
<bot>gesture, gesture  and strategy,this we need to this morning.<endOfText>
<human>yes, and we'll come back to <endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>ridiculous.<endOfText>
<bot>So, for the rest of this morning, erm, we're going to  back on what you brought in.<endOfText>
<human>On  on conversational management.<endOfText>
<bot>We were going to do that last week.<endOfText>
<human>But we didn't.<endOfText>
<bot>the work  to that.<endOfText>
<human>You, you just see what each other are doing, because I'm going to put you into lots of groups in a minute.<endOfText>
<bot>I want, what I want you to do is get into groups of four in a minute, according to these instructions.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, groups of four, so we can use these pairs like this, so we can all talk to each other in a foursome.<endOfText>
<bot>So we can move around.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, and I want to make sure that you've got, those four people have all done something different from here.<endOfText>
<bot>Tell each other what you've done  different bits of the worksheet.<endOfText>
<human>So I'll just, have a look round to see if who, who's done what.<endOfText>
<bot>Who did topic charts?<endOfText>
<human>So you need to be separated.<endOfText>
<bot>Go to another group.<endOfText>
<human>Two, two did topic choice.<endOfText>
<bot>I did some.<endOfText>
<human>And three.<endOfText>
<bot>Make sure you're in different groups.<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Turn taking, turn distribution.<endOfText>
<human>Who did that?<endOfText>
<bot>Me.<endOfText>
<human>One, two, three, so we separate yourself into different groups.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, speakers holding the floor and the next bit.<endOfText>
<human>One, who are you working with?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, Jo, she's not here, today.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>So it doesn't matter where you go.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, those turn, use turn <endOfText>
<bot>What did you two do?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, I was opening conversation <endOfText>
<bot>Opening and closing, yes, it's down here.<endOfText>
<human>So make sure, again, you split up.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, what did she just say?<endOfText>
<human>What did you do?<endOfText>
<bot>I did that, and you did what?<endOfText>
<human>right, okay, we can stay together.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know, I might just about copy this out.<endOfText>
<human>thing is,<endOfText>
<bot>Can we have four groups.<endOfText>
<human>Get into four groups <endOfText>
<bot>English  <endOfText>
<human>erm, round the tables  cos it's easier to talk.<endOfText>
<bot>Different erm<endOfText>
<human>Oh, you can come with us, if you want.<endOfText>
<bot>No, I'll probably go into the next <endOfText>
<human>Oops, bloody chair.<endOfText>
<bot>Hang on, what is it, what have we got to do now?<endOfText>
<human>Got to do this date.<endOfText>
<bot>Today's the fifteenth.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Has anyone, I don't think we've got anybody who's on this wrong assignment.<endOfText>
<human>No, we haven't.<endOfText>
<bot>Wrong assignment.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>What we gotta do, just stick, discuss what we, our findings.<endOfText>
<bot>Right erm, I'll break at, at about ten past, quarter past, so we've got about ten minutes  or quarter of an hour.<endOfText>
<human>We're just exchanging what you've found in your groups.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, you haven't got everything represented there, but you've all got quite a lot,quite a large chunk of them actually.<endOfText>
<human>So, make sure that you get from each other what  you've all got.<endOfText>
<bot>The best way of organizing this for your file, is  file of reports.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah,<endOfText>
<bot>You,ho you should ideally all have a  ouch,a file like this  and, before I pick this up, erm, the best way of organizing your files and just, just take separate bits of paper now, to save yourselves time, is to take separate pieces of paper for the separate topics, that separate people have done, and as you're talking to each other, begin making notes and adding to, to these different bits.<endOfText>
<human>So for example, topic choice, could be one bit of paper, and term taken erm, opening and closing, would be another<endOfText>
<bot>I suppose body language you,couldn't yeah,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>sort of,<endOfText>
<human>looking at their <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah<endOfText>
<human>terrible, terrible.<endOfText>
<bot>It's my turn now.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>If you want.<endOfText>
<human>I'm sorry, no.<endOfText>
<bot>Alright, erm, how do speakers talk <endOfText>
<human>Talk.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, they give a complex number of cues, erm, when they are about to finish their conversation, erm, I  how did they manage to  it's shown, it shown through the gaze of the speaker  erm, erm, the speaker coming to the end of long actions has been shown to gaze heavily at the listener.<endOfText>
<bot>So, well, actually  so you know it's .<endOfText>
<human>Doesn't make any sense, does it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, also inclination of head towards the listener  and erm  erm, how did they feel that they'd finished the  erm, speaker's intonation and a drop in volume of voice  towards the end, and erm, also you've got quite a full  tags.<endOfText>
<bot>Like, I speak something and, and I say, you know, so you know, you know what it means.<endOfText>
<human>That indicates the person.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, and gestures as well, things like definite body movements, like  like I say something, then<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I point away to you  you know that I've finished my conversation.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, and, any terms at all, usually, about erm,conversations with your friends, usually it's okay just to interrupt your friends.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, they're quite frequent in friendly conversations  and, but in casual conversations, one of three things happen.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, current speaker will  next speaker by name, so when I speak to you and I call your name, you know that I am talking to you.<endOfText>
<human>It's the cue to the next person.<endOfText>
<bot>Does it make any sense?<endOfText>
<human>Tell me if <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, so  but if the speaker doesn't announce the other one by name, the third one erm, realize, may react himself.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>So erm, if two or more do this at the same time, first person's to speak call the talk.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes?<endOfText>
<human>So you <endOfText>
<bot>that one.<endOfText>
<human>So if two or more do this thing like, if they don't call your name, there at the same time, the first person to speak will be four.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>Does it make sense?<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>I think,<endOfText>
<human>Okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Good.<endOfText>
<human>I did, actually,mine was the role of silence.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, there's three different types of silence.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, the first one is called a lapse  erm, and that happens when the person who's speaking, hasn't selected the next speaker, or nobody who's  self-selected.<endOfText>
<bot>So, and the person who's speaking decides not to go on, so perhaps the conversation has stopped.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, the second sort is a gap which is a brief silence, usually sort of one second or less, between the end of one turn, and the next speaker actually starting to speak, so they're still thinking about what they're going to say.<endOfText>
<bot>So that's a gap, then there's the third type is a pause, this is terribly complicated, erm, this is a silence within somebody's turn, so it could happen in one of three ways.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, either the person is erm, thinking of what to say, in search of the right words, so they have a pause within their turn and then carry on.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, or they stop, the current speaker stops thinking that somebody might want to join in, or the erm,spea current speaker chooses the next one, but the person they choose takes so long to actually respond, the current speaker carries on, because he thinks they're not going to say anything.<endOfText>
<human>Can we go over those again  just the pause one.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, right, so a pause silence within a participant's turn, so the current speaker just has a pause, then carries on speaking,<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>so it can happen in one of three ways.<endOfText>
<human>Either they're thinking of what to say next  or they stop, thinking that somebody else might want to join in, but they don't, so that the current speaker then carries on<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>or the speaker who's speaking, selects the next speaker by saying, didn't you think, or whatever, but the person they've chosen takes so long to answer, that the current speaker just carries on<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>cos they think they're not going to get a response  I mean it, it, it can't get much er, can't get very much going on this.<endOfText>
<bot>A lot of these sort of inter-relate, don't they, really, I mean <endOfText>
<human>just the sake of <endOfText>
<bot>Just say something every now and again, don't they?<endOfText>
<human>Oh dear.<endOfText>
<bot>How did you get in this morning, did you walk?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, nice day, innit it, bloody cold out there, though.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, innit.<endOfText>
<bot>Nice bright morning, though,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Least it's not raining.<endOfText>
<human>That's true.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think <endOfText>
<human>Where do you live?<endOfText>
<bot>Do you?<endOfText>
<human>Are you in trouble every day <endOfText>
<bot>Blimey<endOfText>
<human>Commutes.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh no.<endOfText>
<human>It's alright, actually, the worst it takes me is about an hour.<endOfText>
<bot>When it's really busy, but <endOfText>
<human>Is that from home?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, erm, this morning,yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Do, do you cycle?<endOfText>
<human>till half eight.<endOfText>
<bot>I think you should.<endOfText>
<human>Bound to  isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>But I don't know  think it would be easier?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah <endOfText>
<human>The thing is that you know <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I just, I just <endOfText>
<human>Whereabouts do you live <endOfText>
<bot>Oh, right, ah    thank you  but you could come any  other time.<endOfText>
<human>I'll give you a ring <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>in the evening.<endOfText>
<bot>It's a different  it's just that Sunday's free for me.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, what do you do, what do you do on <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, on Monday, my cousin is, is coming.<endOfText>
<human>I think that Sunday she's free, but I've got to  to get at her, and on Monday I've got to go up to walk her round to see her .<endOfText>
<bot>She's going to .<endOfText>
<human>But if I  you come and watch  I'm definitely,<endOfText>
<bot>so we've got a cottage nearby <endOfText>
<human>What semi-detached?<endOfText>
<bot>I've gotta come round.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, you've certainly <endOfText>
<bot>Someone's gotta come round  I mean just to see where  but I just  I'll ring, I'll give you a buzz on Monday, I know you're not there, you can say,well, I'll see you again on Tuesday in English, perhaps you can arrange something then.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay, well I think this is a good erm, juncture at which to stop.<endOfText>
<human>Come back in twenty minutes at the most, and we'll bring this together.<endOfText>
<bot>No, that's my <endOfText>
<human>What we just said <endOfText>
<bot>What we just said we got there.<endOfText>
<human>sounding right.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I yeah  sorry <endOfText>
<human>Could  do it.<endOfText>
<bot>Aye.<endOfText>
<human>Just listen to her tapes.<endOfText>
<bot>Except honestly, she's just  lazy.<endOfText>
<human>Can't treat her own  can't wash her.<endOfText>
<bot>She no asked to speak to you <endOfText>
<human>No, I went round to with Mr Muscle, I went shh, shh, shh <endOfText>
<bot>But suppose you can't  doesn't he get really  about the bed made?<endOfText>
<human>One of the beds.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, it's horrible.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>wipe  and everything.<endOfText>
<bot>You have to the get mattress out urgh, it's awful.<endOfText>
<human>on the beds.<endOfText>
<bot>Okay,<endOfText>
<human>I'll tell you what, when I have rugby practice, I'll come and have a shower.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, and I believe it.<endOfText>
<human>I believe it.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm not joking.<endOfText>
<human>You get used to wash erm, at least your own scum out of erm,<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, it was you, was it?<endOfText>
<human>And erm,you just got to be, you know a mum would, a mum and that <endOfText>
<bot>You know my mum came up, she comes up and says I know this already  you know, mum came up, saying,<endOfText>
<human>yeah well, Essex, probably Essex University, Anne goes to <endOfText>
<bot>I think it pays a bit better.<endOfText>
<human>I've done it even though <endOfText>
<bot>Have you?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>worked out what I am saying <endOfText>
<human>Oh.<endOfText>
<bot>I still <endOfText>
<human>Thank God I'm not <endOfText>
<bot>What?<endOfText>
<human>You alright?<endOfText>
<bot>Fine, thank you.<endOfText>
<human>Ah  scratch  last night.<endOfText>
<bot>Ah <endOfText>
<human>little man.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, you did?<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>He goes  I can't believe  <endOfText>
<human>And erm, clothes in general?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>So you try to  go to visit him, or him come over here?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Tell him  that could be good.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>try it again and  I want to do two things for the rest of the morning.<endOfText>
<bot>Two separate things, so see whether we can  work fast.<endOfText>
<human>First of all, this feedback, on what you were doing before coffee, and secondly  talk about some of those markers and the speakers that been brought to my attention  talked about with the other group, but not you.<endOfText>
<bot>This, the sheet on conversation rules.<endOfText>
<human>There's relatively few rules feeling that, types erm, belong to each other.<endOfText>
<bot>I think the best thing in a way, is not to repeat what you've already said to each other.<endOfText>
<human>But to bring out questions, things that you felt in your groups that you would like to perhaps ask the others about, or came back and ask me, any particular points that you  to read on or weren't clear when you were talking in a group, or things that you felt the others might  you know,to talk about.<endOfText>
<bot>Let's just run through it, erm, on topic choice.<endOfText>
<human>Do you all feel in your separate groups, that erm, you've covered that?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>You've talking about it   choosing a, choosing a topic and changing topics.<endOfText>
<bot>You couldn't have got  <endOfText>
<human>Anything that's, anything that came up that was, that you felt you wanted to tell the others about?<endOfText>
<bot>No, not really.<endOfText>
<human>Choosing and changing topics are, are going to appear, I'm, I'm saying rightly, that it's going to be at first hard.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>In an extreme situation, we've got something like an in situ situation so the interviewer will have much more power, and has the total rights to change the topic and choose the topic, and cut off the topic when it's finished.<endOfText>
<bot>So that's an example that gives us very much asymmetrical different amounts apart, and then you get the other end of the, the, the other extreme, you got to select, you know, you got to  your power, your friendship group, and so when got to do, to choose whichever  amongst friends.<endOfText>
<human>Would you agree with that?<endOfText>
<bot>I'm changing,on the right hand side there <endOfText>
<human>Erm, right, Okay!<endOfText>
<bot>Er,thinking about <endOfText>
<human>Is there any money?<endOfText>
<bot>Don't get a chance.<endOfText>
<human>Are you <endOfText>
<bot>Is there a phone box near your house?<endOfText>
<human>No, but we have got a telephone, and you're more than welcome to use it.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>What you've got to remember though, that's what's seek <endOfText>
<bot>He gave you the phone number, didn't he ?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>It's just I, I was sitting here, haven't phoned my parents to say I got back here alright.<endOfText>
<human>That's alright.<endOfText>
<bot>You can ring your parents.<endOfText>
<human>We'll all be in the kitchen, so <endOfText>
<bot>Are you recording this now?<endOfText>
<human>I don't think that  <endOfText>
<bot>Oh, no.<endOfText>
<human>Hi.<endOfText>
<bot>Shh, don't know  <endOfText>
<human>Oh, alright.<endOfText>
<bot>Sorry.<endOfText>
<human>Ignore that bit.<endOfText>
<bot>Gone quiet now.<endOfText>
<human>I didn't realize, in fact, oh yeah, let's talk about all the men that Claire's been hanging out with.<endOfText>
<bot>The tape recorder's on.<endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, did you switch the tape recorder on?<endOfText>
<human>Is it on?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>What's he talking about?<endOfText>
<human>You're not allowed <endOfText>
<bot>I'm gonna have to scrub all this bit, now.<endOfText>
<human>You could use it.<endOfText>
<bot>It'll give you something to talk about.<endOfText>
<human>I didn't hear, I didn't hear you saying you were putting tape recorder on.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll tell you afterwards, you see, and then I'll ask you whether you, anyone's got any objections,<endOfText>
<human>Erm, well, actual cardinal board of sinners, you've really scored the lot.<endOfText>
<bot>Just in case for some reason they'll correlate, it doesn't matter.<endOfText>
<human>There's that girl that you think I fancy again, just moving down there.<endOfText>
<bot>Ah, moving, oh where, where?<endOfText>
<human>What does she look like?<endOfText>
<bot>Legs up to her armpits.<endOfText>
<human>No, you I used to know her from church in Oxford, before she moved down here.<endOfText>
<bot>What I keep saying, we must, we must get to know her better.<endOfText>
<human>We mustn't <endOfText>
<bot>I know, think you're going to <endOfText>
<human>Yes, darling, right, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>No, I'm just being friendly, cos when we moved into the church, people invited us around a lot, and it was really nice.<endOfText>

<bot>Why did she  <endOfText>

<human>I got it twice the size, though.<endOfText>
<bot>That's eighteen <endOfText>
<human>Eighteen.<endOfText>
<bot>thirty five <endOfText>
<human>Oh, that's silly that.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, that's rather pricey.<endOfText>
<human>No, no, not pricey.<endOfText>
<bot>Is that <endOfText>
<human>I followed you there.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, wasn't it cold this morning?<endOfText>
<human>It was <endOfText>
<bot>It was icy, wasn't it?<endOfText>
<human>What was that?<endOfText>
<bot>I'm sitting on the <endOfText>
<human>And I was talking, cos I walked along, I walked down towards Twickenham, but I walked to way you go to  when I went straight down to Twickenham.<endOfText>
<bot>Whose is that?<endOfText>
<human>Twenty minutes, I suppose.<endOfText>
<bot>but it's so cold.<endOfText>
<human>Oh it was horrible.<endOfText>
<bot>I couldn't believe it, the  room where the seminar had been <endOfText>
<human>Yes, that came into the  again.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I had such a lovely day, it's so nice and sunny and warm, should have  did send me a card <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, exactly  a card.<endOfText>
<bot>You know, you carry on down the motorway, like the sun was on, on, and I was really getting sweaty hot with the sun, it was like on the win on the on er, the window<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>and it was strange, but it was really warm cos you having the window, and ah that was really hot.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I would have said that the white one<endOfText>
<human>Well, have we got six?<endOfText>
<bot>Six <endOfText>
<human>Oh, that's okay.<endOfText>
<bot>Just seeing if we've got enough plates.<endOfText>
<human>There you are.<endOfText>
<bot>You should have said, we could have brought some round.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, we won't turn this light off.<endOfText>
<bot>Yo you can't see.<endOfText>
<human>Is that alright?<endOfText>
<bot>That's fine, yes, sorry.<endOfText>
<human>Miles away.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, that's nothing.<endOfText>
<human>reckon it costs much to run these lights underneath here?<endOfText>
<bot>No, cos they're fluorescent, it's only about twelve watts, it's less than a light bulb.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, I see.<endOfText>
<bot>You got an  electricity bill?<endOfText>
<human>Twenty seven.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, what <endOfText>
<human>Twenty seven, that's not bad.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, we, I don't think that's bad.<endOfText>
<human>Mind you <endOfText>
<bot>a quarter, that looks quite good.<endOfText>
<human>Can't be a quarter, must be a month, surely.<endOfText>
<bot>Before you put the heating on.<endOfText>
<human>Is it estimated?<endOfText>
<bot>It says for a quarter, which means you're paying a quarter's erm, like charge, which is s seven quid, but it's only actually for a, a month.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>To the end of October.<endOfText>
<human>Was it estimated?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, no.<endOfText>
<human>Well you know <endOfText>
<bot>Can't be a quarter.<endOfText>
<human>That's right.<endOfText>
<bot>Don don't you get a monthly electricity bill?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Quarterly.<endOfText>
<human>Quarterly.<endOfText>
<bot>But the they give it you at the end of the quarter, even if you haven't been in for a quarter.<endOfText>
<human>See what I mean?<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>So they do November, December, don't they?<endOfText>
<bot>October, November, December is one quarter.<endOfText>
<human>So it's right, you move in in September, then they'll give you, they'll charge you <endOfText>
<bot>You'll get that quarter's bill, but it's only since <endOfText>
<human>Right, I'll come and sit down and drink my tea.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, I see.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>Non-stop  <endOfText>
<human>Oh, it's nice to have a sit down.<endOfText>
<bot>The thing is, I thought I need to write to them, because when we just sent Mr  <endOfText>
<human>yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>bill for the quarter between the second of August and the twentieth of September, and he had to pay seven quid for standing charges for that bill.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>And we've had to pay it for from the twentieth of September to the eighth of October.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, I see.<endOfText>
<bot>So we've had to pay another seven quid something.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>But we, surely we shouldn't, cos we're, it's not for a month, it's only for <endOfText>
<human>A matter of weeks.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, it's not for a quarter, it's only for, you know, whatever.<endOfText>
<human>Probably be, the next bill you get will probably be bumped up a bit, because you've had the heating on, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, I don't really think I, at the moment we only <endOfText>
<bot>need to have the heating on in the hall<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, that's right.<endOfText>
<bot>and in our rooms,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>and if it do it does get really cold in the lounge, but at the moment, we're managing.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Could have water bottles, we've already got water bottles.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, we all crowd on top <endOfText>
<bot>Used to be really  sitting there with blankets and water bottles and everything watching the telly.<endOfText>
<human>Well.<endOfText>
<bot>We only need our heating on for an hour.<endOfText>
<human>Do you?<endOfText>
<bot>An hour in the morning.<endOfText>
<human>We have it on less, because it doesn't heat, I mean, standing in this lobby, it heats up so quickly<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>and especially if you're cooking as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>We're just like, the other day I was doing the washing-up and I was just like, stripping off  with my outer layers <endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>because I was so boiling.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>cos we'd had cooked, had the heating on, and now I did the washing-up in really hot water.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, it's very contained, as well so that probably the heat stayed<endOfText>
<human>But we'd have it on less, except you just can't, you lit physically on the clock, you can't put  erm <endOfText>
<bot>Down less than an hour <endOfText>
<human>well, you can't put the things any closer to one another, so, you know the, the little indicators that clicks  <endOfText>
<bot>One off  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>We've got those as close together as they can.<endOfText>
<bot>Close together <endOfText>
<human>It's actually on for two hours in the evening.<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>Is it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>I think it's two hours it's on for.<endOfText>
<bot>I thought it was one.<endOfText>
<human>No, I think it's two.<endOfText>
<bot>It's a bit silly really.<endOfText>
<human>Badly designed.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, yes.<endOfText>
<human>Well, perhaps we could, sort of file them, a size down  because  yack, yack yack  good .<endOfText>
<bot>You could have a go.<endOfText>
<human>Well, then, then you'd be able to get them closer.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm not doing that.<endOfText>
<human>Anything to have a try.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>So.<endOfText>
<bot>See how horrendous the next one is  and then panic.<endOfText>
<human>Then go, my God we can't pay it.<endOfText>
<bot>Pay it.<endOfText>
<human>Have to sell my soul to the devil himself.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Promise <endOfText>
<bot>as a play.<endOfText>
<human>Sell my soul to the de devil himself.<endOfText>
<bot>Shut up.<endOfText>
<human>way she says, that when she sell  that book.<endOfText>
<bot>Have you actually seen that?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos I think  <endOfText>

<bot>Actually, Classic Climbs of Great Britain is mine.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, and mo most of mine are up there.<endOfText>
<bot>Nick thinks that her, Nick, Nick thinks that her books are much nicer than my books, you see.<endOfText>
<human>What a liar .<endOfText>
<bot>So mine are relegated to the <endOfText>
<human>That's not true, they're all the God books up there.<endOfText>
<bot>Only climbing <endOfText>
<human>So they're in a high place.<endOfText>
<bot>The God books to be found, yeah they're up in a high place.<endOfText>
<human>Those are fiction paperbacks.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>The trash.<endOfText>
<bot>No, the <endOfText>
<human>Sort of cave books, cave man books.<endOfText>
<bot>They're actually really funny in places.<endOfText>
<human>Plain of the cave man.<endOfText>
<bot>Cave man.<endOfText>
<human>They weren't actually called plain of the cave man.<endOfText>
<bot>They're really highly acclaimed books.<endOfText>
<human>They're <endOfText>
<bot>Are they?<endOfText>
<human>thoroughly researched.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Actually, my friends at church, back home, used to call me erm, cos I, I sort of sometimes squeal when I get excited.<endOfText>

<bot>It's a, it's a change to keep her clothes on, so <endOfText>
<human>things I wanna go and watch.<endOfText>
<bot>So typical, isn't it, that when you go to see plays, you always like, dashing to the last minute to try and get tickets and been on for like, two months.<endOfText>
<human>How's that?<endOfText>
<bot>It's just goes on  <endOfText>
<human>Friday September the second.<endOfText>

<bot>Blimey, I didn't realize that.<endOfText>
<human>last night.<endOfText>
<bot>September the second.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>That's like <endOfText>

<bot>to go and see it <endOfText>
<human>Thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>at the Barbican, they were just completely sold out.<endOfText>
<human>Really cheesed off.<endOfText>
<bot>It was on all summer.<endOfText>
<human>That's like that Twelfth Night.<endOfText>
<bot>Never mind.<endOfText>
<human>So is the Orange Tree quite a famous theatre, then?<endOfText>
<bot>It's got a good name <endOfText>
<human>Good reputation.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>cos it's Rich Richmond, I don't know where Richmond Theatre is.<endOfText>
<bot>Where's Richmond Theatre?<endOfText>
<human>It's on the green.<endOfText>
<bot>Right I'm with you now.<endOfText>
<human>it's much bigger.<endOfText>
<bot>It's all <endOfText>
<human>Isn't that <endOfText>
<bot>It's really posh.<endOfText>
<human>is a preview  the one before the their run.<endOfText>
<bot>Preview is where you get the press going along, don't you?<endOfText>
<human>It's usually, erm, you know, like a dress rehearsal,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>where it ha it gets a reaction between the audience and the erm,<endOfText>
<bot>Right, because in there, if you pay fifteen pounds, you get erm, you get tickets for, you know you only have to pay four pounds, plus you get half price tickets for <endOfText>
<human>When did you see that, Phil?<endOfText>
<bot>normal productions <endOfText>
<human>Really?<endOfText>
<bot>Friends of the Orange Tree   The preview club.<endOfText>
<human>For just fifteen pounds per year, you can become a member of the Orange Tree Theatre's preview club.<endOfText>
<bot>Ooh.<endOfText>
<human>You'll receive  two tickets for the price of one at preview performances.<endOfText>
<bot>Ah, that's good.<endOfText>
<human>Concession price tickets only four pounds each to performances in the room.<endOfText>
<bot>Regular newsletter of all production details.<endOfText>
<human>What's the room, is that separate?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah,<endOfText>
<human>Don't they mean it's lower, rather than the upper circle?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Does that look cheaper  than the  <endOfText>
<bot>I would say it's more expensive.<endOfText>
<human>Expensive.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't see why, I,<endOfText>
<human>Yes, yes, so would I, you know, right in the centre of the action, I thought we had brilliant seats.<endOfText>
<bot>Thing is though, you get an ov overall picture <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, whereas we get like the action right next to them.<endOfText>
<bot>you can probably be, be facing it and just the articulation's more.<endOfText>
<human>Where sometimes we had the back of the heads and  <endOfText>
<bot>cos like you probably saw a completely different play to us.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>You were sitting right the other side of the stairs <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, exactly.<endOfText>
<bot>So what do you reckon the room is?<endOfText>
<human>Just  on the floor?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, that's not bad is it?<endOfText>
<bot>Four pounds.<endOfText>
<human>To each performance.<endOfText>
<bot>Whereas if it had been standing room, we really would have been standing.<endOfText>
<human>I agree with like  <endOfText>
<bot>There was a couple of people <endOfText>
<human>when we went to see Fear,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah<endOfText>
<human>and it was like standing, and you'd be sitting on the steps<endOfText>
<bot>there were a couple of people standing, weren't there?<endOfText>
<human>cos it was really small.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>The Old Vic's er, venturing around as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Difficult evening, aren't you.<endOfText>
<human>Er, not the Old Vic, I beg your pardon, the Young Vic.<endOfText>

<human>The Queen Vic.<endOfText>
<bot>The more mature Vic.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>the lesser Vic.<endOfText>
<bot>You could buy, you could buy bar spaces, or seat spaces here.<endOfText>
<human>That's erm,yo did you notice those little name tags on the front of the seats in front of you?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Two hundred and fifty pounds each.<endOfText>
<human>Jes <endOfText>
<bot>So.<endOfText>
<human>To do what?<endOfText>

<human>It's just a money raising thing.<endOfText>
<bot>What do they do?<endOfText>
<human>Oh, it's just, it's just.<endOfText>
<bot>Have their name put on it.<endOfText>
<human>Part of the appeal, yeah, just to get your name on your seat.<endOfText>
<bot>But you're still looking at the bar spaces a hundred and fifty pounds, and seat spaces two hundred and fifty pounds.<endOfText>
<human>So there's still opportunities to join Arthur Daley, Adrian Edmondson, Sir John Geilgud, Derek Jacobi, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Dame Judy <endOfText>
<bot>Dench.<endOfText>
<human>Michael Caine, Julian <endOfText>
<bot>Those the people that have been there and put down their names on it?<endOfText>

<human>Can I try again.<endOfText>
<bot>Says here, smoking is not allowed.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I was quite surprised that woman was smoking in there, actually.<endOfText>
<bot>Quite surprised.<endOfText>
<human>By the bar area.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you mean in the theatre?<endOfText>
<human>Literally, and then you have to sit there with this cream on, and it's all very fiddly and messy and it smells.<endOfText>

<bot>And hairs growing out their toes and their legs and their underarms.<endOfText>
<human>They've got some coming out their big toes as well.<endOfText>
<bot>They have beards as well as <endOfText>
<human>It's such a British thing, isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>The way we talk.<endOfText>
<human>I know you don't like that we put on people, but <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, you say that, but you know, your, if you had underarm hair, no one would say hmm,that man's got underarm hair  I mean, it's quite alright, but for women to have underarm hair, it's just not.<endOfText>
<human>It's not fair, is it?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, it's stupid you wax your, why do you wax your legs  it's so stupid.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, why don't you wax the whole of your body?<endOfText>
<bot>But hair's normally a bit finer on your thighs, isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, it is, but then you just, I think you get hair paranoid.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, you do.<endOfText>
<bot>You just get <endOfText>
<human>I sit there with a pair of tweezers going  my mum thinks you're so fussy, and I'm like  <endOfText>
<bot>Well, I did, or you tend to be, you used to be Claire, when you used to wax your legs.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, my legs have rarely seen a Bic razor you know, I'm gonna wear a pair of shorts in the summer, I might shave 'em, but I  <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but that's where  slightly different to me, cos I'm<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>in shorts every day of the week in the gym for an hour, and I'm swimming<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, we know, yeah.<endOfText>

<bot>No, no.<endOfText>
<human>or light hair.<endOfText>
<bot>my legs, I suddenly realized when I was changing at the swimming pool, and thought oh sod it, who's gonna notice, I mean, at half past seven, I really can't get that excited about it.<endOfText>
<human>Nathan, who's the only bloke in our lane, but doesn't use contact lenses or anything, who's gonna notice,<endOfText>

<human>No, I have finished.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think you have, I think I interrupted <endOfText>
<human>No, I was just thinking,carry on.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't understand why some Asians, or some people that look as if they're Asian or Pakistani, actually come from Africa, because<endOfText>
<human>They don't do they?<endOfText>
<bot>They do.<endOfText>
<human>My boss  who is Pakistani, comes from Kenya.<endOfText>

<human>Oh, really.<endOfText>
<bot>Why, what she<endOfText>
<human>Painter.<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>So if you ever want anything  she'll <endOfText>
<bot>That's really good.<endOfText>
<human>My body.<endOfText>
<bot>Just here and here and<endOfText>
<human>She'll disguise your legs.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>The hair on the hairs them, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Could she erm, bleach my hairs white and then just like, make them look like skin?<endOfText>
<human>Stick them down <endOfText>
<bot>Save lots of money and time.<endOfText>
<human>It depends on your lifestyle you live, though, cos I got friends who are just like  ah, I don't like  and you have to excuse my hairy legs  running or something, I mean, I just like  they're like this, and they've got like black hair about this long, and I'm like  oh my God, oh my God, you're just like <endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>But it depends what she, she's, people like that mean to, cos I never wear anything li like trousers or long skirts and tights.<endOfText>
<bot>And I like erm around in shorts every day, and I'm on the swimming pool side three times a week, so I don't have much choice.<endOfText>
<human>Before we got married I just thought I had I'd never had my legs shaved er, waxed before.<endOfText>
<bot>So I <endOfText>
<human>I wanted to make sure they were long enough , and I went and started at Christmas, and I , er, this is so gross, and I just felt the scummiest thing, it was sort of, it's not exactly how you wanna feel just before you get married, and then I went and had my legs shaved  er waxed.<endOfText>
<bot>Waxed <endOfText>
<human>In fact, I got so much dirt,<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Is this two lots in here?<endOfText>
<human>Er,<endOfText>
<bot>Sorry?<endOfText>
<human>Just one full.<endOfText>
<bot>I did it very full, that's all.<endOfText>
<human>What did you think when they waxed them, especially.<endOfText>
<bot>I wasn't terribly impressed, actually.<endOfText>
<human>Really?<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>I was a bit disappointed.<endOfText>
<bot>But maybe I'm just a perfectionist, I don't know.<endOfText>
<human>Then when you shave, it's so <endOfText>
<bot>Is it bruised, or anything?<endOfText>
<human>No, I, I mean I looked a, like a bit of a plucked chicken every day, but <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, you do.<endOfText>
<human>had it done in the afternoon, that's okay, but I mean <endOfText>
<bot>You don't think I shall erm,<endOfText>
<human>you can't go in the sea for about two days, and you can't go in the sun <endOfText>
<bot>painful ain't it?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>Wahey.<endOfText>
<bot>They've got a new erm,<endOfText>
<human>Special razor.<endOfText>
<bot>razor, apparently<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, that's right.<endOfText>
<bot>new American one that you hold like that, and you just go,swi swi <endOfText>
<human>Big <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, that's right.<endOfText>
<human>Scrubbing brush.<endOfText>
<bot>My mum  couldn't believe it when I shaved my legs, thought it absolutely outrageous.<endOfText>
<human>What are you doing, I said, I'm just shaving my legs.<endOfText>
<bot>If I nick my face I think there's a<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>blood bath.<endOfText>
<human>I have been known to erm, one time only, actually I can't do that, oh, but I do bath  t t t t <endOfText>
<bot>Granny razor.<endOfText>
<human>One like this, and I had a like gash about two inches up my legs.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I've done that.<endOfText>
<human>Go on, the other day,<endOfText>
<bot>usually it's me,<endOfText>
<human>did exactly the same, and I walked around with scabs two inches long.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, the first thing I've ever  the first time I've shaved my legs, I forgot the water.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I did that.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>I did it  as well.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll never do that again, oh.<endOfText>
<human>if you can do it out of the bath, so I thought, oh, that's it, get the razor <endOfText>
<bot>You don't need water <endOfText>
<human>It's going shh, like this, and it's exactly what I did, and my sister came in and she's going, what're you doing?<endOfText>
<bot>And I said I'm shaving my legs.<endOfText>
<human>It was just like, you know, I'm really grown up now, I'm shaving my legs.<endOfText>
<bot>And she said, but you haven't got any soap or any cream or anything.<endOfText>
<human>You know, just  oh, do you need it?<endOfText>
<bot>She said, yes <endOfText>
<human>Oh, it's a nightmare  girls.<endOfText>
<bot>The only thing is when you're doing it, you don't notice, you know three hours later, and you've got this raw leg and nice straight lines and you're <endOfText>
<human>In fact, stripy where you've missed bits.<endOfText>
<bot>The normal leg and the raw bits <endOfText>
<human>Yeah,about.<endOfText>
<bot>At my parents house, erm, in that, we've had an extension in there, so the garden's not there any more, but erm, I used, the light used to come in from the windows, so of at, at the angle to the bath, so I couldn't lift my leg up, so I rub it gently like this, and I'd watch the  told me where I missed bits and  <endOfText>
<human>Oh no.<endOfText>
<bot>The thing is, I don't think I would have shaved my legs now, cos I'd feel too guilty.<endOfText>
<human>I just cut my legs <endOfText>
<bot>Against your religion is it, Claire?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I've just had my legs waxed for so long,and people have said to me don't ever wax, don't ever shave your legs, because it will grow back thicker, and it will grow back prickly, and I, you know, it is fairly fair<endOfText>
<bot>Probably is true, it would grow <endOfText>
<human>and soft, but I mean, so now I just feel like if I  <endOfText>
<bot>that long, I wouldn't bother.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>But even so,la last night I got my legs wet, and I just went, Oh, never again, I'm just not in the mood.<endOfText>
<human>a bit of a pain shaving in the shower though.<endOfText>
<bot>What.<endOfText>
<human>I don't do my legs.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, don't you?<endOfText>
<human>dries them.<endOfText>
<bot>But I just do it very quickly.<endOfText>
<human>Sarah prefers shaving in the shower.<endOfText>
<bot>It seems so <endOfText>
<human>legs, sort of, bend down my legs, and you can't see  <endOfText>
<bot>I like shaving in the shower.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but you can put <endOfText>
<bot>I like shaving in the wardrobe I find it  <endOfText>
<human>Is that all, I'm glad I'm not the only one who does that.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos I find,a bit weird when I first started.<endOfText>
<human>Do you, do you shave in the shower, you never shave in the shower?<endOfText>
<bot>No, I started  it saves time in the morning.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, it's great.<endOfText>
<bot>It really is.<endOfText>
<human>You spend hours, depends, you know, how long, when we go in the bathroom, standing there doing <endOfText>
<bot>You take hours.<endOfText>
<human>Get rid of those damps spots  as well.<endOfText>
<bot>You do take ages.<endOfText>
<human>Those wax strips.<endOfText>
<bot>I can pull them off <endOfText>
<human>Do my contact lenses and you know, I'll bath, we'll both, we seem to be in the bathroom for hours <endOfText>
<bot>Mm<endOfText>
<human>absolutely hours.<endOfText>
<bot>I can't get under ten minutes in the morning to sha to have a shave.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, no.<endOfText>
<bot>to get a camera.<endOfText>
<human>adorable, wouldn't he?<endOfText>
<bot>What do you mean don't, I do, I do, anyway, actually  <endOfText>
<human>You've left your razor out.<endOfText>
<bot>couldn't we?<endOfText>
<human>you do anyway <endOfText>
<bot>The thing is, you can just get too paranoid, can't you?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>all go home now, at midnight <endOfText>
<human>Get the lawnmower out.<endOfText>
<bot>m m mutilating people  all these legs everywhere.<endOfText>
<human>Sorry.<endOfText>
<bot>This is such hard work, I find.<endOfText>
<human>I was, I think I was a little self disorganized the other night,add things  eight attacks, and all sorts of strange things,<endOfText>
<bot>Make up in there, yeah  <endOfText>
<human>Now I don't have time and I don't bother.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I was most  <endOfText>
<human>Thing is  <endOfText>
<bot>I just couldn't buy it any more.<endOfText>
<human>And reading those terrible things, that you're  for dead, and you have to get up at so many different times.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, lemon juice and hot water.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>a bit of cucumber on your nose.<endOfText>
<human>bathroom put your cucumber face back on and things like that.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, no, I can't be bothered sorry.<endOfText>
<human>Another boy went down, was so disgustingly <endOfText>
<bot>Well, I reckon that lot  yourself for what you are.<endOfText>
<human>Got a shower in, and when you were sixteen you don't know what you are  <endOfText>
<bot>Yes, get on with today, I need my breakfast.<endOfText>
<human>Make people accept you, but when you are a bit older <endOfText>
<bot>when you think of changing, don't you,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>and then you suddenly realize when you're nineteen <endOfText>
<bot>You are who you are.<endOfText>
<human>and it's, if you have a face pack, it's not going make you look like Audrey Hepburn anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>So might as well forget it.<endOfText>
<human>And just you know, it's ridiculous.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, isn't it, oh, sorry  <endOfText>
<human>Oh dear, we'll have to do something about this.<endOfText>
<bot>And even if you lose two and a half stone, you're still not gonna look like, you know, some skinny model because you're still gonna be about six foot wide with your hips and your shoulders, but I mean, you're just gonna have gangly longer legs and walk around like this.<endOfText>
<human>And be really unhappy because you've got  on.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, exactly.<endOfText>
<human>Very depressing isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>And you can't exercise, because you've never got any energy.<endOfText>
<human>Can't get out of bed .<endOfText>
<bot>My guess is  <endOfText>
<human>I think the answer is work an hour a day <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, for ten thousand pounds an hour or so.<endOfText>
<bot>And then they can hire a personal physician, or whatever they are <endOfText>
<human>To suck it all out.<endOfText>
<bot>to erm, yes, to suck it all out,it up, or <endOfText>
<human>Grow up.<endOfText>
<bot>Cellulite removal.<endOfText>
<human>Train them or something.<endOfText>
<bot>They see it all, anyway.<endOfText>
<human>is well over six foot tall,<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, here's this photograph with, of erm, Naomi Campbell's bottom in it.<endOfText>
<human>She hasn't got a bottom.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm surprised,<endOfText>
<human>Naomi Campbell's a pain in the a <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but a lot of people <endOfText>
<human>in trouble, isn't she?<endOfText>
<bot>Didn't she get kicked out by her <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, well, she said she, she told them where to go, and they said they  <endOfText>
<bot>Told her where to go.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>She's writing up, she's writing her erm, autobiography now.<endOfText>
<human>It's already out.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, is it?<endOfText>
<human>In that erm, in that mermaid outfit, and earning some ridiculous amount of money for an hour, while other models went up and down a catwalk for a tenth of the money, or something.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you remember, did you see that thingy?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Sat in that stripy, mermaid thing.<endOfText>
<human>you the other gest the other plate <endOfText>
<bot>Stupid, I don't see how anybody can earn, to afford that, you know, to accept that amount of money.<endOfText>
<human>With all, with the world the way it is.<endOfText>
<bot>It's disgusting.<endOfText>
<human>That's what we were saying today, weren't we, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>oh well, I support this charity <endOfText>
<human>Cos they do actually er deserve all the money they get.<endOfText>
<bot>Is this Cindy Crawford?<endOfText>
<human>Supports erm dodgy challenger.<endOfText>
<bot>They all support something.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, they all tend to be environmentally friendly, it's quite sick.<endOfText>
<bot>In Papua New Guinea or something.<endOfText>
<human>their parents, but it's like when they're modelling in their bikini and they have to go, oh, I love the environment and erm, I support this charity, thank you very much, and I love world, and that's it.<endOfText>
<bot>They just go backwards, and they er <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, yeah, I love you all, right.<endOfText>
<bot>They're not particularly<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>interested in the charity they support.<endOfText>
<human>It's a bit like Miss World, innit, and they never <endOfText>
<bot>They're, they're, they are not really there for their charitable concerns.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>They're just out to get the money, aren't they?<endOfText>
<human>They look wonderful in their bikini.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>And they like going on holiday  oh and a pretty tiara.<endOfText>
<bot>And I like a man with lots of muscles and  <endOfText>
<human>And they're the ones with yachts  <endOfText>
<bot>Get off me,<endOfText>
<human>That girl, erm, is it Kate Moss isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Looks like new, girl.<endOfText>
<bot>We're waiting for a model.<endOfText>
<human>She's just like a french stick, isn't she?<endOfText>
<bot>Who is this?<endOfText>
<human>Kate Moss, she's a New Zealand girl.<endOfText>
<bot>I wouldn't mind looking like that now.<endOfText>
<human>I must admit.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, come on.<endOfText>
<human>Er, she's horrible.<endOfText>
<bot>She's so ugly, Claire.<endOfText>
<human>Absolutely repulsive to look at.<endOfText>
<bot>Naomi Campbell.<endOfText>
<human>No, erm Kate Moss.<endOfText>
<bot>Kate Moss.<endOfText>
<human>Really, she's a <endOfText>
<bot>She's not  ten year old, is she?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah  supposed to look like that.<endOfText>
<human>I think she looks nice really, because she does look very young, she's only about turned sixteen, isn't she?<endOfText>
<bot>She does look like a girl rather than a woman <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>She's really young.<endOfText>
<human>She's got all these men leering over her, I just think it's really perverse.<endOfText>
<bot>But in a way then, they shouldn't, they shouldn't make such a big thing about all these skinny models, then, because, like, if you look at all these magazines and stuff, all these basically beautiful women are all like, you know, very, very thin, very very tall.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>That's what they seem to be going towards now, aren't they?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>For the blokes as well <endOfText>
<human>And if you don't fit into that category, you're just not accepted, and you're just like, ugly.<endOfText>
<bot>and so everyone like, wishes they would look like that.<endOfText>
<human>It's really bad.<endOfText>
<bot>It starts really young, with erm, toys like Barbie Doll, who's incredibly thin, and I think that's just disgusting.<endOfText>
<human>It's coming out beautiful and  me then.<endOfText>
<bot>All the men are like Kens,<endOfText>
<human>But it's just so sexual as well, you know, for children from four upwards, I just think it's really bad.<endOfText>
<bot>How far  <endOfText>
<human>No, that's true <endOfText>
<bot>And, look at Ken, I mean, he hasn't even got any genitals.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I mean he's <endOfText>
<bot>Ken though  <endOfText>
<human>No, I had an Action Man, because I got, I inherited my brother's  and his eyes went <endOfText>
<bot>It was, it was for the<endOfText>
<human>and his arms went like this  and his  aargh <endOfText>
<bot>And he had his scars.<endOfText>
<human>and he had his scars like this, and his ankle went like that, and his arms went like that, and  <endOfText>
<bot>He had a funny knee  as well <endOfText>
<human>He had a very pert bottom, though, didn't he?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, he had a  and they all liked Simon, and  note the hair, the role model, obviously <endOfText>
<human>hairs all over them, sort of asexual, they're not really any sex <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, exactly, and erm, you know  <endOfText>
<human>quite a good idea, like free, if you had to erm, speak to a teddy bear  <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, that's a .<endOfText>
<human>Coloured <endOfText>
<bot>Exactly,<endOfText>
<human>man or whatever.<endOfText>
<bot>Exactly, I mean I  <endOfText>
<human>teddy bear.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh my life.<endOfText>
<human>So I put teddy in the first <endOfText>
<bot>He's twice the size.<endOfText>
<human>Which is a good thing, innit?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>It's just stupid.<endOfText>
<bot>I didn't realize I was multi-racial  side of it.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know whether that, I mean surely that's what they mean, so<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I hope so.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>When even such as, you know, not necessarily black people find it, say black kid and black dog.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>But you know,.<endOfText>
<bot>I just think <endOfText>
<human>Sorry,<endOfText>
<bot>I was just going to say, I was just saying, that I saw the posters that erm parents and carers should erm, go along to talk about parenting  and at the bottom it said, erm, will be selling multi-racial toys and dolls and things like that.<endOfText>
<human>Do we need the .<endOfText>
<bot>people like, mm, I'm not scared.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, you do.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, when I, when I was a kid I got, erm, I was given an Australian doll baby, and which was funny cos it had an amazing sun tan and dark blue eyes and blonde hair, like typical Ozzie child.<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, great, that's really great.<endOfText>
<bot>Dazzling white teeth.<endOfText>
<human>And, presumably you had an Aborigine  I don't know, it's very odd.<endOfText>
<bot>But I think we should,it's like today, where was I, Battersea area, I think and it's the first shop I'd seen that actually had Chinese model manikins in the window, I thought they were sw pretty unusual.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, really?<endOfText>
<bot>There's a big Chinese er department store opened up, wasn't there?<endOfText>
<human>There is one in London, just off erm, Leicester Square  as well.<endOfText>
<bot>There's like only Chinese and Japanese people in the shop.<endOfText>
<human>We walked in, and we felt like going, sorry, as if we were like disturbing something.<endOfText>
<bot>We walked out again.<endOfText>
<human>It was really weird.<endOfText>
<bot>Is that that  one?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Is it erm, a hall, is it a precinct?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>It's like a precinct, it sells loads of bags and scarves and purses and all sorts of other things, and you go through the shop, like and that's the first thing you see.<endOfText>
<human>It's really strange.<endOfText>
<bot>it's just odd, isn't it, you just don't realize how<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>racist, our country is<endOfText>
<human>Yeah,<endOfText>
<bot>You don't think about having black dolls,<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>My mum, my mum was saying that erm, at Maria's playgroup, they were erm, they got, they got a ticking off, because of, they said to them you know you really should be introducing black dolls to the children, which is fair enough, but they also  <endOfText>
<human>Try that.<endOfText>
<bot>Thank you, that's lovely, that's great.<endOfText>
<human>which I thought was a bit over the top, they said that, you know, where you have  pretend foods, you should really have like <endOfText>
<bot>Oh, no.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>And <endOfText>
<human>That's not English food, I'm sorry.<endOfText>
<bot>No, yeah, I know, you know to cater for the <endOfText>
<human>That is, that is different, that is <endOfText>
<bot>ethnic origins, yeah, I thought that was a bit over the top.<endOfText>
<human>Well, my mum said it was a bit pathetic, you know, it's almost like, you know, erm, the <endOfText>
<bot>And who's gonna sell a fake , I'm sorry.<endOfText>
<human>What is it mummy?<endOfText>
<bot>It's a chapatti.<endOfText>
<human>Do you want them to play with like whatever money comes from those countries, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>But it's honestly, erm<endOfText>
<bot>No, I'm sorry, we've got to play with rupees.<endOfText>
<human>Rupees today, girls, and boys, sorry.<endOfText>
<bot>But then if you, if you <endOfText>
<human>Sorry  <endOfText>
<bot>sorry <endOfText>
<human>go into the Asian, if you go Asian community, it's amazing like,the sort of leftish area, or something.<endOfText>
<bot>How sort of, seven out of ten of the shops for clothes are just selling the saris <endOfText>
<human>To me <endOfText>
<bot>the women's, and like,<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>It starts in Bradford.<endOfText>
<bot>You're in an English country and how many of the actual English people will go out and buy a sari.<endOfText>
<human>I just think it, I just think it's so sad, like in London, it has so many cultures, and like, wow, it's really good for the cultures to mix, but it doesn't work,<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>because you have the Turkish in one, you have the <endOfText>
<bot>Yep.<endOfText>
<human>Jews in another, and then the blacks, and you just think what a shame, if they all mix and you feel like, when I was in erm, working in North London, you had the Turkish and the Jewish people<endOfText>
<bot>Golders Green.<endOfText>
<human>And then you had yuppies, but nobody mixed, and the feeling, if you went down to the Turkish  <endOfText>
<bot>In Golders Green.<endOfText>
<human>No, this was near erm, Stoke Newington,<endOfText>
<bot>Oh.<endOfText>
<human>Islington area,and you felt really unsafe, and I just felt how awful.<endOfText>
<bot>You know, here was a chance to er,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>mingle, learn so much, and you don't.<endOfText>
<human>I thought it was a shame <endOfText>
<bot>There's some coffee and some cheese and biscuits.<endOfText>
<human>And there's more wine as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh my God.<endOfText>
<human>If you'd like cheese and biscuits with wine.<endOfText>
<bot>Wine and cheese and biscuits and coffee.<endOfText>
<human>The coffee's in a flask, so it won't go cold.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, gosh, that's posh<endOfText>
<human>Can I serve any more coffee?<endOfText>
<bot>There's chocolates as well.<endOfText>
<human>Don't need to <endOfText>
<bot>Thank you.<endOfText>
<human>George bought them and you're meant to save them, and savour them tomorrow.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, we go out, after we're gone and you can't be bothered to eat.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>We had somebody round for dinner on Thursday and bought us a box of After Eight Mints and I think they lasted five minutes <endOfText>
<human>Really?<endOfText>
<bot>I stayed up all night,<endOfText>
<human>Do you want some milk?<endOfText>
<bot>Did you watch the film?<endOfText>
<human>studying.<endOfText>
<bot>So I ate them as well.<endOfText>
<human>What do you do then,<endOfText>
<bot>No, thank you.<endOfText>
<human>I opened a bottle of wine, I know this is a very strange question, but when somebody brings a bottle of wine, do you open that first, or do you open ?<endOfText>
<bot>Somebody once said to me they think it's really rude if they didn't bring wine to a, to a dinner party and then they don't have to have to drink it.<endOfText>
<human>Somebody else said, well no, if you don't open the bottle of wine immediately  it looks like <endOfText>
<bot>I said this.<endOfText>
<human>accept it <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, cos you brought a bottle round here, when  really weird.<endOfText>
<human>I think it depends.<endOfText>
<bot>Depends on how well you know them, I suppose.<endOfText>
<human>I think it depends, if, if it's red, whether you've got time to let it breathe properly, and if it's white whether it's got time to, to be chilled properly.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>What if it's really  <endOfText>
<bot>Charlotte.<endOfText>
<human>like a really cold bottle of white wine, would you.<endOfText>
<bot>You haven't opened a bottle of wine, you've got one there, and I've brought in a bottle of wine.<endOfText>
<human>Would you think, I have to open Charlotte's first, because they brought it,<endOfText>
<bot>If you brought a bottle of white and I got a bottle of white ready, if I hadn't opened it, I'd open yours.<endOfText>
<human>Would you?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, I would.<endOfText>
<human>If it was nice and cold or I'd put it in the freezer, then open the other one.<endOfText>
<bot>But <endOfText>
<human>Well actually, we put ours in the fridge before we <endOfText>
<bot>I, I think with four of you, you're gonna get through two bottles anyway, so it doesn't matter which one.<endOfText>
<human>like the other day, Charlotte, you brought<endOfText>
<bot>you brought, did you bring white, you brought a bottle with you anyway.<endOfText>
<human>Did I?<endOfText>
<bot>I'm sure.<endOfText>
<human>When I came round for coffee.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>When you came round <endOfText>
<bot>No, when you and Ben, I think it was when erm,<endOfText>
<human>yeah, I think so, and you brought a bottle anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm sure it was you who brought it, and we didn't open it because we were eating, we wanted to have the opposite colour to what you brought,that what you <endOfText>
<human>very much, yeah anyway, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>so we didn't open yours, and when you left, I thought oh no, they're gonna think we're really rude, because we still got their bottle of wine, and we didn't drink it.<endOfText>
<human>No, I didn't think that, you see I don't worry about that.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, that's good.<endOfText>
<human>We had somebody over for dinner, didn't we and they actually brought a bottle of wine, and we said oh yeah, well, cos we know him quite well, we said oh what shall we have?<endOfText>
<bot>Do you remember.<endOfText>
<human>And he said, oh what kind of wine have you got?<endOfText>
<bot>And we said something really really cheap and he said, oh what, I think we'll start with mine, then.<endOfText>
<human>Oh really?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, Richard, Richard  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah we were really embarrassed, he said, because I'm not keen on erm,<endOfText>
<bot>I hate that  I must say.<endOfText>
<human>ours is really cheap is it Aust is it Australian or Bulgarian or something.<endOfText>
<bot>It was quite cheap, though, and he said, erm, I think we'll start with mine, because I always find Bulgarian a little bit acidic, and we'd bought this bottle, and we both went out to the kitchen and both said gosh.<endOfText>
<human>That's really rude.<endOfText>
<bot>That's awful.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>And, he was really rude about it.<endOfText>
<human>The best thing to do, is like, they bring what sort of wine,yo they want, and then put some in the fridge and then just say, look do you want dry or sweet.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm sorry, does, does anyone want sugar?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, that's it, they wont taste the difference anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>Er<endOfText>
<human>Does anyone take sugar?<endOfText>
<bot>No thank you.<endOfText>
<human>But that was really embarrassing.<endOfText>
<bot>We went to some friend's house, erm, and I,th this was ages ago, I'd erm, done some wedding <endOfText>
<human>Claire, it's not too strong, is it?<endOfText>
<bot>No, it's really nice.<endOfText>
<human>put some more water with it.<endOfText>
<bot>I like it really strong.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't like <endOfText>
<human>I'd done some wedding stationery for a friend, and I'd painted two hundred and twenty pieces, er erm, sheets of wedding stationery for her, with erm, bud roses and things, I think I might have shown you one, actually.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Did I show you that?<endOfText>
<bot>I saw them, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And erm  at their wedding reception, they gave us erm, a trad local bottle of wine from the bar, erm, she got married in a bar and they, apparently they've got vineyards there.<endOfText>
<bot>Anyway, so they gave us a bottle of wine.<endOfText>
<human>We took it round to a friend's, didn't we?<endOfText>
<bot>For a meal, and like, we were really keen to try this and everything, and we, we didn't, we sort of kept saying, oh shall we open this bottle tonight, and they said no, we'll save it for a special occasion.<endOfText>
<human>So we thought, go see these friends, haven't seen them for ages, we'll take it with us, and they didn't open it, and we were really upset, because we, it was a present  <endOfText>
<bot>wanted to enjoy it and we wanted to share it with our friends.<endOfText>
<human>Share it with our friends, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So we went in the door, and just sort of said, yeah we had, we'd kept it ages hadn't we?<endOfText>
<human>And we said erm, we said, oh, we've brought this bottle, to er, because erm, and we explained, like whatever,<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, to open it, they, they just sort of didn't twig, but like, they're the sort of people that  wine, cos  Mark's  got a really bad influence on these people, he gets them  he gets everybody really drunk.<endOfText>
<bot>Everybody that comes into his house, sort of wobbl sort of wobbles out of the door.<endOfText>
<human>He's never short of wine.<endOfText>
<bot>He's never ever short of any  at all.<endOfText>
<human>He just keeps topping your glass up all the time, it's quite naughty, really.<endOfText>
<bot>Like your dad.<endOfText>
<human>Charlotte's place isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Alan's  pouring the wine out all the time, yeah, you can't keep away from it, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Nick's dad's like that.<endOfText>
<bot>My dad's awful.<endOfText>
<human>He erm, he bought a wine box in, when they were in France.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh that was awful, that was.<endOfText>
<human>And it was, it was really cheap, I mean, it was a sort of a rose and I think the whole box only cost him, one pound fifty, or something, you could probably run your car off it.<endOfText>
<bot>But erm, but he just kept filling our glasses up all the time, didn't he?<endOfText>
<human>I think that between me and him, we got through the, nearly the whole wine box.<endOfText>
<bot>And erm,<endOfText>
<human>Dad offers the wine  I mean, you don't notice, because he's like hovering around you so often,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, he sort of sneaks, sneaks round everybody when they're looking the other way.<endOfText>
<human>And after about seven glasses <endOfText>
<bot>I think he  from driving, I just, I just don't like,<endOfText>
<human>I got  absolutely  <endOfText>
<bot>dad was driving, and he was like when he can't  calm down, because my mum gets all like raged <endOfText>
<human>What do you <endOfText>
<bot>so he could've, then he doesn't, he doesn't manage give them any more.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Instead of buying us a present, from erm, my mum bought me a few bits and pieces when they went to France.<endOfText>
<human>My dad got Phil a big case of beers.<endOfText>
<bot>That was  wasn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Oh, yes, yes, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>That's great.<endOfText>
<human>It was brilliant.<endOfText>
<bot>That's a very good idea, actually.<endOfText>
<human>We decided, some of our friends from church we were going  <endOfText>
<bot>down here.<endOfText>
<human>and car, get the ferry over, and erm, just erm,<endOfText>
<bot>So we said to take Charlotte  <endOfText>
<human>oh no, we did didn't we?<endOfText>
<bot>It's possible.<endOfText>
<human>What are you gonna do about that?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I keep waiting for one of these free offers to come in the newspaper.<endOfText>
<human>Where you go for a pound.<endOfText>
<bot>The Telegraph.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Is it the Telegraph?<endOfText>
<human>That's in the Telegraph.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh it's the Sun as well, they do it.<endOfText>
<human>Really?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I don't care what newspaper it is, I'll buy it.<endOfText>
<bot>You have to buy seven yoghurts so then you can take your car <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>It's good, though.<endOfText>
<bot>I know that's good because we were all gonna go, cos I'm doing a French course last year at college, and we were going over with that one pound, you know each, with a car load offer.<endOfText>
<human>Who was that, they did erm, a trip to Holland for the last year, didn't they?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, that was quite good.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I, I wanna go skiing as well, so you get more than a day trip.<endOfText>
<human>You guys  <endOfText>
<bot>I think you'll be going on your own, Phil.<endOfText>
<human>You been before,skiing.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I've been lots of times.<endOfText>
<human>Did you enjoy it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I did.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I like it a lot.<endOfText>
<bot>I wake up and I, I think about it all day long.<endOfText>
<human>I just, I just have got to the stage now where I've been er, I can't remember it's five or six times, and I think, I'm not going to get any better.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, you are.<endOfText>
<human>I'm not.<endOfText>
<bot>It's ridiculous to say I am gonna get, like I  as far as like, grace  absolutely ludicrous.<endOfText>
<human>I would never ever ever look graceful coming down the slope.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, you will.<endOfText>
<human>Do you like going to dry ski slopes for lessons?<endOfText>
<bot>I think, no, I mean been, I always had lessons every time I've been.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, it's not, it's not <endOfText>
<bot>For the weak at heart  actually go, then I  when you got there  <endOfText>
<human>No, that's true.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I think the thing for me is I don't feel like I have to look brilliant, I just like to have a good time.<endOfText>
<human>That's fair enough, but I just, I don't know, I'm just feeling like I wanna go and visit places, I don't want to be stuck in the snow.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos, I have never never <endOfText>
<human>I used to be like that.<endOfText>
<bot>been on hol holidays.<endOfText>
<human>I've always been skiing with my parents, so I've been to America to visit friends, and that's not been like sightseeing, or something, and I just haven't been anywhere, and erm, I mean, I suppose I've been to a lot more countries than a lot of people who've, you know, there's a lot of people who haven't <endOfText>
<bot>did you say you haven't been abroad much?<endOfText>
<human>Did you?<endOfText>
<bot>I haven't.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>I haven't been abroad much.<endOfText>
<human>No, right.<endOfText>
<bot>That's alright.<endOfText>
<human>I've been skiing <endOfText>
<bot>I know a lot of people you meet, and they just say, oh no, I've never been abroad.<endOfText>
<human>But I'm, I can't say I've not been abroad.<endOfText>
<bot>I've been to lots of places, but I've never really been to visit countries and experience countries and, except for France, perhaps.<endOfText>
<human>I've been to Germany and Austria skiing, I've been to, er we went to Italy but I was, you know, I was quite a bit younger and it wasn't for very long.<endOfText>
<bot>So I've been to Rome and places like that.<endOfText>
<human>The sights.<endOfText>
<bot>You know, I've been to the sights, but I just feel like I want to go travelling, I don't want to go skiing again.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>I'd say, you might be on your own there.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, I do, I'd love it, if we went, I mean, I'd really enjoy myself, and have a really great laugh, cos that's what  <endOfText>
<bot>You would, you would, you liar.<endOfText>
<human>but, but, to me going, going skiing is just I mean like, it doesn't  there's nothing different each time we go.<endOfText>
<bot>You can have a good laugh with different people <endOfText>
<human>I think when you go skiing, you must go with a with a group of erm, group of people.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but you don't you don't need anything different though, once you get up in that mountain environment, you got this bright sunny morning <endOfText>
<human>Yes, but you could go anywhere in the world, skiing, and it will still <endOfText>
<bot>be exactly the same, whereas if you go visiting different parts of Europe and the world, you always have different experiences.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, you could pop up to Scotland for a few days.<endOfText>
<bot>Blooming cold skiing in Scotland though, isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>They won't even walk down the road <endOfText>
<bot>When, when you're skiing in the Alps,it's so hot,<endOfText>
<human>and you get, get such a lovely suntan.<endOfText>
<bot>That's what we want.<endOfText>
<human>Have you been, Julienne?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, there was a sunbed round the corner probably.<endOfText>
<human>March, he was, sort of, really brown.<endOfText>
<bot>in their school trips.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>When was that?<endOfText>
<human>Why isn't, I just love being in the mountains, I mean, it's just, I daydream about it so much  <endOfText>
<bot>We went to erm,somewhere in France,<endOfText>
<human>To do skiing.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, with the college  <endOfText>
<human>I love going <endOfText>
<bot>I know, ah <endOfText>
<human>to the mountains to climb and walk <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And that sort of thing, because then you're really achieving something and you see different places and you go different places.<endOfText>
<bot>Whereas, I don't know, I think just  <endOfText>
<human>going up and down the same place every day  <endOfText>
<bot>brilliant fun, I'm not saying it's not,<endOfText>
<human>You wanna go on a summer trip to Austria.<endOfText>
<bot>If someone said, you could go sk skiing free for the rest of your life, I'd go.<endOfText>
<human>I'd just think, absolutely excellent you have a really great laugh, but just wanna do  <endOfText>
<bot>Also skiing's bloody expensive, isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, exactly.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I mean, if we, if we did it with the free ferry, and there's a possibility we might be able to get fairly cheap accommodation if we drove over there and stayed.<endOfText>
<human>Really all we'd have to pay for is the fuel and the lift pass.<endOfText>
<bot>So you can have a week's holiday for <endOfText>
<human>Have you got the kit?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I've got boots.<endOfText>
<human>I haven't got skis, though.<endOfText>
<bot>You can hire them.<endOfText>
<human>You could borrow my dad's, though.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, they  as much as hire.<endOfText>
<human>You only have to rebind 'em.<endOfText>
<bot>Doesn't make any difference , and I could borrow my mum's.<endOfText>
<human>There is a big difference, though <endOfText>
<bot>You've been skiing before?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, we, I skied in Cyprus.<endOfText>
<bot>Because, you know, I'd never been skiing before, so I went out all togged up, with like, my tights sort of, like, you know, thermal tights and you know, pair of track suits, sort of bottoms, plus plastic overtop and then I had like, sort of thermal top on, plus the  that's a sort of like, T-shirt, plus the polo-neck plus a jumper, plus a sort of like erm, a sort of sheepskin waistcoat and, and jacket and then this plastic thing over the top.<endOfText>
<human>about fifteen pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>I was up going on the ski slope, and this is like, I've been up a couple of times before, but it had been really cold and bi and I went at Easter, I was so like hot, but it's still really good snow, and we went up there and I just couldn't believe it, I just went dad, erm, oh, I don't feel too good, and he just went, don't be so stupid, and Nathan and I collapsed, I was at the front of this queue waiting for the ski lift and the whole queue just went  <endOfText>
<human>And this bloke comes up to me and goes, hi, I'm a ski instructor, I was just like hmm  like, takes all my clothes off.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, great.<endOfText>
<human>But then, it's a big difference between skiing abroad and you know, like staying somewhere like Cyprus skiing in Scotland, it's true, but I mean, it's like the first, I mean, my dad's typical, sort of, get to the top of the hill and give you a good shove, you know, give you one time to go down a bit slowly and then after that you just get to the top  ski downhill phhhh.<endOfText>
<bot>And you don't really learn that much because it's just a matter of get to the top, and put your skis facing down, and <endOfText>
<human>Survival course.<endOfText>
<bot>survival course down and try not to take any trees.<endOfText>
<human>I've managed to erm, the first time we went skiing is when we lived in the States, we went to  like, er, not dry ski slopes there, but it was like false snow, that's the same as you  erm,they were really, was like eleven years ago, sort of like, technology hadn't quite advanced terribly much, you know, and these bindings, you had like, metal clips on the bottom of your boots, and you had to put the thing in and clip the boot, clip the thing round on the skis, to keep your boot on the ski, right, it wasn't like toe clips where you shove your foot,<endOfText>
<bot>I know, yeah <endOfText>
<human>and put your heel down and it clips up the back, it was like <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah <endOfText>
<human>clamp from the middle, and erm,I used to carry like down the thing and I just got really out of control, went all over the place, like skis up in the air  and one of them came off and the thing, actually, ripped off er, bottom of my boot.<endOfText>
<bot>Like this metal plate in the skis <endOfText>
<human>Oh, I see.<endOfText>
<bot>I couldn't go anywhere.<endOfText>
<human>I only had one ski, and I couldn't walk down.<endOfText>
<bot>So when my dad had to ski all the way down to the bottom, while I'm sitting on the side of this bloody slide.<endOfText>
<human>I was practically up at the top as well, I was really pissed off, just sitting there for like, for two hours, whilst my dad went all the way down to the bottom of this thing.<endOfText>
<bot>Got this man to come up with his screwdrivers and his this, that and the other.<endOfText>
<human>His glue, to stick the sole back one.<endOfText>
<bot>I tell you though, if you're gonna hurt yourself skiing, you can really hurt yourself.<endOfText>
<human>Because, I've, I've been in it, and I was like in these like, really tight ski pants, they're like a pair of like,like really badly, like sprained your legs.<endOfText>
<bot>And I went over, and I like, I went, my skis stayed on, and I like somersaulted over and my skis stayed on and I pulled the whole of my leg, it was black from just above my knee to there and it's like just black my whole leg.<endOfText>
<human>But because I was in like really really tight tights, er like and then a pair of ski pants over the top er, my whole leg was like, you know, sort of soaked in  and this bloke was there going, hee, that's pretty impressive and I was like, I'm not going to let him know I was crying  and like got up and went to the top of the slope  and I carried on skiing for about an extra half an hour, but like when I got home, and I just took off, my whole leg started, feet swelling as I took the like, the tight like leggings off.<endOfText>
<bot>I was just like aargh.<endOfText>
<human>It is really a dangerous sport though, isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>It is, it is dang and people don't realize how, they're like oh the snow's soft, but <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>if anything they're like a spray snow.<endOfText>
<human>So many people  <endOfText>
<bot>And the longer you get skiing really really piss me off, because it's the famous drink driver, it really is, I'm sorry, drink <endOfText>
<human>They should have big learners on the back as well <endOfText>
<bot>Honestly, it really is, is too dangerous.<endOfText>
<human>Ski plates, neeow, neeow, neeow.<endOfText>
<bot>When you, when you stop, at lunch lunchtimes, in the restaurant you get this big hot steaming mug of  mulled wine <endOfText>
<human>and it's just so moreish, isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but a lot of that, a lot of alcohol evaporates off of that anyway, so it's not that alcoholic.<endOfText>
<human>You just die in an avalanche.<endOfText>
<bot>I think I'd ski better if I was drunk, actually.<endOfText>
<human>I, I found I skied better in the afternoon, now.<endOfText>
<bot>Was you like, scared?<endOfText>
<human>I was petrified the time I went skiing.<endOfText>
<bot>Were you?<endOfText>
<human>Pick me up.<endOfText>
<bot>It took me fifty five minutes to get into those awful  to get up to the top.<endOfText>
<human>It was only a ten minute thing, and everybody, cos I was the last one, of course, out of us, a group of twenty, and was so like freezing at the top of this mountain, I wasn't exactly popular.<endOfText>
<bot>During the day ah.<endOfText>
<human>She'd missed about twenty  keeps coming along,<endOfText>
<bot>When Phil and I, the first time we'd been skiing together, so that was last, not last year <endOfText>
<human>Two years ago.<endOfText>
<bot>not since we'd been married, but, erm, and erm, it was in the March wasn't it, just before we announced our engagement.<endOfText>
<human>And erm, we hardly got to see as much of each other, because we were like, in this group of ten people, and then, and so like one time we skied off piste, and we just had this massive snowball fight off piste, it was like really funny.<endOfText>
<bot>All these  mouth full of snow, made you feel like, I was wearing, I was wearing er, cos it's really hot, I was just wearing er er, thermal fleece, and it was like the thermal fleece was actually covered with <endOfText>
<human>with it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Nightmare.<endOfText>
<bot>The time I went before that, I got erm, like a frostbitten thumb, because I was going up on the chair lift, and er, I dropped one of my gloves, and it was quite a cold day, so by the time I'd got to the top, and skied all the way back down, and then down the road going back to try and find me gloves, because I had borrowed them from a friend,<endOfText>
<human>Your hand had withered on you.<endOfText>
<bot>and then, and then I got to the snow, chest deep,<endOfText>
<human>Black  <endOfText>
<bot>so I had to lie down properly and crawl over the top of it.<endOfText>
<human>Ah.<endOfText>
<bot>I, I got to where, I got to where the glove was, and took me scarf off my hand and my thumb was just yellow at the top.<endOfText>
<human>Oh really?<endOfText>
<bot>It goes like a, sort of like a wax crayon, where it freezes, and I put the glove back on, and you get, you get the hot aches, I mean, when the feeling starts to come back.<endOfText>
<human>It's really really painful.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Er, a couple of days later, it just split down like a banana, and<endOfText>
<bot>Er.<endOfText>
<human>sort of pin, sort of half my thumb came away.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh my God.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, it was just, yeah, it was really disgusting.<endOfText>
<bot>What did it look like, later on,like heal the skin underneath it?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, it's like a brand new thumb underneath.<endOfText>
<bot>Four or five layers of sk skin,<endOfText>
<human>Er<endOfText>
<bot>sort of came off.<endOfText>
<human>How weird.<endOfText>
<bot>Look, no one going to have any cheese and biscuits?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you want some more coffee?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Is there much coffee in there, then?<endOfText>
<human>I can make some more.<endOfText>
<bot>No, no, that'll be alright.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>No, there is enough.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, don't, don't, don't go make any more.<endOfText>
<bot>No, there's enough in here.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, right.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you want any more wine?<endOfText>
<human>No thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>No one gonna have any cheese and biscuits?<endOfText>
<human>No thank you,<endOfText>
<bot>No, I can't.<endOfText>
<human>A drop more of wine.<endOfText>
<bot>there is some more.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, yes please.<endOfText>
<bot>half glass<endOfText>
<human>Oh, it wasn't as much as I thought.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you want some milk with that?<endOfText>
<human>No, it's fine as it is, thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, I'm not worried but <endOfText>
<human>Do you want any milk, hot milk any of you,<endOfText>
<bot>Whatever.<endOfText>
<human>Well, if, if I make some more coffee.<endOfText>
<bot>So you'll have to go back out and do that grinding <endOfText>
<human>Oh, that's a, that's a drag.<endOfText>
<bot>If I make some more coffee, who's gonna have some?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, I might have one, then,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah,<endOfText>
<human>Ben, are you gonna have some more?<endOfText>
<bot>No, thanks.<endOfText>
<human>Positive.<endOfText>
<bot>Nick.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I'll have one.<endOfText>
<bot>Hold on, it's worth making some more, I think.<endOfText>
<human>I'll have black <endOfText>
<bot>Well, would it, would it ready by   are you sure you don't want cheese and biscuits?<endOfText>
<human>Aren't you having something?<endOfText>
<bot>No, I'm not.<endOfText>
<human>I'll have some in a minute.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, are you?<endOfText>
<human>Cos I was gonna <endOfText>
<bot>I'll have some in a minute, too,<endOfText>
<human>Oh would you, oh, good, I'll leave it out, then.<endOfText>
<bot>I love cheese and biscuits.<endOfText>
<human>It's sort of, if it's gonna sit there, and get nice and warm and <endOfText>
<bot>Soggy.<endOfText>
<human>That's the way it should be, though, you should leave  cheese out.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, really?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, you should never  <endOfText>
<bot>Put it away to warm up, you know.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, fine, okay.<endOfText>
<bot>It's quite revolting, now, isn't it, and when they, like everything in the fridge<endOfText>
<human>that's really cold, when it comes out <endOfText>
<bot>I love the real sweaty <endOfText>
<human>Running everywhere.<endOfText>
<bot>Like to see the mould growing on it.<endOfText>
<human>Do you like it straight out the fridge, well, I left it in the fridge, first of all,said oh get the, get the cheeses out, and I said, no I want to leave them in the fridge, I want those nice and cool.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm like that, I'm like that with everything.<endOfText>
<human>I like it really hot or really cold <endOfText>
<bot>I like it fresh.<endOfText>
<human>Like milk,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I love a nice tall glass of milk.<endOfText>
<bot>Why does it have to be tall, that's what I want to know?<endOfText>
<human>It has to be tall to really taste nice.<endOfText>
<bot>In a tall glass.<endOfText>
<human>and say.<endOfText>
<bot>No, exactly.<endOfText>
<human>But, erm, unless it's freezing cold, I don't like it, but I just absolutely adore a cold, a cold long glass of milk.<endOfText>
<bot>But if it's the slightest bit lukewarm,<endOfText>
<human>Er,<endOfText>
<bot>it just makes me wanna throw up.<endOfText>
<human>It's true  it's the same thing.<endOfText>
<bot>I know, but it's, mm, it doesn't taste nice, does it?<endOfText>
<human>Okay, everyone, just stay where you are.<endOfText>
<bot>Do what?<endOfText>
<human>My dad came round when we went to the theatre the other day, he hadn't seen it, since we put that picture up.<endOfText>
<bot>Apparently,I don't know if anybody would know, you know, don't you.<endOfText>
<human>My grandfather was, is an artist and was head of Hull Art College.<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>And erm, yeah, and apparently his idol, as it were, is the guy who painted that,<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>And I erm, just picked that up in a garage some place, thought it was such a cool, I just really liked the picture.<endOfText>
<bot>Easily pleased, if you ask me.<endOfText>
<human>Shut up.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, no, it's just a joke.<endOfText>
<human>I just thought it was a really nice picture, so I bought it, and erm, my dad came in and said, that's spooky,<endOfText>
<bot>I know, my dad's going, oh, can't really believe it, you've got Edmund , I said.<endOfText>
<human>I hadn't even looked at who it was by.<endOfText>
<bot>Showing my ignorance, and then apparently my grandfather's so into him, that he went round trying to find this book of his, his work,<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>and then he went to a specialist book place, that can't find rare editions or whatever.<endOfText>
<human>Is it rare editions, or was it just a an edition of that?<endOfText>
<bot>Either a rare or first edition, something like that.<endOfText>
<human>And how much was it gonna be?<endOfText>
<bot>Four hundred pounds.<endOfText>
<human>Four hundred pounds for this one book.<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>Did my granddad get it?<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know.<endOfText>
<human>Is your granddad still alive?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Do you think I'm <endOfText>
<bot>He must be alive <endOfText>
<human>At your wedding.<endOfText>
<bot>No, that's my other granddad.<endOfText>
<human>The one who wanted to be in the film, when you were going cooee   granddad.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, that granddad lives erm, during the war, his father owns a erm, confectioner's business.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>So during the war, he didn't, he didn't go to war, he stayed at home erm, you know, he worked at, in like food and, and so they were <endOfText>
<human>Don't you wish you'd got an electric one now?<endOfText>
<bot>It's a bit of a grind.<endOfText>
<human>Ha, ha, ha.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh dear.<endOfText>
<human>It might look nice on the shelf, but it's a real <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>pain in the arse.<endOfText>
<bot>Actually, I have to say, we got it first, it's one of those, I think it's corny, you know when you do something first, and everybody else seems to suddenly do it, and they come round, and say, that's really a good idea, and like, everybody comments on our coffee grinder and since we come to like, the church, like, practically everybody in the church has now got a coffee grinder.<endOfText>
<human>Like, in our church in our church back home isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Is that a wedding Christmas card?<endOfText>
<human>Well, we bought it just after we got married, see.<endOfText>
<bot>Isn't it pretty?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah,<endOfText>
<bot>Looks, really nice.<endOfText>
<human>It's an antique, erm<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>It's a Peugeot.<endOfText>
<bot>Made by Peugeot.<endOfText>
<human>Really?<endOfText>
<bot>from Paris.<endOfText>
<human>From Paris.<endOfText>

<human>Really<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but it will last, won't it?<endOfText>
<human>I mean, yeah, I mean, knew they're that price.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah<endOfText>
<human>I've always wanted one, you know, the, the, the new names of the coffee grinder.<endOfText>
<bot>They make the new trendy ones.<endOfText>
<human>Do they?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but they <endOfText>
<human>Do you think ours isn't trendy?<endOfText>
<bot>Yours is very trendy, but you can fit the side of your kitchen units.<endOfText>
<human>Ah, like a like a mincer.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but it's a really, really weird thing, it's ever so heavy it looks as if it will be very hard to grind the coffee.<endOfText>
<human>But it looks really good, even if it doesn't <endOfText>
<bot>I think, I think er some friends of ours have got one like that.<endOfText>
<human>Really?<endOfText>
<bot>What  Welsh ones.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Very sexy.<endOfText>

<human>I must say I had a big shock when I married Nick.<endOfText>
<bot>No, it's Greg and you that got me on to saying that.<endOfText>
<human>Greg would be very impressed with the engineering on that.<endOfText>
<bot>And charz are carzy to them.<endOfText>
<human>Sexy to them.<endOfText>
<bot>Have you met Greg?<endOfText>
<human>You haven't met Greg yet, have you?<endOfText>

<human>I had to stay there.<endOfText>
<bot>Claim, claim settlement, two point eight pounds  <endOfText>
<human>leave.<endOfText>
<bot>shop, and there's two blokes.<endOfText>
<human>It was a Sunday, I was so worried, I didn't know anything about , and I just have to sit there and we had to make conversation.<endOfText>
<bot>Left us hours  about four times.<endOfText>
<human>Oversized tubing,<endOfText>

<human>And it's about two millimetres thick, and erm,<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Oh no.<endOfText>
<bot>Flattened but wide, and round, flattened all where the joints  just like the Eiffel Tower  <endOfText>
<human>and they're sort of chatting saying, well, you know, I'm an American  they were trying to chat us  <endOfText>
<bot>Movies, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>My, my brother is erm, is erm, manager of a  do a magazine called Cycle which is a new one that just's come out.<endOfText>

<human>Have they <endOfText>
<bot>and things like that  <endOfText>
<human>I didn't have time to leave the shop.<endOfText>
<bot>So I thought, well Ben  done a runner, so I'm gonna just sit here.<endOfText>
<human>thinking, where is he, and then he came back  I was so angry  made me sick, because  <endOfText>
<bot>yeah, I'm saving for it, right.<endOfText>
<human>I, I really would like a bike,so badly.<endOfText>

<human>Sorry?<endOfText>
<bot>That's alright, you're gonna  <endOfText>
<human>It's a rose, isn't it?<endOfText>

<bot>Do you think you're gonna run when you enter?<endOfText>
<human>Well, it's in this really little obscure  shop <endOfText>

<human>and they do a free draw every month for a er mountain bike.<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>Where is this?<endOfText>
<bot>I'm sure that's why I never win anything, I've got such an intent to win when I ever I enter a competition, like I dunno.<endOfText>
<human>I think if I entered in, thinking like if it was in a good cause,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I'll donate some money there, you know, I might even win one percent of the prize at the same time, you know, I might have a chance of winning, but I always think, oh yes, only fifty P, you know, I'll win certainly.<endOfText>
<bot>And then you wait and look for the post every single day.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>date in your diary, you know, the draw's happening on the thirtieth of November, and you know, er<endOfText>
<human>In fact, we just,<endOfText>
<bot>We<endOfText>
<human>I just think, you know the hundred thousand pounds.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, it's really bad.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>They have on these great big adverts, and you never win <endOfText>
<human>It's really amazing.<endOfText>
<bot>I've got money, money in premium bonds and I've never won anything.<endOfText>
<human>I erm, I admit it, because it just really shows them up.<endOfText>
<bot>You know that erm, have you ever seen, is it, I think it's I T V morning television when you've got Ross King,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>morning television.<endOfText>
<human>Good morning T V.<endOfText>
<bot>I was watching this <endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Well, I mean, only once or twice  and then,<endOfText>
<bot>Ross King was like <endOfText>
<human>I don't know, I don't watch it every morning.<endOfText>
<bot>Every day, isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>I don't even know what channel is was on, Charlotte<endOfText>
<bot>I bet you jot things down before I meet you.<endOfText>
<human>No, listen, listen  they, they have been <endOfText>
<bot>She records it.<endOfText>
<human>competition, to raise a trip to, to, to I can't remember where it was,<endOfText>
<bot>Don't have to get up now.<endOfText>
<human>to somewhere.<endOfText>
<bot>I thought, well I, I might as well phone in for it.<endOfText>
<human>So I.<endOfText>
<bot>If you don't want to listen<endOfText>
<human>I'm listening.<endOfText>
<bot>You were asked to phone in, so, erm, so our phone was out of order, so  I had a phone card  and it had four units on it.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, Nicole.<endOfText>
<bot>And it swallowed up my four whole units, because I even got to  say what the answer was  and I thought that was forty P, and I thought, I'm never ever going to phone into one of those things again.<endOfText>
<human>I've done it every week.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm not sure, but I just thought, I'm just paying for someone else to go on that holiday.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>That's the idea, probably.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Exactly.<endOfText>
<human>That's the only reason that they can afford to do it, and they make a packet on top of it.<endOfText>
<bot>It's like jobs, you know, that have O eight nine eight<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>whatever numbers, you're, you're waiting <endOfText>
<human>That's terrible.<endOfText>
<bot>and they're saying well  and they claim there isn't a job at all.<endOfText>
<human>But the only thing what, I, I mean, I got through, it says hi you've got through to Ross King's er, blah, we're going to repeat those competition questions for you, and they repeat it all to you, and they, is your answer A bla B  C and then, it's please speak after the tone, beep and then you say your thing and then, now would you like to leave your name and number <endOfText>
<bot>You didn't have time.<endOfText>
<human>and then it ran out, sort of like swallowed forty P, before I even got to say what my name and number was.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I thought great.<endOfText>
<bot>But then I, I still, erm, this question then, were you, were you with me?<endOfText>
<human>I can't remember I think it was Louise who br I went up to talk to her, and the question was,which of follow which of the following is not a swimming stroke and you have butterfly, breast stroke, bird crawl .<endOfText>
<bot>Wh <endOfText>
<human>and I thought,if you can't answer that question,<endOfText>
<bot>you really are fair sad y yo you know you shouldn't be in connection with the world.<endOfText>
<human>I'll repeat that,<endOfText>
<bot>The attached name thing.<endOfText>
<human>and they take it so seriously.<endOfText>
<bot>Which of the following <endOfText>
<human>are not a swimming stroke.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, the thing is, it's so simple,<endOfText>
<human>Terrible.<endOfText>
<bot>because they want everybody to phone in.<endOfText>
<human>Do you think that's why?<endOfText>
<bot>Forty five pence a minute.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, of course.<endOfText>
<bot>From each individual caller.<endOfText>
<human>That's how they pay for their prizes.<endOfText>
<bot>A, explain the erm,<endOfText>
<human>First caller of the day.<endOfText>
<bot>Get you to answer, that's the least thing  <endOfText>
<human>Which Tibetan country, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah Swindon  erm,<endOfText>
<bot>Tibet.<endOfText>
<human>Baghdad or Solihull, or something like this, you know, slightly more difficult.<endOfText>
<bot>This, see I just thought it was just cos, you know, and he kept stressing it, which of the following is  not  a swimming stroke, breast stroke, butterfly or  bird crawl .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>You know, you just think, why <endOfText>
<human>the IQ of the people who watch this programme.<endOfText>
<bot>You start worrying about yourself .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, why mum watches it.<endOfText>
<bot>Also another thing is, when you phone up, it's like  er you've, it's like on a time thing, so obvious well, not a time thing, but it detects whether you've said anything and how long the pauses are,<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>so erm, and it said to me, erm, say after the beep, and I didn't understand quite where the beep was, right.<endOfText>
<human>I know  actually.<endOfText>
<bot>They say speak after the beep, beep.<endOfText>
<human>Like you know, you're sort of waiting for it, and then there's this  now would you like, and I thought, I haven't given my answer yet, and then erm, and just leave my name, cos I think <endOfText>
<bot>Oh <endOfText>
<human>it's erm, please leave your name and number, and the  postal area code  and I couldn't figure out what they meant, your post code, or what, anyway, I sort, I, I left this long pause, shut your face  I left this really long pause, and it just like clicked off before I could leave my phone number, so they've got my, my answer and my names, but they haven't got my phone number, so I thought well, that's not much good, they can't phone you, can they?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, no.<endOfText>
<human>So you think, and so people must like do this, and then phone back, I'm sure it's not just me, because I can't be that thick.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>And so they get them to phone back, do you know what I mean?<endOfText>
<bot>Like they make a mistake, or I'd better phone back, and then it cost them all that much money again,more money.<endOfText>
<human>Bloody joke, innit?<endOfText>
<bot>You might have just seen <endOfText>
<human>through a really clever ploy there, Nick.<endOfText>
<bot>It's a bit like your story, ha, your novel you're gonna write.<endOfText>
<human>I'm gonna write a novel.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>What about?<endOfText>
<human>So sad, oh please, oh I shouldn't have said that.<endOfText>
<bot>It's really horrible, he was telling me about it last night, and I was really scared  <endOfText>
<human>Not this dream you were telling us about, was it?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, is this this psycho gardener?<endOfText>
<human>Oh, he hasn't told you about it,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I, I had this dream the other night, and it was so real, I thought I'd been to the cinema.<endOfText>
<bot>It's about this composer, who's a complete maniac, psychopathic serial killer, the works, and erm,<endOfText>
<human>okay, and his music, is sort of really  affected by this, and there's something really about this film, really dramatic classical music, and you know this composer and everything<endOfText>
<bot>Jagged Edge, the sequel.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, sorry, now erm all, all the way through this the, the, you know, is the usual business, you got this policeman, and you got the killer and you're trying to track, he's trying to track him down, all sorts of weird people keep getting killed and he's trying to track him down.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, eventually he tracks him down and kills him, I could probably stretch that all out.<endOfText>
<human>Who kills who, sorry?<endOfText>
<bot>The policeman kills the <endOfText>
<human>The policeman kills the ser the, this composer.<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>he's a guy, a, a well famous composer<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>and eventually he's the killer and he gets killed, right.<endOfText>
<bot>And, and the policeman, the, the film is just winding down, and everyone's going ah, you know, sigh of relief, and it's the end of the movie, erm, well in the novel, and the policeman is back in his house <endOfText>
<human>Whichever.<endOfText>
<bot>and he's just sort of pottering around,wind you know, things winding down, and suddenly the gardener rushes in from the garden, starts trying to kill him, and he shoots, and he <endOfText>
<human>Jagged Edge.<endOfText>
<bot>so the, so the policeman shoots the gardener and the gardener sort of, phworgh, falls onto the floor, dies.<endOfText>
<human>His, his personal stereo headphones get knocked off as he falls to the floor, and dinkly dinkly dinkly dinkly,<endOfText>
<bot>The music.<endOfText>
<human>you could hear the music of this psychopathic composer.<endOfText>
<bot>Ooh.<endOfText>
<human>Eerie.<endOfText>
<bot>Eerie.<endOfText>
<human>I dreamt the whole thing, and it was so real.<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>Were you in it at all?<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Really?<endOfText>
<bot>Nothing.<endOfText>
<human>He was, he was the gardener.<endOfText>
<bot>I've decided, it not  okay, it's the  <endOfText>
<human>I was watching it at the movies, I was watching the whole thing at the cinema.<endOfText>
<bot>What had you been doing that day?<endOfText>
<human>What?<endOfText>
<bot>What had you been going that day?<endOfText>
<human>I'd been talking to someone about the effects of music, cos there's a couple of court cases going on.<endOfText>
<bot>You should make it into a film, and I can star, I can be the girl.<endOfText>
<human>I was gonna say, this is, Phil's, Phil's going to direct this film, right.<endOfText>
<bot>And we're <endOfText>
<human>I could be the  I could be the er, F B I agent,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll be the psychopath, okay.<endOfText>
<human>Don't you think it's got some potential, though?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, if you could imagine the visual of all the sound, the big cinema,<endOfText>
<bot>If you've got a good imagination, if you've got a huge, imagination.<endOfText>
<human>laser guns.<endOfText>
<bot>It's got a lot  <endOfText>
<human>It would have to be really <endOfText>
<bot>Entered in the right  millions.<endOfText>
<human>Plenty of blood.<endOfText>
<bot>Plenty of blood.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, loads of, loads of erm,psychological  <endOfText>
<bot>Lots of gore.<endOfText>
<human>make it look really.<endOfText>
<bot>But I was trying to work out how, how, how the composer should kill them, whether he  <endOfText>
<human>Went into battle  through the heart er <endOfText>
<bot>did them with the piano  or, or whatever.<endOfText>
<human>Or did he deliberately  <endOfText>
<bot>What do you gonna call it?<endOfText>
<human>Baton.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Baton Rouge.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, dear.<endOfText>
<human>Anyway,<endOfText>
<bot>That's stupid <endOfText>
<human>Just about do that I think.<endOfText>
<bot>Big cymbals  <endOfText>
<human>Chippendales and everything.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>Okay, so it's only an idea.<endOfText>
<bot>Hit to death by the  <endOfText>
<human>We loved it.<endOfText>
<bot>We loved it.<endOfText>
<human>We can laugh about it now.<endOfText>
<bot>He's going on about it, even like, he told me that when he dreamt it,<endOfText>
<human>It's really bloodthirsty, isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, I know, and I'm really worried.<endOfText>
<human>I, I had another weird dream,<endOfText>
<bot>It's funny, I have been having really weird dreams over the last three nights, and I never dream.<endOfText>
<human>I haven't dreamed for years, and I was saying that to the girls, I had like, three nights of a really scary dream.<endOfText>
<bot>Vivid dreams.<endOfText>
<human>Really vivid, really scary.<endOfText>
<bot>I had this other dream once, of me, and there's this girl I used to like, right, and, and the weird thing was that in, in our group of churches, you used to sort of like, got one guy who's, more senior, and erm, he had this daughter and my mum sort of fancied me marrying this famous preacher's daughter, you see, and I took her out a few times, erm<endOfText>
<human>How old were you then, er, knows?<endOfText>
<bot>Sort of seventeenish, that sort of age  erm, and I had this really weird dream, that we were canoe canoeing up this river and erm,<endOfText>
<human>You and the girl?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>This erm, wide Am Amazon river, and suddenly all these natives start appearing along the sides, and we could see them <endOfText>
<human>all these trees with nipples,and these guys started paddling after us, sort of chop our nipples off.<endOfText>
<bot>That book sounds far better than the last one.<endOfText>
<human>What were your dreams, Claire ?<endOfText>
<bot>my dreams,<endOfText>
<human>Cos they're horrible?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>My erm, when I was little, I used to have this reoccuring dream, and it was really, really scary, and I just, I used to get really scared, I didn't want to go to sleep, in case I had this reoccuring dream, and what it was, was erm, I don't know, I, I think I didn't like swimming when I was little, so that might, what sparked it off, and I couldn't swim for ages<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know, I think I will, actually .<endOfText>
<human>until I was quite old, and then, this dream was, going to the swimming baths,<endOfText>
<bot>gets knocked over.<endOfText>
<human>and it being full of, of animals, most of them nasty animals, that would frighten you, like snakes and squirrels, I don't know why squirrels, and, and like I had a picture in my mind, I can't remember whether it was the swimming baths I'd been to, or whatever, like you know how they, quite often they have little ramps,or maybe they don't, but the ones I'd been to had ramps, stairs going up to them or whatever,<endOfText>
<bot>Mhm.<endOfText>
<human>and you go up this thing that winds in and out and like there'd be cockerels sitting on the, on the little fences you have to go round, trying to peck you to death, er  I was like only tiny, you know, it was just like <endOfText>
<bot>It's very good when you're little then you  you probably weren't very buoyant, so.<endOfText>
<human>really scared, and I just, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But I just used to have this dream, of all these animals, and I had to go in with all these animals, it was actually full, crammed full of animals, that were all out to eat me, and, kill me,<endOfText>
<human>Oh.<endOfText>
<bot>and have me for lunch.<endOfText>
<human>I used to, erm, you know like fairy tales <endOfText>
<bot>Fairy tales can be very horrible and violent, aren't they?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, they are.<endOfText>
<bot>They used to have these, I remember watching, erm, The Little Pigs.<endOfText>
<human>And erm,<endOfText>
<bot>How do you do  <endOfText>
<human>The cartoon, and I, I was only  I can remember, my dream was really vivid, I was standing up in my cot, and all of a sudden my bedroom windows flew open, curtains blew and in the window this bright light and then this wolf coming to get me, and it was the most scary dream I've ever had.<endOfText>
<bot>It was horrible, I was in my cot and I couldn't escape.<endOfText>
<human>Ooh.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh dear.<endOfText>
<human>After I got  there was this lorry chasing me, and I was always running <endOfText>
<bot>Lorry?<endOfText>
<human>Lorry <endOfText>
<bot>And it always woke me up as the lorry hit me, and it really hurt, and I woke up <endOfText>
<human>I've never had, I've never had dreams that have actually disturbed me.<endOfText>
<bot>I have.<endOfText>
<human>I've had some weird dreams, I used to wake up and think  wow that was a dream.<endOfText>
<bot>I've woken up  .<endOfText>
<human>I've woken up and found myself shouting and woke my, wake  woke myself up  I wake myself up.<endOfText>
<bot>I did that once.<endOfText>
<human>You're waking yourself up, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Violent kick.<endOfText>
<human>you really are running, you know how dogs' legs do this, cos they're running after  Ben's  and he kicked me last night.<endOfText>
<bot>I was just dropping off to sleep and you know how you're just thinking, yeah, mm what are we gonna do this weekend, and all of a sudden, Ben's legs went and kicked me really hard,and I thought oh my God something awful's happened, and you, you really do, you move a lot.<endOfText>
<human>You think as well, which is very irritating,<endOfText>
<bot>ask some of you this, but <endOfText>
<human>Who would like some more coffee?<endOfText>
<bot>Yes please.<endOfText>
<human>Anyone like some more coffee?<endOfText>
<bot>Me, me.<endOfText>
<human>first.<endOfText>
<bot>No, it's really funny, sit down.<endOfText>
<human>Have you got a cup?<endOfText>
<bot>Sit down a minute.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, what was I gonna say, oh Laura, Laura, and you say <endOfText>
<bot>No, no, nothing like that.<endOfText>
<human>So.<endOfText>
<bot>My grandmother has like <endOfText>
<human>How do you like your coffee?<endOfText>
<bot>Strong, please.<endOfText>
<human>My grandmother <endOfText>
<bot>Milk and sugar.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, this is good, I won't talk <endOfText>
<bot>My g erm, pressure behind the eye,yo fluid builds up as pressure at the back of the eyes,<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>and you eventually go blind from it, if you don't erm, don't catch it early enough.<endOfText>
<human>So anyway my grandmother has it and it's hereditary you see, so my dad's, my dad keeps saying to me, you know, make sure you get your eyes checked, make sure you get your eyes checked.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Now, I and I went to other day, I was having quite bad headaches from the back of my eyes, feeling like, you know, I had pressure there, and so, I think it was just headaches but I wanted to go and check it out, and I went to the, cos my dad said oh if you go to the opticians erm, they give you free checks as you've got glaucoma in the family, and erm, or glaucoma, or whatever you call it.<endOfText>
<bot>So I went in, and they said, oh yes, but they're free on the N H S, if you're over forty, so I thought great, you know.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I've got another twenty years to go blind.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So what <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, exactly.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, they said, I said well, so I've got to wait twenty years?<endOfText>
<human>They said well,you're not likely to have, to have it.<endOfText>
<bot>I said well, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Well, I didn't say this, but I thought, well I'm not likely to have it before I'm forty, but then, what if I do?<endOfText>
<bot>anything, are you?<endOfText>
<human>Exactly.<endOfText>
<bot>Anyway, so I, I was getting a bit worried about it, and, I can, cos I was having these headaches, and I started talking to Phil and I, I hadn't really said much to him about it.<endOfText>
<human>It was late at night and I decided, I was just sort of talking I'd say, I can't get rid of this headache, and I don't know what I'm gonna do, I don't whether I should just not worry about it cos I'm not that old,and I was really pouring my heart out to him, and he turns round and he says, yeah, you need a new clutch  you really need a new clutch.<endOfText>
<bot>I said, Phil,answers,and I said Phil and I started to laugh, cos I just thought, I wasn't going to get upset about it, so I just started to giggle.<endOfText>
<human>And erm, it was quite nice actually, cos I was getting really worried,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>and, and, so I was just giggling away,talk a load of rubbish, and  no no,you need a new clutch,forget it, forget it.<endOfText>
<bot>I just turned over and went back to sleep .<endOfText>
<human>would you like some more coffee?<endOfText>
<bot>And in the morning, he had absolutely no recollection of it at all.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Needs a new clutch.<endOfText>
<human>No, it's terrible.<endOfText>
<bot>I hate, it's so irritating because when I go to, to bed, I'm never tired.<endOfText>
<human>So I always sit up in bed for ages really wide awake, and I'm reading and doing all sorts of thinking like things, and I'd be talking to Ben, and he would say yeah, yeah, and he's really vague as well, and I, I get really angry and then I think you can tell because then you tend to lean across and say, are you alright, are you alright, and I just find it makes it worse.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Do you see what I mean?<endOfText>
<bot>I might, for Phil, for Phil to wind down, he'll come in, say we've been out for a meal or whatever, he'll come in and he'll sit down in front of the television.<endOfText>
<human>Now that to me is not <endOfText>
<bot>Only for five minutes.<endOfText>
<human>I know, I just don't how you can do it.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, whereas I<endOfText>
<human>Are you alright?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, sorry.<endOfText>
<human>erm, I like to talk, so he's wound down, you know, really sleepy, comes to bed, and I'm like, that's when I wind down by chatting away and saying, you know, little snippets of things that have happened to you during the day, and he's just like, oh, shut up, go to sleep, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>And erm, you know I want to talk and wind down so I now exactly what you mean.<endOfText>
<human>I, I used to get in the night, didn't I?<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I couldn't sleep.<endOfText>
<bot>My mum's like that, she gets up at<endOfText>
<human>Hours<endOfText>
<bot>two in the morning<endOfText>
<human>I used to get up about three,the fire, and things like this, and I used to get really bored.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos  you know, obviously nobody wants to talk to you at three o'clock in the morning, fast asleep aren't they, not much fun is it?<endOfText>
<human>I used to get up and read, and oh it's so true.<endOfText>
<bot>My mum wakes up and I wake up at two, because she's pottering around in the kitchen,, banging about a bit more than usual.<endOfText>
<human>mother are you alright?<endOfText>
<bot>And she'd say oh, yes  she gets up most nights now, in the middle of the night.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I know.<endOfText>
<bot>How many hours do you need?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, I go through stages, normally I need eight hours' sleep, always eight hours' sleep, but I don't really sleep in.<endOfText>
<bot>She doesn't feel sort of <endOfText>
<human>She goes to bed quite early cos she gets very tired with work.<endOfText>
<bot>So she goes to bed early  a couple of hours,<endOfText>
<human>Not really?<endOfText>
<bot>All she'll do, is she'll sleep through to, she'll sleep through to like six, and then get up and that's it for the day.<endOfText>
<human>I know.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos I just wake up in the night.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, if I can have twelve hours, then I'm happy.<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>But if I don't have nine I'm  not worth talking to, really.<endOfText>
<bot>We'll have to get a tablecloth.<endOfText>
<human>Nine?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Really?<endOfText>
<bot>You have to have a lot of sleep.<endOfText>
<human>I really need sleep.<endOfText>
<bot>Really<endOfText>
<human>awful.<endOfText>
<bot>The thing is, that I can go, for then, weeks and weeks with like six or seven hours,<endOfText>
<human>Yes, that would be great.<endOfText>
<bot>and then the first day I stop, I've usually got flu, I'm exhausted, I can't get out of bed, I feel rotten, but if I keep going for like, three weeks to a month, just on six hours, that's fine, but the first day I stop I'm like, in bed for a week ill usually.<endOfText>
<human>You stop  what?<endOfText>
<bot>Like six hours, seven hours sleep a night.<endOfText>
<human>I was saying, I need sort of eight, nine, and I could easily sleep for twelve hours.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, so do I.<endOfText>
<human>I could go to bed early and it's sort <endOfText>
<bot>So do I.<endOfText>
<human>I'm terrible, if I've gone to bed really late, quite, you know, I just can't catch up.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I'm awful, I mean, that's why I got up, you know when you phoned me this morning, and said, I am sorry, have I got you out of bed, and I was like really grateful, because I can't stand sleeping in.<endOfText>
<bot>I always used to sleep in, until we got married.<endOfText>
<human>Then he wakes me up when he goes out of the door in the mornings.<endOfText>
<bot>You were, you used to sleep in really late.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, yeah, I know, when I used to stay, cos Helen and I were as bad as each other, weren't we, though we didn't encourage each other very much to get up early.<endOfText>
<bot>Helen was terrible.<endOfText>
<human>Helen was worse than me, I  got up for Neighbours, I mean, she was really dead.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>if she could make it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, she does, she gets up in the middle of the day, doesn't she?<endOfText>
<human>Really?<endOfText>
<bot>If she's got nothing to do, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>But she doesn't so much now, cos she's <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>But erm, now I get up at eight o'clock every morning, and this morning I slept in till ten, but that's cos I was up till four, working on Thursday night.<endOfText>
<bot>God, what were you doing?<endOfText>
<human>Valponi Er,or not <endOfText>
<bot>I can't really stay in bed past nine o'clock.<endOfText>
<human>Normally eight o'clock.<endOfText>
<bot>In the morning?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I can't go to bed very early though, any more.<endOfText>
<human>I used to be able to go to bed early and go to sleep.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, cos I always used to go to bed a lot earlier than you guys.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>I say, the reason I think I had bad dreams, recently, in the last sort of three nights, is because they're the three nights I went swimming early, so I thought I better go to bed early.<endOfText>
<human>So I was in bed about eleven, instead of two in the morning.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Which meant I probably was  like awake to start with, because I, although I got up at seven, I still wasn't ready to go to bed at eleven, cos it was still too early, and usually I go to bed about two.<endOfText>
<bot>Body clock's sort of <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, my body clock was like, still really really active.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos usually I'm just like in bed, and that's it.<endOfText>
<human>and when I have to get up, I have to get up.<endOfText>
<bot>changed about midnight  whereas when I changed  go to bed.<endOfText>
<human>Charlotte I'm much better at going to sleep with noise around me, though now, cos I can't tell when by body clocks, tends to shut your eyes, so I just blot it out now.<endOfText>
<bot>I've managed to <endOfText>
<human>Been quite noisy upstairs.<endOfText>
<bot>Not quite noisy,<endOfText>
<human>Often they come in about half an hour after we've gone to bed, so you're still not quite  asleep.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Probably no difference <endOfText>
<bot>Well, that's it.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>tend to get used to.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I used to be constantly telling them  to shut up <endOfText>
<human>There you go.<endOfText>
<bot>I was a real pain in the arse, wasn't I?<endOfText>
<human>No, not really.<endOfText>
<bot>The worse thing is, when I, I am desperate to get to sleep, cos then <endOfText>
<human>You can't.<endOfText>
<bot>Because, because then you do, exactly, if they make any noise, I'd be like, will you shut up.<endOfText>
<human>And then that makes it even worse  because you go round and round  in circles, and you know and the more  <endOfText>
<bot>The more angry you get  <endOfText>
<human>Exactly  <endOfText>
<bot>and I used to get really angry with Alison  shuffling around, but they do it even, I mean, they've got to get their sofabed out every night, that sort of thing.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, right.<endOfText>
<bot>And so, you can imagine the sort of noise they make,<endOfText>
<human>Lisa?<endOfText>
<bot>people upstairs, cos they live in, they live in the space of our bedroom and bathroom.<endOfText>
<human>You're joking.<endOfText>
<bot>No,<endOfText>
<human>My goodness.<endOfText>
<bot>I know.<endOfText>
<human>What, and the, and <endOfText>
<bot>Wh where the ceiling changes height.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, where the ceiling goes up.<endOfText>
<bot>There's from there back to the bathroom.<endOfText>
<human>From there to the bathroom.<endOfText>
<bot>That is all they've got?<endOfText>
<human>That's all they've got.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, my life.<endOfText>
<human>That's just one room.<endOfText>
<bot>I know.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, I don't how they put up with each other.<endOfText>
<bot>So, when we, you can imagine the noise that they   I mean, it's not their fault.<endOfText>
<human>It's not being any more noisy than we are here, but<endOfText>
<bot>No, above you it seems more noisy.<endOfText>
<human>Exactly, and when they come in it's really loud.<endOfText>
<bot>You know about it.<endOfText>
<human>And they're traipsing around the room, getting the bed out, doing this that and the other.<endOfText>
<bot>We're amazed that we can hear the people downstairs, cos we can hear them like, you know, if you hear somebody above you, walking here dong dong dong dong, above, you can hear it for some reason, below on the ground floor.<endOfText>
<human>Even more, and it really, and if you are on your own,<endOfText>
<bot>They must have a sprung floor, or something.<endOfText>
<human>it really sounds like someone's coming upstairs.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>You think there's somebody on your level.<endOfText>
<bot>Cos you didn't always hear it.<endOfText>
<human>It's only<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>certain occasions.<endOfText>
<bot>smelly substances as well.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah their illegal substances.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, no.<endOfText>
<human>Smoking illegal substances.<endOfText>
<bot>They have, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I  coming up through the floorboards.<endOfText>
<bot>Perhaps they're walking on the ceiling, that's why you can hear it.<endOfText>
<human>I wanna go now.<endOfText>
<bot>You can really smell, can you  smelt it, Claire  <endOfText>
<human>I thought, I thought someone had been smoking in the toilets.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Is it?<endOfText>
<bot>Smoking  in the toilets, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I didn't like to say anything,but  <endOfText>
<bot>Well, when I came in, I thought, somebody's  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, probably in the toilet area, kitchen toilet.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh good, I'm glad we got that sorted out.<endOfText>
<human>I think, I think that, I don't think they smoke all the time upstairs, but like, in the summer, er, basically this place just had its windows and doors open all day long, every day.<endOfText>
<bot>And erm, one day we had friends round, and I went into the loo  it stinks of smoke in here, it was really bizarre, and I, I went, and sort of just thought oh, and then I went in again, and I really did smell, and I thought, this is really odd, and so when I came out here I said, did anyone else smell smoke in the ba in the bathroom, and they said oh yeah, I could smell cigarette smoke, and then, it must have just been upstairs, and it wafted down, and in through ours, cos there was no one else really around.<endOfText>
<human>It's just like really bizarre.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, it was really strong in the loo, just around the loo.<endOfText>
<bot>It was, really really strong.<endOfText>
<human>Especially in the toilet.<endOfText>
<bot>That's why,and they were smoking out the window, er, up here.<endOfText>
<human>I don't know.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>But I mean, sometimes  our house does smell,<endOfText>
<bot>friendly.<endOfText>
<human>And that's why <endOfText>
<bot>Oh, that's a shame.<endOfText>
<human>Sometimes,<endOfText>
<bot>I've never smelt it before, though, since <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but I always remember in, in the lounge there was, always seemed to be weird smells.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, that's when they came to change the curtains.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>This place smells funny sometimes, and I really start getting paranoid, sort of, spraying air, air re <endOfText>
<human>actually.<endOfText>
<bot>it's that kind of smell, he's into.<endOfText>
<human>No it does.<endOfText>
<bot>You know when we came in the other day, you came to see the sofa?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Didn't it smell odd?<endOfText>
<human>You don't remember?<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think so, no.<endOfText>
<human>Maybe it's just me.<endOfText>
<bot>You get paranoid, though, don't you?<endOfText>
<human>I don't like it being very stuffy.<endOfText>
<bot>But because when you got the, you think you got the heating on and you're paying for the heating, and you open the windows.<endOfText>
<human>It's ridiculous.<endOfText>
<bot>But I don't like it being stuffy, so this morning, I had all the windows open, cos it's nice and sunny and, erm, I had the windows open.<endOfText>
<human>But no, it's quiet, we can hear them down there can't we?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, surprisingly.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, can you?<endOfText>
<bot>But then again, we can only hear them at the moment, but there are six of them.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, that's true.<endOfText>
<bot>There's four.<endOfText>
<human>There's two <endOfText>
<bot>underneath the two couples.<endOfText>
<human>Two living in their, our lounge equivalent, and two living in my bedroom, equivalent, and then <endOfText>
<bot>I thought there was just of them downstairs <endOfText>
<human>There are, but they've got his brother, his, Sam's boyfriend's brother, and his girlfriend and then their friends as well and they're both, they're all Kiwis, they're, they're all over from<endOfText>
<bot>It's really sweet.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but they're all over them.<endOfText>
<bot>They're all gonna start to share, all gonna start sharing the place.<endOfText>
<human>They're all gonna start sharing the place together, cos it would be cheaper.<endOfText>
<bot>Is that why they're moving out?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, they're moving out at the end of this month.<endOfText>
<bot>We've gotta have them round.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>We feel really bad, we don't <endOfText>
<human>So they can leave us <endOfText>
<bot>We haven't met any of the other people that live <endOfText>
<human>How many flats are there here?<endOfText>
<bot>Thr four, including ou including ours.<endOfText>
<human>Well, we've met the guy who lives up above us, because he jumped out of bed, they've got french windows like we have, up above there, and he jumped out, and we were just sitting watching the telly or something, we heard these footsteps like going across the ceiling, it's as though we could see 'em, cos we could sort of hear it and feel it.<endOfText>
<bot>Real weird.<endOfText>
<human>And we nipped out there, and sort of looked up at him, and it was like, oh hi, we like go, is it safe up there?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>We had us some con weird conversations with this guy standing on our roof.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, we hear this television is .<endOfText>
<human>Was it, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you have to pay for your T V licence plus all the other flats separately?<endOfText>
<human>Don't know,<endOfText>
<bot>We don't need to pay, it's per household, isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>We don't have to pay for ours.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>But I mean, per household, do you have to pay?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, it's not  is it?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Individual.<endOfText>
<human>Bit of a shame.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>We think this is really disgusting, I don't know whether anybody noticed, but, on the back of the T V licence, we got our T V licence through, apparently  if you are registered blind, you get one pound and twenty nine P off your off your T V licence.<endOfText>
<bot>I know.<endOfText>
<human>Off, eighty three pound.<endOfText>
<bot>Big, big deal <endOfText>
<human>it's disgusting, isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>What an insult, honestly.<endOfText>
<human>Couldn't believe it, could we?<endOfText>
<bot>You'd think you'd get twenty five percent off, or something minimum.<endOfText>
<human>Get it free <endOfText>
<bot>One pound, twenty five.<endOfText>
<human>credit.<endOfText>
<bot>What, do they <endOfText>
<human>Do you get two pound fifty off if you're deaf and blind <endOfText>
<bot>and blind.<endOfText>
<human>Feel the screen.<endOfText>
<bot>Braille, braille television.<endOfText>
<human>horrible.<endOfText>
<bot>Charlotte, you gonna have some <endOfText>
<human>I can't believe it.<endOfText>
<bot>Sorry, I'm what, oh, didn't you know <endOfText>
<human>Erm, I was gonna say something.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, yeah, I was gonna say, it's not even just like listening to the radio, is it, because they're catering for the, for the sighted, they're not, you know, if it was on radio, they'd say more, but I mean, it's television, but <endOfText>
<human>Does it end up making sense <endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>television is a more visual thing<endOfText>
<bot>You could listen to the news on the telly and it wouldn't make any difference, but if you're watching a programme,<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>there's a lot of gesture<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>and, and looks and things<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>going on that you've missed.<endOfText>
<human>it would be a bit <endOfText>
<bot>That's a new thing <endOfText>
<human>It's not as if they could read the Radio Times and see <endOfText>
<bot>It's alright, leave it in the  we need some time .<endOfText>
<human>Erm, I got interviewed on radio once, on, on television once with a friend and they asked, they asked us what we did, and this friend of mine said we were radio mime artists.<endOfText>
<bot>Gee, thanks.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, no.<endOfText>
<bot>Like we're really going to be taken seriously now.<endOfText>
<human>What was this for?<endOfText>
<bot>That was with .<endOfText>
<human>What was it for?<endOfText>
<bot>Don't ask who it was with, they asked you what it was for.<endOfText>
<human>It was erm, it was one of these sort of things, where you could go on and record your bit.<endOfText>
<bot>If erm, if you got a thing that you're feeling uppity about.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, no.<endOfText>
<bot>it makes on our W T coding thing.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>The London Sport, or whatever it is.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but were you the sort of people that walk into hospitals and start praying for the sick to be healed.<endOfText>
<human>Really weird, honestly, when you, you really had the faith it would happen and it quite often<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But it's the fact that the guy gave erm, my friend Billy, erm, died a few years ago, erm, but they, they were like best mates and they used to ju just encourage each other to like, jump on a train and come up to London, and start going in all the hospitals and praying for the sick and things like that.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, they're really weird pe er not weird.<endOfText>
<bot>That's  down there in that photo with his wife.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, right.<endOfText>
<bot>Actually, before he moved away, he, he gave up his designing job and he was working in  for a bit.<endOfText>
<human>And erm, you don't know this, but when, when I used to go round there, he used to moan about all, no, he didn't moan, but <endOfText>
<bot>Oh you did tell me.<endOfText>
<human>What about all the girls.<endOfText>
<bot>The girls.<endOfText>
<human>The girls in campus, blinking heck Phil, they keep coming out in their underwear and saying, can you get me this size, or can you get me that size, you know, what am I supposed to do you know.<endOfText>
<bot>Keep banging his head against the wall.<endOfText>
<human>He was a great guy.<endOfText>
<bot>He phoned up, a guy erm, Head of er Air Canada.<endOfText>
<human>Top guy.<endOfText>
<bot>He found out the guy's name, right, he <endOfText>
<human>First name.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, first name.<endOfText>
<human>He phones up and he says, oh hello, can I speak to Tom, and then, and erm, this woman, receptionist, whatever, obviously thought oh well, he knows the guy<endOfText>
<bot>Yes.<endOfText>
<human>so she him put him straight through  and then  goes, Mr Smith, erm, my name's Mike , er, you don't know me, but I'm a graphic designer and er, my wife and I are trying to emigrate to Canada, and erm, I'd like you to send me some business and give me two free tickets for it.<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>And the guy did it as well, sent him some business.<endOfText>
<bot>He did a couple of hours' work, and he got two free tickets to Canada.<endOfText>
<human>Cos otherwise they'd never have been able to afford to go, so<endOfText>
<bot>Wow.<endOfText>
<human>And it took him about twenty five minutes.<endOfText>
<bot>How old is he now?<endOfText>
<human>He's now twenty eight.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, who was the one that died, then?<endOfText>
<human>Same age.<endOfText>
<bot>No, that's his friend.<endOfText>
<human>Really?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Blimey.<endOfText>
<bot>He was on a pushbike and he was sucked into the slip, into the strip blah, into the slipstream of a car  lorry  <endOfText>
<human>Ooh <endOfText>
<bot>But he, he built up his own graphic design business, by designing something, say, Quality Street.<endOfText>
<human>He'd look at that and say, I think that's a really outdated adve erm, design.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>So he'd design a new one, and he'd write to the guy at Quality Street and say look, I think, I'm a graphic designer, I think your box is a load of rubbish, I've designed this, will you pay me for it?<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>And he built up a whole business just by picking famous names and saying, look I think your design is really outdated and it's not doing your image any good.<endOfText>
<bot>How about this?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>I couldn't believe that he just about had the audacity to phone this guy up.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but that's how you get  <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, exactly.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, that must be a thousand pounds' worth of air tickets.<endOfText>
<bot>And they lost a fortune on their house, trying to sell it.<endOfText>
<human>And erm,<endOfText>
<bot>It took him twenty five minutes on, on his computer,<endOfText>
<human>So he just <endOfText>
<bot>and that was it.<endOfText>
<human>Fiddling around, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>He just gets <endOfText>
<human>Mm, if you don't know these things, if you don't try these things, you don't even  you always do it, don't you Claire, you're quite happy to barter with people in these situations  <endOfText>
<bot>It's the way we got our house.<endOfText>
<human>I think, yeah, I think you need to be sometimes  like that  are awful.<endOfText>
<bot>they saw our house Friday, and they rang me up, and I said look, you know, I've got, I've got my exams today and I really don't want to come up unless you see something, if you do, I will come up because they reckon it's a joint effort, if we're gonna live together, we've all got to see it and make a contribution to looking at the house.<endOfText>
<human>So anyway, they rang me up Friday night, and said, oh, seen this house, it's lovely and really nice.<endOfText>
<bot>What's the arrangement?<endOfText>
<human>We'll meet you there at twelve o'clock Saturday, right.<endOfText>
<bot>Right, I'll meet you at McDonald's blah blah blah.<endOfText>
<human>So anyway, we got down here,<endOfText>
<bot>eaten  sandwiches by then.<endOfText>
<human>and erm,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>when we got down there, and erm, rang the bloke and he wasn't in and we kept ringing and he wasn't in.<endOfText>
<bot>We just thought, they said, oh, we'll show you where it is, so we drove round there, and  no, he wasn't there, and, so of course, we drove back there about four or five times during the day, and like we drove past there one time and there was a woman standing outside, she said like, oh what do you want, I was like, oh well, we've come to see the house .<endOfText>
<human>So by the end of the day, I was like, look I've come all this way, which wasn't totally true, but I said, look I've come all this way, the bloke arranged that he would meet us at this time, and he's not here, and like, you know, I've come two and a half hours in the car, and I've gotta drive home again, and we were gonna have a look at the house.<endOfText>
<bot>So by the end of the day, we'd met Sam, we knew her, we'd been in her house, we'd looked around her house.<endOfText>
<human>We found out that the neighbours on the left hand side, who were in fact an elderly couple, and his son was working erm, and he had his own business working at home.<endOfText>
<bot>Then we had erm, the other people next door, the woman  erm, who was supposed to be a man-eater, we'd actually looked round her house and it was ident identical to ours and we looked, we looked all the way round her house and like, she said, oh yeah, all the building's the same but just in reverse and like, we met all the neighbours, plus the woman opposite  hadn't seen the flat,<endOfText>
<human>I mean, what's wrong  <endOfText>
<bot>Of course you can.<endOfText>
<human>so anyway  <endOfText>
<bot>You can actually see <endOfText>
<human>but then, on the other hand, I'm not the sort of person who, I mean, if it's something like that I can ask people, but I've got friends who are quite cheeky, who will ask things, I mean, like if somebody does something for me, I'm like, are you sure, are you sure, you don't mind, and like, I'm like over the top the other way.<endOfText>
<bot>But if you're just generally talking to people and not actually asking anything of them,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm very willing, but seeing as someone's doing something for me, I'm like you sure you don't mind?<endOfText>
<human>People get like actually annoyed and I just like what do you mean, I mean, you're doing it anyway, it's no problem.<endOfText>
<bot>My mum's the sort of person who'll just argue with anything, if she thinks  she'll argue with anybody, or anything if she thinks that she's being swindled, so like,she even went to the extent of having, they, we had an extension built, right, and she, we had it, only fair's fair, this one particular suite, we had erm, and they, they had this absolutely massive bathroom built,okay  not specifically to have a nicer bathroom, but to have a very big room and erm, so they had two sinks, this sounds real extravagant, erm,<endOfText>
<human>Is there another glass out there?<endOfText>
<bot>Where do you keep the glasses?<endOfText>
<human>Down, under <endOfText>
<bot>There's one there.<endOfText>
<human>In the front of the bar cupboard.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, it is yours.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, they've got two things, a bidet, a toilet, a corner bath and a corner shower on the other side, right?<endOfText>
<bot>Is this in one room?<endOfText>
<human>In one  room .<endOfText>
<bot>Goodness.<endOfText>
<human>I know.<endOfText>
<bot>It's, it's wider than this room, and it's easily from here to the end of the kitchen.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I see.<endOfText>
<bot>No, it's not.<endOfText>
<human>What a load of rubbish.<endOfText>
<bot>Philip, no, that's an exaggeration, come on, it's about as wide, it's as long as this room <endOfText>
<human>It's about that big <endOfText>
<bot>it's about as long as this room, and probably a bit wider.<endOfText>
<human>But it just, because they had it, they had our, our double garage and that knocked down <endOfText>
<bot>A quite big  <endOfText>
<human>It is isn't it  <endOfText>
<bot>The bath must be the size of a sofa.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, it's not that long, but it's in <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, well you know that sur with the surround and everything and if it's  <endOfText>
<bot>Oh, come on, let's not over exaggerate.<endOfText>
<human>Is this because they built onto the  <endOfText>
<bot>to have a big bathroom.<endOfText>
<human>Do you have to embarrass your parents  bathroom.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, what it was was, erm, cos my grandmother was very ill,granddad's sort of <endOfText>
<human>And they've got a, and they've got a sort of washstand in there.<endOfText>
<bot>Can I.<endOfText>
<human>Oh , for goodness sake.<endOfText>
<bot>How big's their  Claire.<endOfText>
<human>They had a double garage knocked down, and built around the area,<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>so they just had building built on top of it,<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>and my parents had,<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>because of that, they've got a very big bathroom and a very big bedroom,<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>because they just, two rooms,<endOfText>
<bot>Right.<endOfText>
<human>put over the top of the,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>yeah, garage.<endOfText>
<bot>So erm, cos downstairs, we had it all extended, so we could have a disabled bathroom and that sort of thing and,<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>instead of going  use the garage.<endOfText>
<human>I can't see the point of having a bathroom that doesn't work.<endOfText>
<bot>What do you mean, a bathroom that doesn't work?<endOfText>
<human>Oh, sorry, sorry.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you trying really to piss me off?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, what do you mean?<endOfText>
<human>It was a joke.<endOfText>
<bot>A disabled bathroom.<endOfText>
<human>Erm,<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, it doesn't matter what I was saying, anyway.<endOfText>
<human>Is this, is this  <endOfText>
<bot>We know what you mean.<endOfText>
<human>Is it separate from the bedroom?<endOfText>
<bot>It's not in the bedroom, it's<endOfText>
<human>Is the, the bathroom's not in the bedroom, is it?<endOfText>
<bot>This is separate.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>A separate room.<endOfText>
<human>What I was saying was, just that like, they had all these pieces of furniture in there, it was supposed to be a suite, but my mum, my mum got round and tell you every single piece that was a different colour or the wrong shape, or didn't fit on the pedestal properly, or this and that, and she had the whole lot changed at least three times.<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, and cos we had, we had the bathroom that was originally there, that they knocked through to build all this extension, was converted into a shower room, and she didn't think that the sink was right in that, and the disabled bathroom had at least two or three pieces that she thought bolshie in that as well,<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>and after just that they kept sending the wrong pieces, I mean, like they, they sent another piece to replace it, and it was it was just as bad,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>my mum wasn't having it.<endOfText>
<bot>Everyone else was just,everyone else could have all the faulty stuff, they may not complain, but I'm going to,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah,<endOfText>
<bot>I have to stick to my guns, I'm paying a fortune for this stuff, why should I have faulty<endOfText>
<human>Exactly.<endOfText>
<bot>furniture.<endOfText>
<human>Even if the whole lot's being processed like, perhaps it shouldn't be, and then of course your standards aren't good enough.<endOfText>
<bot>So sh mum's had a  my mother, but she's got what she wants.<endOfText>
<human>My friend had, they had er<endOfText>
<bot>It's taken a year to get it all.<endOfText>
<human>What's that big kitchen fur is it Schr Schreiber?<endOfText>
<bot>Schreiber.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, they had them come and fit their kitchen and they really did pay thousands of pounds for it, and erm, there was a chip erm, one of the units on the top and they, they just fitted it like it, and my, their dad called them back and said, look you know, I'm paying thousands of pounds for this.<endOfText>
<bot>That's  <endOfText>
<human>got quite a lot of money off for it.<endOfText>
<bot>They, they said well we can redo it for you, they said we can give you a reduction in it, and he sort of bartered with them, and I think he got, you know, a good couple of hundred pound off just for this little chip in the unit.<endOfText>
<human>I should think so.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, if you're paying for these things, and you know, fair enough.<endOfText>
<human>My parents had fitted cupboards and wardrobes, you know, fitted like throughout their room, it's like, the normal two cupboards on one side, the cupboards above, plus the extra fitting and like wall fittings and, then the back bits by the bed, and then they had stable door and the big long dressing table and the end unit, and they actually bought different side panels for different wardrobe fittings.<endOfText>
<bot>Like they got, I don't know, something called Shadow,<endOfText>
<human>yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>which was like sort of beige colour with gold erm, handles, and they sent a sort of bluey colour side rails and top, and thought they, they'd get away with it.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, they were actually looking at it and we were going, but it's not the same furniture.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>And they were like, oh, oh well, what you mean, you, you're not prepared to have it.<endOfText>
<human>And like my parents sort of went, the thought that they gave them money that we had for it, yeah<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, exactly.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, it's like you could actually, I mean once my mum had pointed it out, I'd never had noticed, but you walked into the bathroom and you thought, yeah,<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>they are different colours.<endOfText>
<bot>But like, obviously the bath and shower, cos they're plastic, they're not going to be exactly the same colours, so that's quite good, you can get away with that.<endOfText>
<human>But the two sinks the bidet and the toilet, were all like different shades, and you just like, yes, but is this all supposed to be the same thing.<endOfText>
<bot>yeah.<endOfText>
<human>And like, in the di in the disabled bathroom the, the er, it's not on a proper pedestal, so it's sitting on it<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>it's just got a bit to cover the pipes, so it just like, sits on the wall, so that you can get a wheelchair underneath.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>and it's much lower down, and this thing, it's like a gap, it's like  this big around the bottom of the sink, so like it wasn't even touching the sink, the, the pedestal bit under bits underneath, it's like, it had a sort of similar sort of shape, so it should fit, but it was like, a massive gap underneath, like  no   <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I think a lot of people tend to put up with things, don't they?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, they do, that's right.<endOfText>
<human>Don't like to complain.<endOfText>
<bot>When you just think, the number of houses, not everybody can go through that, cos otherwise they would have done something about it.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, that's true.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>In fact, to happen time and time again.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>It's like when we were in Cyprus, the amount of things that you can actually barter for.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you know what I mean?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>And like, they'd say, this was so much money, and mum would say, any chance of a discount?<endOfText>
<human>And I think by the time she'd finished it would be half price, she'd walk out with the thing half price, and she'd say, well you know, it's just, they make up prices and you go to another shop and it would be the half price marked, and you go into another shop it would be, you know,<endOfText>
<bot>over there.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>That's what their, that's the whole way they trade.<endOfText>
<human>Over here you know, it's marked up that, and you just don't dare to<endOfText>
<bot>But then the thing is that  my mum comes back here, and she's buying and she's like, any chance of a discount, and I thought mum, because she's like  so into that lifestyle, now,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>like the culture, but it's amazing how many people, even in England, if you do have the audacity to ask<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>they will say, oh, alright then.<endOfText>
<human>And they give a, though she's not being like, really cheeky, it's because she's been living in a culture for four years, where  that's the way they, they sell and buy.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>But because she's back here, she still sometimes does it, and in fact they do do it for her.<endOfText>
<bot>If I'm in a shop and I find something that's slightly faulty, and I think, well I could easily fix that.<endOfText>
<human>I go up to the counter say, erm, I'd like this please, but it's actually got this tear in it, or whatever's wrong with it, erm, can you give me some discount?<endOfText>
<bot>But a lot of places say, well, is there another one that's alright.<endOfText>
<human>Yes.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>And so, you <endOfText>
<bot>They'd rather sell you the full price, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, exactly.<endOfText>
<bot>say that about <endOfText>
<human>Some, some places say oh, yeah, alright then, I'll give you such and such off.<endOfText>
<bot>It's the big warehouse places, you know, the big stores that aren't interested, if because<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>it's all mass produced and they might as well not sell it to you, and send it back to the manufacturers and get a full discount.<endOfText>
<human>True.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Sometimes if you offer to pay for things for cash, you get a discount,<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>because they have to pay, sort of, two or three percent on <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, we did that, when you bought our erm,<endOfText>
<human>and things.<endOfText>
<bot>when we bought our chest of drawers.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>We got twenty five off didn't we?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But I think that was<endOfText>
<human>I never ask, I mean, that's really stupid of me, which I, I wish I did, I just always just, I don't know, I'm really stupid like that.<endOfText>
<bot>Never any harm in asking, though, is there, as you say  <endOfText>
<human>You ask.<endOfText>
<bot>Pardon?<endOfText>
<human>You ask.<endOfText>
<bot>Haven't really <endOfText>
<human>You remember  have you.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, that's the thing, I think it's the English attitude, of <endOfText>
<human>It depends, it depends on what it is, doesn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>oh don't, don't ask, because you don't want to look as if ,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>either you haven't got the money or you don't want to  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah <endOfText>
<bot>because people look at you, and just like, oh gosh how scummy.<endOfText>
<human>Well, it's just that,<endOfText>
<bot>But it's not.<endOfText>
<human>I wouldn't I wouldn't even think of asking.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>The best thing to get richer is like, going round car boot sales, like my mum, she's so funny, dad said she's a different woman, she's just like, cos when Phil and I erm, were engaged, we were trying to save up money, so we, oh and like we'd sell off all our old stuff, so just give me  of money, and then, we got these  and my mum was pricing everything up, and she's going, if someone asks for a discount, don't, just don't give it to them, she said, everyone's going round pricing everything up and erm, when they come to you, they just, they just want things for nothing.<endOfText>
<bot>She's going on and on about everybody wants something for nothing.<endOfText>
<human>And she's just like, this really officious and then, she just said, everybody goes round, and they try and get the cheapest price and they go back to the place that are giving the cheapest price, whatever.<endOfText>
<bot>She'd say, stand your ground, don't, you know, sort of like, then she goes round to everybody else, trying to get everything for nothing.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, exactly.<endOfText>
<bot>Funny, though, watching people,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>cos I mean, I had to help my dad with a car boot sale, this is a man who doesn't buy anything erm, secondhand <endOfText>
<human>People just turn vicious.<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>would only shop in Harrods.<endOfText>
<bot>And there he was at a car boot sale, it was like<endOfText>
<human>Well, it's amazing what people will buy.<endOfText>
<bot>I know.<endOfText>
<human>You get couples who shop together and then they get addicted to your car boot, and they want everything and it's quite amusing.<endOfText>
<bot>I've had people, I've, I've driven up and it's in the pouring rain, and you've people just, they hoard round your car as you drive up.<endOfText>
<human>You can't actually get things out of your car.<endOfText>
<bot>And you take out a box of stuff and they're sorting through the stuff and you're like, excuse me, and you're trying to get your tables out <endOfText>
<human>you know.<endOfText>
<bot>and your things put on,<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>and you know, all this sort of stuff, and they won't even let you get things out the car, I mean, they are in your car it's like  <endOfText>
<human>And then you all go round the car boot and they have their own car and they'll be selling your stuff out of it.<endOfText>
<bot>I've had people come up and buy records and tapes and things and they've gone back to their stall which is all they sell is records and tapes.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>and they've priced them up.<endOfText>
<human>Honestly.<endOfText>
<bot>They've bought them off yo them off you, say for three pound <endOfText>
<human>My gosh.<endOfText>
<bot>and selling them at seven.<endOfText>
<human>Crikey.<endOfText>
<bot>So you really have to keep an eye out.<endOfText>
<human>You gotta know what you're on about.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, exactly.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, I got wise to it after a while.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I had some guys come up, and they were, they were really pissed off with me because, my mum sort of like, this guy just done this with th th the stall next door, but he left some stuff that he obviously already had things of, which he didn't think it was worth him buying, and this guy came round, and they were obviously from one of these, you know how you get erm, secondhand erm record stores<endOfText>
<bot>yeah.<endOfText>
<human>yeah, actual, you know, shops that  and erm, there's these two guys together and they were really trying to intimidate me, I mean like, big stuff.<endOfText>
<bot>They, they priced everything up, and they said, right that's eleven pounds, what can you do me for.<endOfText>
<human>I said, I beg your pardon?<endOfText>
<bot>Said, well what price would you give me?<endOfText>
<human>I said, the prices are marked on the thing<endOfText>
<bot>That was provided by erm <endOfText>
<human>Oh yeah, it's really good.<endOfText>
<bot>It really picks up things very well.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, it's excellent.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, they're really expensive to buy, they're about ninety quid to buy.<endOfText>
<bot>You'll just have to <endOfText>
<human>what, those walkmans <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, 'cos that's got a radio you can use with it, as well.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>You can use it for an interview.<endOfText>
<human>They don't usually have record buttons, do they?<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, last night, I went through all the different topics, you know, the composer situation.<endOfText>
<human>And I went through them and I I narrowed it down to three  things now.<endOfText>
<bot>Task or topic<endOfText>
<human>What you were gonna<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>do in your essay?<endOfText>
<bot>Either that <endOfText>
<human>I thought you were reading the Alchemist or something.<endOfText>
<bot>I was, but I erm,<endOfText>
<human>Well, I finished that.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, good.<endOfText>
<human>Finished it all, and then, I just decided  then I sorted out my washing, and then I decided what part I was gonna do, I'd narrowed it down to either topic, task or topic erm, stable features, which are, sort of, erm, self confidence and things, and erm, how you you express yourself, and then a third one is like sex an and gender and age.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you have to do all this from the tapes that have been recorded.<endOfText>
<human>Well.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, you're meant to do your own recordings.<endOfText>
<human>If if not, you supposed to record, they're supposed to be, in fact, two minutes, and I couldn't read, 'cos two minutes is about half  two sides of of transcript, so that's all we need really.<endOfText>
<bot>So it's  otherwise, it would be just too big to analyse.<endOfText>
<human>Plus, all us, we had to do erm, transcribe  five minutes.<endOfText>
<bot>Well do you know how long that would,<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>can you imagine how long that would take, it would just be impossible.<endOfText>
<human>We were o on  and I thought, no way, and then Marianne said, no, it's ju , she said, that's too much, we'll be, and like, erm,, we'll knock off er, five hundred words of your assignment, if you do five minutes of thing, and that's, no way.<endOfText>
<bot>, really.<endOfText>
<human>you're gonna do well over five hundred words, bloody writing it out.<endOfText>
<bot>so Marianne well, she said, she said, well okay then, do five hundred.<endOfText>
<human>Like both sides, to do like two and a half pages.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I don't mind doing that.<endOfText>
<human>Thing is, they say, take half an hour to transcribe two minutes, but that's probably by professionals anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>It does, the thing is, if you've got a lot of speakers <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Becaus I mean, the the one I've got here,the one I've got, erm, er that I taped on Saturday night, there's seven people on it, and they all keep cutting across each other on it, it would just be impossible.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Was it a good conversation, though?<endOfText>
<human>Bet that was good though <endOfText>
<bot>The effects when listening back to it.<endOfText>
<human>How are you <endOfText>
<bot>It was just like being at the cinema, but it's just like being, it's just like being in the room again, because of the conversation's back.<endOfText>
<human>Was this seven girls, or  <endOfText>
<bot>No, there's there's  Phil, and erm, Nicole's erm, the girl she lived with last year, her and her boyfriend came.<endOfText>
<human>Oh.<endOfText>
<bot>So there's two blokes and five girls.<endOfText>
<human>And we, it's really funny because of we started off the evening talking about leg waxing .<endOfText>
<bot>The conversation keeps coming back to leg waxing at every quarter of an hour, it's really funny.<endOfText>
<human>Really.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Oh my God.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Who does it then?<endOfText>
<bot>And erm,<endOfText>
<human>I was telling my mum and dad about that,<endOfText>
<bot>No, everyone was bringing it back, it was, Ben  from bringing it back to it.<endOfText>
<human>And Claire did, and so did Charlotte, it was really  oh.<endOfText>
<bot>I I told my mum and dad about that on Sunday, that she's got a leg waxing machine.<endOfText>
<human>I said she had been trained properly, I was telling them just basically about Claire in general and just about the good of erm, things like  things you like to talk about, and erm, so I just, I said, they cried poverty, I said, but you know, one minute she's driving her old banger, and the next minute she's got a K reg and  outside the ,<endOfText>
<bot>And then I said, then she'd been bought a a hundred pound of leg waxing machine.<endOfText>
<human>Does it look good on.<endOfText>
<bot>I hope  <endOfText>
<human>She shares it with her mum.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think her mum uses it very much.<endOfText>
<human>'Cos I imagine it to be really sort erm, medieval <endOfText>
<bot>Hi.<endOfText>
<human>Hi yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>really, really old.<endOfText>
<human>I don't know, I I d , they're very expensive, I should imagine.<endOfText>
<bot>I wouldn't bother with one.<endOfText>
<human>Hi yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Have you seem them, then.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>How are you?<endOfText>
<human>Fine.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Arr.<endOfText>

<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>It's meant to be really funny,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>and it's meant to be a really good production.<endOfText>
<human>Is that the R S C?<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>

<human>nurses, yeah  <endOfText>
<bot>are you doing the same things.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, the same thing.<endOfText>

<bot>Yeah, we had to call it, Lear's Lily <endOfText>
<human>Lily <endOfText>
<bot>And, her  nurse.<endOfText>
<human>And I just kept quiet.<endOfText>
<bot>And erm,<endOfText>
<human>I just sat there and thought, I'm not doing it,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah,<endOfText>
<human>if they ask me, I'm not doing it, I'm sorry.<endOfText>
<bot>And erm,<endOfText>
<human>And I really like, really work psyched myself up for it.<endOfText>
<bot>And who did it in the end, who's doing it?<endOfText>
<human>Erm, Alice said she would do Lily,<endOfText>
<bot>So you had to ask actual  <endOfText>
<human>Oh, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>erm, and Martin and Den had already volunteered to be in it,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>and then, David, was so- sort of bludgeoned into doing it.<endOfText>
<human>oh.<endOfText>
<bot>David  Brush.<endOfText>
<human>David Brush, and we we're still wa we're waiting on a Lily, so I think we might be asking Naomi to do our Lily for u <endOfText>
<bot>I mean nurse <endOfText>
<human>er, nurse for us,<endOfText>
<bot>'cos we haven't got a nurse.<endOfText>
<human>Well, there's so  part, you know, what I thought, I really would like to do to camera, and I was a bit, thought, well, everyone's gonna want to do camera so <endOfText>
<bot>That's what I thought, and nobody wants to do it.<endOfText>
<human>Nobody wants, no,<endOfText>
<bot>and I<endOfText>
<human>I started our first one, and I said I would, normally I I put my hand up, 'cos I wanted to direct.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll do it .<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, and erm,yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>quite nice as well actually, because there's not that many shots, and there's a nice break between all of them, isn't there.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, and there nice easy shots, really.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, and erm,<endOfText>
<bot>Sounds cools, doesn't it.<endOfText>
<human>I wish I could have a go.<endOfText>
<bot>It is really  I loved it, I was really enjoying it.<endOfText>
<human>I thought, yeah, this is what I wanna do.<endOfText>
<bot>Have you got erm, you know you have the screen, and the monitor screen, have you got s , you know like they have on T V, the the writing that comes on, sort of, like a telephone number comes on the bottom of it, is it, have you got that, special things like that.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, you can do that.<endOfText>
<bot>What, what,<endOfText>
<human>You can do, you can put  you can put like credits up and you can put, you could put<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>a telephone number up, couldn't you?<endOfText>
<bot>It's just superimposed on the bottom.<endOfText>
<human>At the bottom of it, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>It's amazing what they can do, innit.<endOfText>
<human>In a way, I wish I was doi I wish I could equal acting on T V.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you?<endOfText>
<human>I really liked <endOfText>
<bot>I liked to do T V, I'd like to do camera work.<endOfText>

<bot>What's art and techniques, then?<endOfText>
<human>Living theatre.<endOfText>
<bot>The living theatre takes up, it comes up in the living theatre.<endOfText>
<human>The living theatre, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>whatever it is  <endOfText>
<human>And do we then stop our majors or what?<endOfText>
<bot>I would imagine so, yeah, I think, then you pick them up in year three if you want to.<endOfText>
<human>Which meant if I did it in year three, which I'd liked to, then you'd obviously equal  or went into drama.<endOfText>
<bot>'Cos I I like my English, I don't want to er, I don't know, I see how this year goes.<endOfText>
<human>Or m minor my English.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, it all depends how it goes.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, at the moment,<endOfText>
<human>I don't know if minor isn't, if if you minor English, isn't it just major authors,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, that all I w <endOfText>
<human>Is it?<endOfText>
<bot>That's what really pisses me off, 'cos I'd like to the whole <endOfText>
<human>Oh, really? that's what  I didn't know.<endOfText>
<bot>I wanted to fo major authors.<endOfText>
<human>But I would rather not fiddle around with other, I'd rather have not done tha well, no I wanted to do language when I when I put my options down, but now,<endOfText>

<bot>I was asking today in the English seminar, asking Mr Stevens if they knew about the erm, exam structure.<endOfText>
<human>Right.<endOfText>
<bot>And nobody knew about it, no-one  <endOfText>
<human>No, we haven't been told at all, have we?<endOfText>

<bot>I mean, I can't imagine that I'd ever want to drink anything  you know, erm,<endOfText>

<human>Richard and Judy, erm,<endOfText>
<bot>Oh God.<endOfText>
<human>I had one of those yoghurts last night, and they are so nice.<endOfText>
<bot>so gross.<endOfText>

<human>Yeah, but everything, all yoghurts are so expensive, aren't they, you know?<endOfText>
<bot>There's an offer at the moment  sixty four.<endOfText>
<human>So, I mean, that's not bad, but most of them are about one twenty for four, aren't they?<endOfText>

<human>And that, did they erm, set yoghurts as well, by any chance, 'cos I prefer set yoghurts.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>I hate set yoghurts.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think so.<endOfText>
<human>No, I'm not great lover of  <endOfText>
<bot>yoghurts.<endOfText>
<human>'Cos I just mash them up, first.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>No, 'cos I only like little ones.<endOfText>

<human>'Cos you look as if you're <endOfText>
<bot>I mean, you know  <endOfText>
<human>I look like a fly trap, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, it looked as if you were looking at my chest, and just staring at my chest.<endOfText>
<human>No, but I think you're just totally right.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, my life.<endOfText>
<human>I think that, I don't know, it just seemed as if you were looking at me like  <endOfText>

<human>My god, it's two o'clock in the afternoon.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you phoning her now, why don't you phone her at seven.<endOfText>
<human>'Cos I'll probably forget then.<endOfText>
<bot>I was just thinking, I'd phone now, to do something, 'cos I'm bored.<endOfText>
<human>And your money was going twice as quick.<endOfText>
<bot>Do some Alchemist.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>

<bot>I love  and Marmite.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, so do I.<endOfText>
<bot>And cucumber.<endOfText>

<bot>Well, I'll make it, it will really nice, won't it?<endOfText>
<human>If you just right, lack of motivation at the moment, I need to get a glass of Lucozade I think.<endOfText>
<bot>You want to  you know me.<endOfText>
<human>You think it really works, though.<endOfText>
<bot>Sorry?<endOfText>
<human>Do I think it really works?<endOfText>
<bot>Do you think Lucozade really works?<endOfText>
<human>I  when I've been ill.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, so have I.<endOfText>
<human>Lucozade.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>It just not a drink I buy.<endOfText>
<bot>Tastes nice when you're  <endOfText>
<human>Tastes nice when you're ill, but <endOfText>
<bot>What's <endOfText>
<human>everything tastes nice when you're ill <endOfText>
<bot>Just gives you a , does it?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, it's supposed to.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, I do find it nice when when I got flu or something,<endOfText>
<bot>I just <endOfText>
<human>it's cold, really really cold, really cold.<endOfText>
<bot>have you.<endOfText>
<human>Doing now <endOfText>
<bot>I'd rather do than sitting here.<endOfText>
<human>they started doing diet Tizer.<endOfText>
<bot>Have they?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, 'cos Tizer's the only one they haven't been doing diet, and I've been getting really pissed off.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I've got half a  in the fridge, actually.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, they do diet now.<endOfText>
<bot>in the fridge.<endOfText>
<human>But I've only seen it in some of the  <endOfText>
<bot>I bet it tastes crap.<endOfText>
<human>I bet it don't.<endOfText>
<bot>Tizer.<endOfText>
<human>Mind you, I don't mind diet drinks.<endOfText>
<bot>What, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>When we used to drink Tizer.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>We used to buy it in Safeways.<endOfText>
<bot>My dad used to buy it, always used to buy it on a Sunday evening.<endOfText>
<human>But I ne I'm going back years, 'cos I was on a diet, thinking, aw, I'm not drinking that, its got sugar in it.<endOfText>
<bot>But now it's diet, I'll now definitely drink it.<endOfText>
<human>Is it just erm, because it's got sugar in it, or because <endOfText>
<bot>I won't drink any diet drinks that are not diet if they're fizzy, because they've got so much sugar in 'em.<endOfText>
<human>You'd like teaspoon and teaspoons of it,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I just, the idea of eating that much sugar in er, just a glass of drink <endOfText>
<bot>That's why I think I'm really lucky, because I don't like, sort of fizzy drinks, I can't drink 'em.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, I love fizzy drinks.<endOfText>
<bot>I can't drink fizzy drinks.<endOfText>
<human>I only drink wine if it's fizzy.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm like,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, wine's is all.<endOfText>
<bot>and they had white wine, or, er, red wine, and I went, oh have you got any lemonade.<endOfText>
<human>Like, don't you want any wine, I said I I only really like it when it's fizzy.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>So I had some, Claire bought this Greek  wine, and it was sweet, and I <endOfText>
<bot>You know like, if I'm really thirsty, I could just gulp down a glass of water or a glass of orange, just like that, but with fizzy drinks, I don't know, I can't swallow them very easily, just sort of er,<endOfText>
<human>They're really good at  aren't they?<endOfText>
<bot>She's so fussy.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>No, you were fussy as well.<endOfText>
<human>What, what am I fussy about?<endOfText>
<bot>Fussy about everything.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, right.<endOfText>
<bot>About leaving things around, things not being left in <endOfText>
<human>I don't like a mess, but <endOfText>
<bot>No, I think I've got a right to be fussy.<endOfText>
<human>mm.<endOfText>
<bot>I'll just eat anything.<endOfText>
<human>You fussy about your tea.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I like my tea.<endOfText>
<bot>coffee  actually.<endOfText>
<human>It has to be not too strong and not too weak.<endOfText>
<bot>What Sam went through oh.<endOfText>
<human>So it can be weak, or  <endOfText>
<bot>If you do get a drink, she'll make a pot, and it'll have like one tea-bag in it.<endOfText>
<human>And like she'd pour it out and it's really really weak and insipid, and I go, oh,do you mind if I add a tea-bag to that.<endOfText>
<bot>'Cos she doesn't drink it with milk, so it don't really matter to her.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>'Cos my mother, likes it really strong, and you like it really strong,<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>but sometim <endOfText>
<bot>I used to drink really quite strong before, but I decided to give up erm, like, take less sugar, so if you take less sugar, I think I only took two sugars anyway, 'cos my tea was so strong, 'cos 'cos the stronger it is, you need more sugar to sweeten it.<endOfText>
<human>So I decided to give up one sugar and you know, I have to take it sort of weak weaker anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>It's better for me, 'cos there's less caffeine, and I drink a lot of tea, so.<endOfText>
<human>So it's better.<endOfText>
<bot>But I would try and give up sugar altogether, but I don't know.<endOfText>
<human>Well, you need to just give it up and  <endOfText>
<bot>I can't stand tea with sugar in it.<endOfText>
<human>I know.<endOfText>
<bot>That's the way I did it.<endOfText>
<human>Because, I I I <endOfText>
<bot>You can't reduce it and reduce it, 'cos then you're still depending on it.<endOfText>
<human>I did it with erm, with er, I went from one and a half and I'm down to one, 'cos I was, I I've tasted my father's sometimes, 'cos he thinks two and a half, he used to take three,and I'm like aw it's  <endOfText>
<bot>Er.<endOfText>
<human>My dad used to take two sugars, and when I said I was giving up sugar in tea and coffee, he reduced it to one.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>'Cos I think if I'd said, right I'm gonna give it up, I wouldn't drink tea ag again, 'cos I wouldn't be able to drink it, sort of without sugar.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>What about sweeteners.<endOfText>
<human>How about trying those?<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>It's funny, I thought about sweeteners the other day, I think it's just as bad as sugar, I think.<endOfText>
<bot>No, they're not, they got no calories in them, they've got something like nought point, nought, nought calories in them.<endOfText>
<human>No, it's not er calories, I'm thinking about erm, ruining my teeth, that's the only reason  <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah,in your teeth.<endOfText>
<human>It's not like putting a massive like spoon, if you think about it, right, if you have a spoonful of sugar in your tea,<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>it's just like drinking, it's just like getting a spoonful of sugar and sticking it in and wiping it around.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>You just diluting it a bit in the the erm, tea.<endOfText>
<bot>And if you drink as much tea as you say you do, just think how many teaspoons of sugar you have a day, extra.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>But I don't have any sugar in anything else, I don't I don't eat chocolate or anything, so that's a  <endOfText>
<human>have got sugar in.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I only drink, what have you.<endOfText>
<bot>Sweet and sour sauce has got loads and loads of sugar in it.<endOfText>
<human>You'd be surprised the amount of things that have got sugar in.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>You'd be surprised.<endOfText>
<human>All sauces and that, have all got a load of sugar in.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Especially things like salad cream.<endOfText>
<bot>My mother, she decided to give up sugar, I think it was about one year.<endOfText>
<human>Well, she just decided to give it u to give it up, she never used to take much anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>But erm, she used to take one in coffee and nothing in suga , I mean in tea, I think, and then she just gave it up, and she said it, she hated it for ages, and then one day she she tasted, she drank my father's  and she said it was absolutely foul  <endOfText>
<human>That's what I'm like, I drink sugar with it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>she going,horrible, innit.<endOfText>
<bot>I did that the other week,sort of going yuk<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>My mum drinks it black, so.<endOfText>
<human>What, tea?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Why's that?<endOfText>
<bot>She just always has done.<endOfText>
<human>All her family, like  they all just drink tea with a very little drop of milk in it, and she always drank it with a little drop of milk, and then, she decided not to drink it with milk at all.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>So she has two sugars  instead .<endOfText>
<bot>Sometimes, I've, I've had tea without milk, and it doesn't taste that different really, it's just  <endOfText>
<human>If you have skimmed milk, it doesn't.<endOfText>
<bot>like water anyway.<endOfText>
<human>It's just at the end it is, it's bitter at the end.<endOfText>
<bot>You know, when I've tried it without milk, I just don't, I just leave about that much at the end, 'cos it gets really bitter.<endOfText>
<human>I never usually finish my tea, down <endOfText>
<bot>Oh, I do.<endOfText>
<human>but coffee I drain the cup, but tea I don't.<endOfText>
<bot>I couldn't do that.<endOfText>
<human>I do.<endOfText>
<bot>My mum always used to say that, why haven't you drunk this little bit of tea in the bottom, but I never do.<endOfText>
<human>Just, you would always leave a little bit of tea in the bottom of the cup, I don't know why.<endOfText>
<bot>A phobia, I think there was somethin a spider at the bottom.<endOfText>
<human>social convention.<endOfText>
<bot>No, when, when we drink it at home, because  there are, not<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>not tea leaves as such, but there is  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, residue.<endOfText>
<bot>tea in the bottom of the cup, so it doesn't taste very nice.<endOfText>
<human>Because, I mean there is a difference between fresh tea and and er loose tea, and erm tea-bags, because there is  <endOfText>
<bot>Do you have tea-bags at home?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, we have tea-bags at home, but downstairs, the tea machine, you gotta use erm, well, they use loose tea.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, it is different, I never used to like the loose tea, when I was younger, but now I I sort of really taste the difference.<endOfText>
<human>I didn't, never used to taste as nice.<endOfText>
<bot>But now, I I like it, I don't why.<endOfText>
<human>Well, Auntie  had a tin of loose tea and tea-bags all day, like normal days, they drink tea=bag tea.<endOfText>
<bot>But if we go round there,and they get the china cups out.<endOfText>
<human>get the  <endOfText>
<bot>get the  drinks.<endOfText>
<human>loose tea.<endOfText>
<bot>My mum 'cos it's so much cheaper to buy them the more .<endOfText>
<human>No, we're not on the tea-bags this week,<endOfText>
<bot>What just <endOfText>
<human>I've just spent all my shopping,<endOfText>
<bot>so you've got tea leaves.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, it is it is cheaper to  <endOfText>
<bot>Oh, yeah, very, very much cheaper.<endOfText>
<human>Look at that.<endOfText>
<bot>You're just paying for the convenience, aren't you, really with tea-bags, that they're just all sealed, you know.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I suppose.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Not for anything else, really.<endOfText>
<bot>Still the same flavour inside.<endOfText>
<human>I tell you what.<endOfText>
<bot>No, I'm jut showing that I'm a bit bored, though <endOfText>
<human>Bit bored.<endOfText>
<bot>Tell you what is such a big con, was when the round tea bags came out, the round tea-bags.<endOfText>
<human>They're nearly all round now, though, aren't they?<endOfText>
<bot>I think that's such a con, they even had adverts  <endOfText>
<human>They they're erm, their better flavour for,<endOfText>
<bot>Oh,<endOfText>
<human>fuller flavour all round.<endOfText>
<bot>Er.<endOfText>
<human>I know.<endOfText>
<bot>What does it matter if it's in a square bag or a round bag.<endOfText>
<human>I bet if they brought it, done it in star shapes, people would go out and buy them.<endOfText>
<bot>I do prefer the round ones, though.<endOfText>
<human>I know it's stupid.<endOfText>
<bot>I do.<endOfText>
<human>I know it's pathetic, you know, I much rather have round ones.<endOfText>
<bot>They look nicer in the cup.<endOfText>
<human>My mother though, she's er, she's does, she's not fussy about loose tea leaves, but she's gotta have a Glengetti tea-bag.<endOfText>
<bot>She's a Thai.<endOfText>
<human>She won't drink any other tea.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, it's just the brand, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>It's the brand.<endOfText>
<bot>Never heard of them, have you?<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Glengetti?<endOfText>
<human>Welsh brand.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, is it.<endOfText>
<human>Yes, erm,was saying to me  <endOfText>
<bot>Could you send her down here.<endOfText>
<human>No, no,but erm, like  was saying, she doesn't reckon they are Welsh.<endOfText>
<bot>She doesn't think they are Welsh.<endOfText>
<human>With a name like Glengetti.<endOfText>
<bot>I know, that's what I said  <endOfText>
<human>Welsh, Scottish, or Irish <endOfText>
<bot>she says she reckons that it's Scottish, it's a Scottish brand, but you know, I don't think it must be.<endOfText>
<human>in the er, dark ages.<endOfText>
<bot>They are nice.<endOfText>
<human>Do your parents<endOfText>
<bot>But speaking to you <endOfText>
<human>I know you don't, sorry <endOfText>
<bot>Carry on.<endOfText>
<human>Your go.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, I know your parents don't really eat much sweet stuff, but do you have, generally have any sweet stuff in the house, really or is it <endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Like we might buy, my sister is, she loves chocolate, my mother would buy her packet of of Secrets or something, she buy a<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>six pack or something, but my mother very rarely buys biscuits or anything.<endOfText>
<bot>Really.<endOfText>
<human>Because we got biscuits downstairs, anyway,any way, so sometimes my mother has a cup of tea, and might just say oh go and get me erm, a Twirl, what are those twirl things.<endOfText>
<bot>Walnut, walnut whip, that's it.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, go and get me that packet of digestive biscuits <endOfText>
<human>I'm not a great eater of <endOfText>
<bot>No, none of us really<endOfText>
<human>We've always got sweets up in our house, but then again we've got young children.<endOfText>
<bot>They eat so much.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But what's the point in stocking up,<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>if you've got it all downstairs, we can just nip downstairs.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>That's true.<endOfText>
<human>Like if the shop was separate, if we had our own, sort of, house.<endOfText>
<bot>You just, you live quite a bit out of the shop.<endOfText>
<human>Do you get quite a stuff from the shop.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, we haven't got a fridge upstairs.<endOfText>
<human>Oh.<endOfText>
<bot>And I've been nagging my parents.<endOfText>
<human>At one point about three years ago, they said, right, we'll gonna buy a small fridge, so at least we can keep bread, milk, and things like that upstairs.<endOfText>
<bot>And  <endOfText>
<human>Yet you got a proper kitchen upstairs.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, we've got a proper kitchen, we just haven't got  <endOfText>
<human>With a cooker?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah  fridge.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, what a pain in the arse, you have to go downstairs.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>So, in the mornings,<endOfText>
<bot>Is there space for a fridge?<endOfText>
<human>Not really.<endOfText>
<bot>There'd be a space on the wall, perhaps small fridge, one of those small little ones, so you can just put the bare essentials in.<endOfText>
<human>But like, erm, in the holiday, sort of sometimes if I get up late, I'll come downstairs, and my mother's brought everything up, like the milk, the butter and cheese and br er bread's upstairs, but.<endOfText>
<bot>But otherwise, I've got to go downstairs.<endOfText>
<human>Or if my mother comes up, and I'm sort of just getting up, she says, oh do you want me to bring stuff up, or ideally, I usually say or I'll come downstairs and get breakfast.<endOfText>
<bot>But that's what I hate, I've got to go downstairs to get my breakfast.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, what pain.<endOfText>
<bot>Got to go downstairs to get my lunch, it's really  <endOfText>
<human>If you've got a kitchen, it defeats the object, really, doesn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, no, 'cos you you you go cook upstairs, we've got a cooker <endOfText>
<human>That's what I mean.<endOfText>
<bot>You've got to go downstairs to get everything.<endOfText>
<human>If you've got a kitchen upstairs, it defeats the object of you're having a fridge  <endOfText>
<bot>Unless you bring up and down the stairs.<endOfText>
<human>wouldn't you.<endOfText>
<bot>The thing is though, we've got erm, got one, two, three, four, we've got five fridges.<endOfText>
<human>You know, and and the one we use for the shop, for the kitchen, is just a converted drinks machine, so it's massive.<endOfText>
<bot>It really is big.<endOfText>
<human>It's a big huge fridge.<endOfText>
<bot>So we just keep everything in there.<endOfText>
<human>And like all the lettuce, the you know, all the foods that are usually used in the shop, we just use it for ourselves anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>It, I go downstairs and my mother will make a big box of of tuna mayonnaise, I just get the tuna mayonnaise box, get some suga , you don't  <endOfText>
<human>It's quite handy really,<endOfText>
<bot>We don't have our separate  <endOfText>
<human>yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>We don't have our separate stuff, sort of thing, my mother will make sort of, bulk of egg mayonnaise, like the other day, I thought, I'll make egg mayonnaise now.<endOfText>
<bot>Made two, erm, cooked two eggs, and it lasted me two days, whereas you know, usually if I go downstairs, I don't have to make anything, because all their pre-prepared anyway.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Still it <endOfText>
<human>Like usually the top shelf, is usually our own stuff.<endOfText>
<bot>Our own sauces, or whatever, erm, if my mother makes a cake, it goes on to the top shelf, but usually we just use everything.<endOfText>
<human>We've got bread and milk.<endOfText>
<bot>Ours is a bit like erm, Tesco's really, so much in it.<endOfText>
<human>Honestly, there's such a good su stock in our kitchen, you could live for a week.<endOfText>
<bot>'Cos my mum's got one of these people that always keeps the stock up, she won't let it get really low,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>she keeps stocking up every day.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah,<endOfText>
<bot>But what ha , what<endOfText>
<human>Aladdin's cave.<endOfText>
<bot>Stop scratching your leg.<endOfText>
<human>I'm n I'm just erm, just .<endOfText>
<bot>What I find though, erm,becau my, because we got so much stuff coming in for the shop anyway, like the lettuce or the fruit and veg, my parents don , you know, like most people go,yo your mother probably goes, how many, how often does she make a shopping trip?<endOfText>
<human>Probably gets something every day.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, like, you know, not to be  <endOfText>
<human>My mum, erm, once every two weeks.<endOfText>
<bot>See, my parents hardly ever go.<endOfText>
<human>My father will go to the cash and carry every week, and perhaps he'll pop into into Tesco's or something and get a few bits and pieces, so we got a lot in the fridge, but it's not a lot of variety.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>So, erm, you know, my mother like, if she, if she needs something, she just asks me just to pop to erm, Gateways.<endOfText>
<bot>Occasionally my parents will go to Tesco's and then it's not like, with lots of people probably spend about a hundred pound, even more probably, wouldn't they?<endOfText>
<human>But you know, my parents would pay, probably spend about thirty or something.<endOfText>
<bot>Wouldn't spend a lot.<endOfText>
<human>And Kerry at home, young girl whom I'm going to see erm, take that with, like you look into her freezer, she's got a big freezer like that, and they've got so much frozen foods, and you look into ours, we've got the one the same size, but it's just basically frozen vegetables, so you know.<endOfText>
<bot>We've got .<endOfText>
<human>Everything's frozen basically in our house.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, she does buy vegetables, but she'd rather buy frozen veg, 'cos it's just easy for her, dead easy for her.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, it is easy, yeah<endOfText>
<bot>Probably erm, it's probably nicer 'cos it's it's it's frozen straight away after it's been picked, innit?<endOfText>
<human>So it's probably fresher.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm, they say that, don't they about frozen veg.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>They say it gives er flavour more.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>You know, some people, just don't like buying them, do they?<endOfText>
<human>They don't buy frozen vegetables.<endOfText>
<bot>They'd rather cook it fresh.<endOfText>
<human>No, they got <endOfText>
<bot>They won't like Kerry's house.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>We got to use them up like <endOfText>
<human>Yeah?<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Well, there used to be a fridge/freezer at the bottom of the stairs.<endOfText>
<bot>But the freezer kept freezing up, and er, we've had it since we left Sussex anyway.<endOfText>
<human>It would be fourteen years old now.<endOfText>
<bot>Bloody hell.<endOfText>
<human>Coming up for fifteen years old.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, so like they just took all the fridge<endOfText>
<human>Part,<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>the erm, the bar, the like the dining bar <endOfText>
<bot>And er, keep the lemons and things in it, and then, the freezer is just for  and when there was like a  of stuff at Christmas, they put stuff in it from downstairs,<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>but  freezers anyway.<endOfText>
<human>And erm, we got a big, er huge chest freezer.<endOfText>
<bot>Deep freezer, downstairs in the cellar.<endOfText>
<human>Do you stock some, at all for yourself?<endOfText>
<bot>Do you ever use any fridge/freezers.<endOfText>
<human>No,fridge/freezer so it's down two flights of stairs.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't know, it's just a pain in the arse.<endOfText>
<human>But we've never really eaten that much frozen food anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>Mum's never had that much stuff in the freezer.<endOfText>
<human>When I used to buy stuff from M and S, from the staff shop.<endOfText>
<bot>We'd stick it in the freezer that we've got downstairs.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>But you know, we just don't need frozen <endOfText>
<human>'Cos, yeah, it's just vegetables we keep because erm, or if my mother makes sort of a lot of curries or things.<endOfText>
<bot>Or or tomato sauce for the pasta, she'll freeze it in indiv individual portions, but Kerry at home like, they've got some real frozen meals, and they do do rely heavily on convenience foods, which we don't really.<endOfText>
<human>But you know you were saying that your fridge was fifteen years old, that one.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, we got at the back of th the erm, shop there's  we got this room and it's got this walk-in freezer erm fridge, and<endOfText>
<human>Walk-in?<endOfText>
<bot>Ye yeah it kinda just walk.<endOfText>
<human>It literally clogs around.<endOfText>
<bot>you just walk in  and like, it was there and I would have said it was old when we arrived, and we've been there nineteen perhaps twenty years.<endOfText>
<human>Bloody hell, and it's still going.<endOfText>
<bot>It's huge, it's so big.<endOfText>
<human>And do you you use it.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, used.<endOfText>
<human>And you've still got another five fridges.<endOfText>
<bot>We got a big one where erm, sort of, it's really cold, and so we keep erm, the longest dates and everything erm, that we don't need immediately, and then, we got the fridge/freezer, we got the freezer in the stock-room, which is ours, we we just bought it,wh , my parents bought it about three years ago, for ourselves.<endOfText>
<human>Then we got the big fridge in the kitchen for all the foods like we use every day, then we got erm, oh w no, we got six fridges, and then we got the pie fridge, got all the p pies and put the cakes in as well, and we got another deep freeze.<endOfText>
<bot>We keep the ice-cream and at the pa the pizzas and the ready meals that we cook.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, you got quite a variety of foods.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, quite a variety, and then we got the drinks machines.<endOfText>
<human>Do you do desserts?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, apple tart, but you know, things we bring in, apple tarts erm, custard slices,a the occasional eclair erm, yeah, we do quite a range, actually.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Yes, we got six freezers, one, two, three, four, five, six, you know for, it's not that big   it's quite a lot, really.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, we got a lot of storage space, but, because we get deliveries three days, three times a week,<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>you know.<endOfText>
<human>Don't we don't hold a lot of stuff for any period of time,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>because it's all just coming in and going straight out again.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>'Cos,<endOfText>
<bot>Like the ice-cream and stuff, I mean, you know, ice-cream a box of ice-cream won't be there more than a week.<endOfText>
<human>'Cos erm like <endOfText>
<bot>Like their individual portions.<endOfText>
<human>So erm, you know, it's there that, although we've got a lot of storage space,<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>The turn-over of food and the selling of food, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean,<endOfText>
<human>Things obviously, like herbs and stuff  Steve only orders once in a blue moon.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>And and like the dry store, erm, with all, it's got like the rice in it, the custard in it, all those sorts of things, I mean, you know, he might order that stuff once a week, rather than having it come in three days a week.<endOfText>
<human>But then, there might be joints of meat and the ice-cream and all the desserts and all the all, I mean, we have had fresh veg, we're not allowed to put peas on the carvery.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Had to have six fresh veg on the carvery<endOfText>
<bot>Do you?<endOfText>
<human>at all times.<endOfText>
<bot>That's hard going then, isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>, that's hard work, you know, you have to prepare all that veg, and  <endOfText>
<bot>And so, if<endOfText>
<human>So if<endOfText>
<bot>So if erm, if they're not used, they've got to be thrown away, they can't be sort of used again the next day, the veg.<endOfText>
<human>Well, most veg you couldn't use couldn't use up, could you.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>I don't suppose.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, you just have to control it,<endOfText>
<human>You don't cook, you don't cook as much as you need, you might have your potatoes prep but you don't cook them if you don't need them.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Erm, you know, if they're sitting there in water and they've been peeled and they're ready to cook, they won't be cooked until they're needed to be cooked, you know.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>And erm, oh well, you know, they might have cauliflower cheese prepared to to put out, you know, they might.<endOfText>
<bot>Say they needed it at eight, they thought they might need it at eight o'clock and then turned out they didn't, because one body else came in the restaurant, then they'd just stick that in the fridge over night, and put it out the next morning.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>But, like if it's been out on the deck, the only things off the deck that they can save, is like Ratatouille, they save that, erm, and like  but it's unused <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>nothing else really.<endOfText>
<human>everything else has to be thrown out .<endOfText>
<bot>'Cos there's that  what were they doing  they'd be doing  and the bread the bread and milk comes every day and then I think the meat,meat comes once every week, like.<endOfText>
<human>My bread I get from Tesco's.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you?<endOfText>
<human>I get from the Co-op next door.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, sometimes Tesco's, sometime.<endOfText>
<human>I used to pay this friend to go like into Tesco's.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Sometimes James go up or Dennis goes up.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>If not they go to the Co-op, but Tesco's bread is cheaper.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm, but .<endOfText>
<human>I mean, we, we used to have, like, we'd have  meat come twice a week, they're the butchers, and then we'd have  coming, maybe, erm, once a week, and then like the dry goods, er, erm, we'd have another day, where erm, you know, you have different things, basically coming every day.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>and the milkman would come and everything else, and now it's all central distribution, and erm,meat, you know, do central distribution, for the whole thing, and erm, they, all the companies that used to deliver to us individually, they deliver to the central depot,and they, in turn, distribute it to all the houses,<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>and it's a much better system, overall, which is, you know, you don't have to ring up some many different people every week.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Ringing up for one order, so it does work out better now.<endOfText>
<human>It's really funny, because, we know our   Hello,Bet it's <endOfText>
<bot>Hi.<endOfText>
<human>She's just walked in   <endOfText>
<bot>I had a feeling I knew it would be you.<endOfText>
<human>Hi yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>There's no one else that walks into our house, without ringing the bell.<endOfText>
<human>Just goes for it.<endOfText>
<bot>How are you.<endOfText>
<human>Very well, thank you, how are you?<endOfText>
<bot>We bought you a drink <endOfText>
<human>Lovely and sweet <endOfText>
<bot>Bit disappointed in you.<endOfText>
<human>You didn't do very well over the weekend, did you, 'cos I was watching them and they didn't do that well.<endOfText>
<bot>I know, he didn't really have a good  he had a good day in the Mail on Sunday, though.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>oh right.<endOfText>
<human>I thought  as in <endOfText>
<bot>Italy, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Oh my life.<endOfText>
<bot>You haven't got your new clothes on.<endOfText>
<human>I know I haven't.<endOfText>
<bot>You got <endOfText>
<human>you got them down here.<endOfText>
<bot>Aye?<endOfText>
<human>Have you got them down here?<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>I told her to bring them down <endOfText>
<bot>You haven't even got, you haven't even got your <endOfText>
<human>No, sorry.<endOfText>
<bot>She's got holes in those bloody jean, look at her.<endOfText>
<human>I know, sorry.<endOfText>
<bot>Ar, look at all these apologies <endOfText>
<human>she's having to make, you wicked things.<endOfText>
<bot>I always come round in my jeans.<endOfText>
<human>We always give her a hard time.<endOfText>
<bot>They're so mean to me.<endOfText>
<human>What have you lot been up to?<endOfText>
<bot>Nothing.<endOfText>
<human>Just watching the box ,<endOfText>
<bot>And we're just sitting here, talking about food.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Just lazing around, really.<endOfText>
<human>How's work going?<endOfText>
<bot>Really fun.<endOfText>
<human>It hasn't been that busy, it's not busy.<endOfText>
<bot>Isn't it?<endOfText>
<human>It's just not like home, at home.<endOfText>
<bot>Like if I worked at home on Saturday night, and I worked at home on a Sunday lunch-time it would be really, really busy all the time, and like there's four areas to cover in  and there's only two areas and I think its too <endOfText>
<human>It's so weird though, cos The Rising Sun, it's not as if it's not central,<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>it's on the way to bloody Richmond, you think it would be busy, wouldn't you?<endOfText>
<bot>That's weird.<endOfText>
<human>Just a small  <endOfText>
<bot>On the main road .<endOfText>
<human>When we were in there, that Bank Holiday Monday, it was really busy, wasn't it.<endOfText>
<bot>Well.<endOfText>
<human>Was it really busy, or was the bar service just crap.<endOfText>
<bot>The bar service is crap.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>There's only one person on <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm,<endOfText>
<human>I mean, there were people in there, though,<endOfText>
<bot>No, that's true.<endOfText>
<human>you know, I mean, Sunday lunch certainly wasn't any busier than that was.<endOfText>
<bot>Mind you, anywhere would be busy on a Bank Holiday.<endOfText>
<human>Dead.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, it's not dead, but like, when there are two of you on, you're not exactly taxed.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, when we went to a  erm, they phoned, we wen , the woman, we said, ah, with the Rising Sun'll be, do you think the Rising Sun will be full as well, 'cos she phoned for us.<endOfText>
<human>And they phoned up, and they were fully booked until about four o'clock, so   a Bank Holiday.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, I mean, there were a lot of people in there on on Sunday.<endOfText>
<human>There was peo , there was loads of people waiting in the bar, for tables for the restaurant.<endOfText>
<bot>But, like, we weren't rushed off our feet, is what I  <endOfText>
<human>no thank you.<endOfText>
<bot>People sat at all the tables in the bar, and some tables, there was like two lots of people sat around the same table, sharing a table.<endOfText>
<human>And then you had twenty people, well, over twenty people sat in the window, and they all had bar meals, and they'd all been to do with this run, you know, there's a big run through Twickenham on a Sunday morning,<endOfText>
<bot>going on the way to work.<endOfText>
<human>And they'd all been in the run, so they all came in for lunch, and they, you know, it's like twenty bar meals, and then they were coming up to drink, to order drinks, they were doing like ten drinks at a time.<endOfText>
<bot>But even that wasn't, you know, it wasn't any effort,<endOfText>
<human>No  <endOfText>
<bot>not like at <endOfText>
<human>oh here he comes.<endOfText>
<bot>And these take it down off the counter and do it like this, and I'm getting more strength in my hands, now, because I'm using them to do more.<endOfText>
<human>Do you think perhap , erm, because it's not so busy, do you think perhaps they've cut back in the restaurant, and that's why you're doing a bit more work  for the restaurant, you know, doing the floaters and things.<endOfText>
<bot>No, no, that's the way these places are run.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I thought perhaps it's because it  <endOfText>
<human>They haven't got the facilities, facilities couldn't be anywhere but where they are, and that's how, erm, Beefeaters do their, set their bars up.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I see.<endOfText>
<bot>Bar staff with help with the coffees <endOfText>
<human>But they've got more of a concentration on the restaurant, whereas we haven't, we have a busy time and without a busy  <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, that's true.<endOfText>
<human>You know.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>Yours is busy both sides, isn't it really.<endOfText>
<bot>Whereas this is just one bar, with about five regular customers,as far as I can work out.<endOfText>
<human>Is there any night during the week, where you're not, the bar's not particularly busy, you'd say?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, I mean, early week, Monday, Tuesday, well, you see, then we have like erm,<endOfText>
<human>going.<endOfText>
<bot>Erm,<endOfText>
<human>Who's going  <endOfText>
<bot>say, like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday we won't be that busy.<endOfText>
<human>but Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, we have, they'll be darts matches, and they'll be pairs matches, and they'll be <endOfText>
<bot>Oh really.<endOfText>
<human>there's women darts, there's mens darts, and they might not all come in till about nine o'clock, but they are only like, two hours  <endOfText>
<bot>A very popular pub, yours, isn't it, why do you think that is?<endOfText>
<human>Is it because  <endOfText>
<bot>The area, I mean, we back onto a big council estate.<endOfText>
<human>Really?<endOfText>
<bot>And then there's another housing estate over the other side of us as well.<endOfText>
<human>Is there not any pubs .<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>no.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't think so.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I mean, the next pubs are right over the side of the hospital,<endOfText>
<bot>Really?<endOfText>
<human>all the way along to the Windmill, so, like the area we cover, there's a lot of people, and like, the middle part, it's very nice up there, you might, really attracts middle-class people, that we get out, for middle-class, middle-aged people that could go and sit in there for a drink.<endOfText>
<bot>And there's the other bar.<endOfText>
<human>And then the public bar's there, for everyone  else, sort of thing, and erm,<endOfText>
<bot>you know that that's that but no, not even that, you know, really, erm, I mean, they, the public bars are supposed to be aimed at people of a lower social status.<endOfText>
<human>Bad innit when they go round giving these areas for people.<endOfText>
<bot>But erm.<endOfText>
<human>But that's just the way they'd rather be.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, that's true, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>probably local, and, I mean the bar the prices for drinks are always cheaper in the bar, as well.<endOfText>
<bot>Are they really?<endOfText>
<human>Always.<endOfText>
<bot>Always have been until now, but now they're the same price everywhere.<endOfText>
<human>Oh.<endOfText>
<bot>aren't they?<endOfText>
<human>But we're the cheapest pub in Twick Twickenham.<endOfText>
<bot>Are you really?<endOfText>
<human>Are ya.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't understand it.<endOfText>
<human>Well, I do understand it now, because we've looked through it, but I understand it <endOfText>
<bot>Nor did I <endOfText>
<human>I haven't even got it.<endOfText>
<bot>I was so frustrated with it, I gave up <endOfText>
<human>timberland.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Good old timberland.<endOfText>
<bot>Alright.<endOfText>
<human>I know, it's amazing that they haven't gone downwards, have they.<endOfText>
<bot>How long have you been doing all this?<endOfText>
<human>er, about two years <endOfText>
<bot>Are they really comfy?<endOfText>
<human>Very comfortable, yes.<endOfText>
<bot>The bloke that I went to  out with.<endOfText>
<human>picnic.<endOfText>
<bot>Karl, and I for one decided it was too big for me so I  I went round and of course I didn't.<endOfText>
<human>How much were they?<endOfText>
<bot>About a hundred.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, about a hundred and twenty-five, now.<endOfText>
<bot>Can you cancel that cheque?<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>I have.<endOfText>
<human>You have, the cheque,well done, yes <endOfText>
<bot>Well done.<endOfText>
<human>Well, I suppose to find out his surname, but I haven't found it out, but they said they would stop it anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, again, I don't understand him like, and I don't know.<endOfText>
<human>You might know.<endOfText>
<bot>I don't want to know.<endOfText>
<human>Well done.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, that's good.<endOfText>
<human>So how much did you get?<endOfText>
<bot>A hundred and forty-seven quid.<endOfText>
<human>Was it?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, it still doesn't give me any money, but it just stops more money going  out of my account.<endOfText>
<human>At least your overdrafts a bit better.<endOfText>
<bot>Did, do they oh, with a  card, they don't charge for cancellations of er, cheques, do they?<endOfText>
<human>Yes, they bloody well do.<endOfText>
<bot>They do!<endOfText>
<human>What!<endOfText>
<bot>I thought that was like er <endOfText>
<human>How much?<endOfText>
<bot>I don't honestly <endOfText>
<human>I didn't know you had to pay if you cancelled a cheque?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, real bastards, banks.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, real bastards.<endOfText>
<human>Anything.<endOfText>
<bot>They make their money innit.<endOfText>
<human>They charge it.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you know, the slightest thing that's out of the ordinary, they'll charge you for doing it.<endOfText>
<human>It's like you haven't, if you wanna get money out, but you haven't got your card, it's not your branch, you get charged<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>for taking money out.<endOfText>
<bot>I got charged when I did it in Newmarket.<endOfText>
<human>Really? that's disgusting, really.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yes, it's really bad, I mean, it's your bank.<endOfText>
<human>That's how they make their money, though, isn't it?<endOfText>
<bot>I mean, you know Louise, she erm, was two pounds overdrawn, erm, for about a day, she was sent a letter to say that she'd been charged twenty pounds for the letter,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, my sister <endOfText>
<bot>and she had a hundred pounds, she put a hundred pounds in to cover the, you know, to put her back into credit.<endOfText>
<human>So she's lost eighty, she's lost twenty pounds out of that hundred pounds though.<endOfText>
<bot>So she said she's, you know <endOfText>
<human>Is this  account?<endOfText>
<bot>She, yeah, she was overdrawn for for two at, for a day or something.<endOfText>
<human>So she's gonna write a really stinking letter, now.<endOfText>
<bot>Well, who, who does she bank with?<endOfText>
<human>I'm not really sure  <endOfText>
<bot>I'm lucky, Nat West don't charge  when I miles over my overdraft.<endOfText>
<human>Don't they?<endOfText>
<bot>They're quite used to it, I think.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, I still have to cancel that cheque, yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>And that was for the  <endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but I really  <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but I really ought to find out his  surname.<endOfText>
<human>Well, if they said they'd cancel it anyway.<endOfText>
<bot>What's his name?<endOfText>
<human>They said they would, but they said you ought to give us the surname.<endOfText>
<bot>Because when they , they know where it's coming from, sort of.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, but if you've only written one cheque in the past  whatever.<endOfText>
<bot>Don't know how many weeks it is.<endOfText>
<human>Who?<endOfText>
<bot>What's his first name?<endOfText>
<human>Will.<endOfText>
<bot>Will.<endOfText>
<human>Can you remember what what,<endOfText>
<bot>no <endOfText>
<human>Have you written down  didn't you write it in the in the margin?<endOfText>
<bot>I just put rent, you see.<endOfText>
<human>Oh.<endOfText>
<bot>That's what I put.<endOfText>
<human>So there's, there's erm,<endOfText>
<bot>Do you know who I might see, I might see that girl, Michelle who lived  'cos I saw her last Thursday, she was in the classroom next to us.<endOfText>
<human>Does erm, Brian now that you can't clear the cheque?<endOfText>
<bot>Well, she said, right, she said, er, he can't cash that cheque because his account's in Ireland, so can you get him out the cash instead.<endOfText>
<human>And I just said, I'm not walking around with a hundred and fifty quids worth of money.<endOfText>
<bot>Get mugged.<endOfText>
<human>Not even even gonna  <endOfText>
<bot>And he didn't say anything more about it?<endOfText>
<human>I'm not gonna pay it,because I can't afford to.<endOfText>
<bot>Not going to either, I stayed there one night.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>And I gave them loads of money,<endOfText>
<human>When did you write the cheque out, you wrote it ages ago, didn't you?<endOfText>
<bot>When I was that, first week, the second week, was here.<endOfText>
<human>So has it has it gone out of your account?<endOfText>
<bot>Or is it <endOfText>
<human>No, it hasn't gone out, because he hasn't cashed it, you see.<endOfText>
<bot>He hasn't cashed it yet.<endOfText>
<human>Why did he take so long in cashing it?<endOfText>
<bot>Because his account's is in Ireland, so he  <endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>Funny really, not to cash a cheque   cheque, you know.<endOfText>
<human>Like because their account, you know, if you write, like if I wrote a cheque out to you today, and you didn't cash it for four weeks<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>in those four weeks, if I don't realize that that cheque hasn't cleared, like I don't even no what cheques are cleared 'cos I haven't got a date written on it.<endOfText>
<bot>Nor did I.<endOfText>
<human>You think you've got more money than what you have.<endOfText>
<bot>yeah.<endOfText>

<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Mm.<endOfText>
<bot>just stressed out.<endOfText>
<human>Mind you, erm, I haven't been conscious about him at all, even when he was on the first of all.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>I suppose it was because he used to be so, you know,<endOfText>
<bot>If you know what it's about.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, well, yeah <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, but he won't.<endOfText>
<human>If you like him, or he was doing other <endOfText>
<bot>I have been taped before.<endOfText>
<human>My sister's put it on sometimes, and I really sort of oh,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah,<endOfText>
<human>don't do that,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>don't do that.<endOfText>
<bot>I'm really sort of stopping my myself from saying things, but <endOfText>
<human>If people think they hear,, when they think listening to you, then  what you're talking about.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>What you're talking about.<endOfText>
<bot>I think that's what they want.<endOfText>
<human>They're gonna be looking at you.<endOfText>
<bot>Mm.<endOfText>
<human>You know.<endOfText>
<bot>they might have a, they might spend a bit of time  topic, but they want, they're just looking at you know  variations in <endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>I am more aware, like, you know, people, of what people say.<endOfText>
<human>I am now.<endOfText>
<bot>And the other day, the other day, erm, you would say, erm, you know that sheet with silence topic, erm, always the right to choose a topic, and turn taking.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>and it was all split up into the different seminar group, we we had to take one aspect.<endOfText>
<human>Each one of us, and and do it, and I had topic turn.<endOfText>
<bot>Topic, we had the right to choose topic, and then one girl <endOfText>
<human>Come in.<endOfText>
<bot>one girl, erm, she was saying, she was saying about the turn taking, and the theory is is that people <endOfText>
<human>Hi.<endOfText>
<bot>Hello.<endOfText>
<human>If you're in a big conversation, if you're in a big group.<endOfText>
<bot>Hi, Nicole.<endOfText>
<human>You usually look at that person, and when you coming to the end of your your your speel, you sort of look at the one person.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>and she was there, and I thought<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>and like in the extreme theory, in extreme examples, like you you say right it's auto speak <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>like Beckie.<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>and I just didn't agree with it and I'm trying to sort of, they say in your subconscious you do sort of look at and the last person erm, will look at you, you get <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>generally speaks.<endOfText>
<bot>So you're thinking line,<endOfText>
<human>So I've been trying, I've been trying to sort of, I I was arguing saying, I don't think that's true.<endOfText>
<bot>What's this then?<endOfText>
<human>Language.<endOfText>
<bot>I was saying, I don't think it's true at all, but erm, I don't know, I'm trying to figure out whether it's actually true or not.<endOfText>
<human>Say  replies, that if someone else has got something to say, they'll sa they'll  <endOfText>
<bot>Yeah, that's what I was saying, that was was my argument.<endOfText>
<human>I was.<endOfText>
<bot>Can I make a cup of tea?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, of course you can.<endOfText>
<bot>As I was saying, erm, so many people have got different ideas.<endOfText>
<human>Even if you'd been arrest if I put my eyes and rest them on you.<endOfText>
<bot>What what if you haven't got anything to say?<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, that's true.<endOfText>
<bot>But if somebody answered the question and say something else.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So I suppose you've got to take it with a pinch of salt and it isn't true so some ways, but I don't know.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I was arguing black and blue, and I was the only one, sort of saying, oh no I don't think that's right.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh at least you, you know stuck by what you thought.<endOfText>
<human>stuck by your guns .<endOfText>
<bot>'Cos everyone, she was reading this out, and everyone was going, yeah, yeah and it sounded so stupid and I thought,<endOfText>
<human>Agreeing with it, Yeah <endOfText>
<bot>I don't agree with this, I think this is really.<endOfText>
<human>I mean, I said I didn't agree with it, but everyone said, oh no, it is true.<endOfText>
<bot>I made you wrong, and I said, well I still don't agree with it, and I sort of explained exactly what I thought.<endOfText>
<human>Did you get much done, Nicole?<endOfText>
<bot>I thought,<endOfText>
<human>Are reading the Alchemist?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>I got into bed, and I was really nice and warm, and I was lying back, I don't really like to lie back when I'm doing something, I like to sit up in bed, I don't generally do work in bed.<endOfText>
<bot>If I read I like to sit up, if I start to lie down I was like this.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>So I've had to come down and  <endOfText>
<human>I was in the library.<endOfText>
<bot>It started coming freezing<endOfText>
<human>But there's no room in there, Nicole.<endOfText>
<bot>It is nice and warm in there.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, I was sitting in the sun as well, over by the window there.<endOfText>

<human>That's true.<endOfText>
<bot>It so annoying with not understanding every line.<endOfText>

<human>Anything will do.<endOfText>
<bot>Mike organized it, for me to go over there and then  I didn't need to be there at all, cos noth nobody turned up.<endOfText>
<human>Ah.<endOfText>
<bot>So I've er <endOfText>
<human>I'm sure they're really grateful for you <endOfText>
<bot>I don't think Maryanne even knows I've been there.<endOfText>
<human>You don't think what?<endOfText>
<bot>Maryanne knows I've been.<endOfText>
<human>No.<endOfText>
<bot>Do you arrange it all, then?<endOfText>
<human>I think, yeah, well he rang me, so erm, I think she was expecting, I think they, when they left the house this morning, he was thinking, he'd be able to get home in time for it, and erm, then he got to work and the day wasn't, hadn't worked out the way he expected.<endOfText>
<bot>And like, did you hear about that unexploded bomb, in the Second World War, the two thousand pound bomb on the <endOfText>
<human>News last night.<endOfText>
<bot>No.<endOfText>
<human>Do you want tea or coffee,?<endOfText>
<bot>I'll have a coffee, please.<endOfText>
<human>There was two thousand pound, Second World War bomb, they found in Walton, which is right near the River Thames which is, like, past Hampton Court, and Mike said that he'd have to go out there today, and it's er erm, this guy who he works for, owns a Leisure Centre right beside where this bomb is.<endOfText>
<bot>So he'll need to go down there with his associates and had to evacuate the Leisure Centre.<endOfText>
<human>Oh, really?<endOfText>
<bot>They just found this bomb and they were going to have a controlled explosion at the car park <endOfText>
<human>Oh.<endOfText>
<bot>So, that made the day a bit more interesting, but he's been stuck with er, all these upper class councillors that telling him what his job is, and  <endOfText>
<human>Don't go down very well.<endOfText>
<bot>He said, he's not impressed, and er, I think the idea that go   at a meeting today,<endOfText>
<human>Yeah, turn that power off before you do any more to that  it's silly isn't it ?<endOfText>
<bot>Erm.<endOfText>
<human>Yeah.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, buggery bollocks  you take yours anyway,get on  <endOfText>
<human>Erm, so   like all their ideas, on the erm, you know the ideas they were putting<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>were that in, in the borough there's lots of like fallen land, like, you know, Esher Common and things like that,<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>that they thought they could develop and hav hold events on, and er, he said, like we, we came up with some good ideas, put forward some ideas, really good ideas, for things to do on this land, and he said, the trouble is that all these councillors back on to these pieces of land, and he said, er, they don't want people coming along and enjoying themselves on it, because they want to go and walk their labradors on it.<endOfText>
<bot>Oh, I see.<endOfText>
<human>So it might disturb their neighbourhood, you know, so they weren't very impressed with his ideas.<endOfText>
<bot>Ow.<endOfText>
<human>So er, he hasn't had a very good day at work, a bit fed up.<endOfText>
<bot>But Alfie's coming down tonight, and they're going out.<endOfText>
<human>Does he come down and visit quite a lot?<endOfText>
<bot>Yeah.<endOfText>
<human>Does he?<endOfText>
<bot>He's his partner in crime, as he calls it.<endOfText>
<human>Do you think Maryanne's alright about that?<endOfText>
<bot>Oh yeah, yeah.<endOfText>
<human>All friends together as it were.<endOfText>
